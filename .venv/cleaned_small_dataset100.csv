She enjoys matching up each character (each one is holding a number) with their spot on the play mat. I would jokingly say ""OK, I'm going to put this FOUR on the mat"" while holding a SEVEN & she would giggle uncontrollably and say ""That's NOT A FOUR"". If she forgets the name of a number she can find out for herself by simply placing it on the proper spot on the mat. I thought this feature alone was well worth the money. The other counting and play parts are just an added bonus. Yes the mat has a little fold in it from the way it was packaged but it doesn't affect the play at all......",5.0,Excellent Educational Tool,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",wish bought sooner yr old daughter loves playing days time learned almost every number sight enjoys matching character one holding number spot play mat would jokingly say ok im going put four mat holding seven would giggle uncontrollably say thats four forgets name number find simply placing proper spot mat thought feature alone well worth money counting play parts added bonus yes mat little fold way packaged doesnt affect play,1

It didn't take too long. The Disney Princess castle was much more work than this setup. This took about 15 minutes give or take a few. The quality of this is a little ho-hum.

My friend used this with her two daughters and wrote the review since she got to experience it first hand.My daughter is 5 months old and fell in LOVE with this table the moment I took it out of the box. This was the first real ""toy"" that she has been able to play with and I am super happy that it worked well with her.Even my 4 year old plays with this table! For some reason she is mesmerized by it! She has played with it for HOURS without a single sign of boredom! That is saying something! I am very happy with the fact that this seems to be a toy that my girls can play with together. There aren't a lot of products that encourage them to do that at this age. This table is big enough and has enough interactive options that it can keep both of them happy and engaged for long periods of time.I like that if they don't play with it for a few minutes (probably more like 30 seconds) it will say something like, ""Hello, are you there?"" or ""Let's play!"" this really pulls my girls in. Especially the 4 year old! She was fussing at the table the other day because the phone kept ringing. She said that her friends wanted to talk way too often and she was just too busy typing on the computer. HeheIt has a ton of things to keep her entertained from interactive parts, to a variety of sound options. It can even speak Spanish to her!Her favorite part seems to be the book and ball at the moment. (They are the easiest for her to manipulate) She just can't stop giggling anytime she rolls the ball or turns a page which makes things light up and noises happen.As a mom, I love the fact that it has different settings. This will make it so that she can enjoy it for a longer period of time. Not only do you have options for the sounds (ABCs/123s, music, Spanish/English, and interactive real life sounds) but you can also set it up in different ways. You may choose to either lay it flat on the floor, which is perfect for babies just learning to sit, or set it up on it's legs which encourages standing play!I only have two complaints so far. One is that it doesn't have a volume control. Any mom with the ""noise making"" toys knows that volume control is an important one! Two, while the Spanish option is great, it says the English word first and with as fast as my girls are hitting the buttons and moving pages the Spanish words are seldom heard. I would definitely recommend this toy to others, even with the two issues I have.

However, I also smelled the gang, and they are still slightly kickin'. Am I worried about that smell? Yes. Does the worry about that smell keep me up at night? No...I am more worried about high power lines in my backyard, traffic accidents, pesticides, and my kid's social life right now, and it's not like she is constantly caressing the van and snuggling with it in bed at night. One of the doors of the van did fall off for several days when first purchased, and the door has a majority of the time stayed on since then (I am not sure if my toddler is pulling it off on purpose- she has a thing about the driver-side door being off on vehicles...strange.) Just make sure it ""snaps"" when putting said door(s) back on. No flowers- we'll live. Ray gun- I am not a stickler when it comes to ""Scoobia"" details. I am guessing that it just added more appeal to the male rugrats. Map dial inside of van is cool, but hard for kids to turn.

2494,AT1GMH2UHYROT,B00000DMBB,Lee DeWald,"[72, 75]","This is another childhood favorite that has not diminished with age.  This game is as fun now as it was in grade school.&quot;Battleship&quot; has a lot to do with strategy and luck.  You have to strategically place your pieces on the grid so they won't get &quot;hit&quot; and you have to use that and a little bit of luck to do your darndest to sink your opponent's ships.  It can get pretty tense when both players only have one ship left, and one wrong move (or right move depending upon your situation) can end the game.Fun: Like I said earlier, this is a childhood favorite of mine.  When it was raining outside during recess, we would always play this in the classroom.  &quot;Connect Four&quot; tournaments and &quot;Battleship&quot; tournaments were the norm when I was in grade school.Educational: &quot;Battleship&quot; is essentially a thinking game, although a little bit of luck plays into it, too.  Both players really have to use their smarts to come out the victor in this game.  Seasoned veterans know all too well how strategy can cripple a rookie opponent.Durability: Both game pieces are like a mini-laptop in a hard plastic casing.  So it is indeed very durable.  The only thing that could cause a problem are the little red and white pegs with which you mark the game board.  These can be a hassle to pick up if a game board is dropped and it accidently opens up, sending zillions of little pegs rolling around on the floor.  These can also be a choking hazard to young people, so that needs to be taken into account as well.If you love games that will make you think, or you are just someone looking for a fun challenge, &quot;Battleship&quot; is a great game to pick up.

Just like its predecessor, it went on to win a string of awards. It's also a party game, but borrowed elements from Wits & Wagers that helped make it stand apart from most traditional party games.In Say Anything, players write answers to a question asked by another player, and score points by trying to guess which of the answers they think he'll pick. Think: Apples to Apples meets Balderdash meets Wits & Wagers. Questions are ones like these: ""What would be the dumbest thing to say in a job interview?"" ""What would be the weirdest thing to collect?"" ""What's the most important quality a person can have?"" Now comes the fun part: Can you think of an answer that the person whose turn it is might pick as the best one? And when everyone has written their answers, can you guess which one you think he'll pick once you see the answers others have written? This bidding/guessing mechanic keeps everyone in the game, and is what makes the game fun for gamers and non-gamers alike.Say Anything is flexible, very interactive, highly social, and once again it has a huge fun element.
