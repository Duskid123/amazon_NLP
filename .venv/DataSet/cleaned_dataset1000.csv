165261,A30638B9S2GOM8,B00FG1U7FQ,apples2apples,"[0, 0]","Koryo is an enjoyable game that has many more pluses than minuses.  It only takes 15 minutes or so to play once you get the hang of it - which happens after just a couple of games. It's great because you get to start again quickly if things aren't going well in the current game. Some of the other card games out there can be SO time consuming, which isn't always practical.The box indicates Koryo is for ages 14+.  There&#8217;s nothing in the game that&#8217;s inappropriate or overly complicated for younger players.  An average 10 or 11 year old should pick it up pretty quickly as our youngest son did.  I played with my 11 year old son and we had no difficulties.  He actually helped ME understand the challenging aspects!It&#8217;s really a numbers and logic game where you leverage the special abilities of each card type to achieve `the highest point total at the end.  We had to reference the &#8220;cheat sheet&#8221; pages that came with the instructions the first couple of times we played in order to remember the special abilities of each numbered set of cards.  Then we realized that the numbered cards had a small picture on the bottom center that gave a hint as to its abilities - after that we didn&#8217;t need the cheat sheet anymore.Play goes quickly through the 8 rounds.  You get dealt 10 cards for the first round declining by 1 with each successive round.  You play cards of 1 type in front of you but only get to keep up to 3 the first round with the number increasing by 1 each round.  At the end of each round you collect up the cards not played in front of you and reshuffle for the next round.  By having the most of any given numbered set in front of you, you get to &#8220;control&#8221; that card's special abilities. At the end of the last round add up the numbers of the sets you &#8220;control&#8221;.  And that determines the winner! Then you just reshuffle and play again!  We've both enjoyed playing and we've both experienced the thrill of victory a few times!The strategy changes with each game so you don&#8217;t grow tired of it and there will continue to be plenty of playability to the game.I didn&#8217;t really get the &#8220;political intrigue&#8221; of the game, so i'll have to look into that a little more.  The &#34;steampunk universe&#8221; aspects of the game isn't what you might think of if you're familiar with the Victorian Steampunk, or jewelry steampunk. This is Korean Steampunk, and it's revealed in the incredible artwork on the Koryo cards.Though we haven&#8217;t done it yet, we both think it will be even more fun with 3 or 4 players.",4.0,"Fun quick strategy card game, and not one you'll tire of quickly!",1405987200,"07 22, 2014",koryo enjoyable game many pluses minuses takes minutes play get hang happens couple games great get start quickly things arent going well current game card games time consuming isnt always practicalthe box indicates koryo ages theres nothing game thats inappropriate overly complicated younger players average year old pick pretty quickly youngest son played year old son difficulties actually helped understand challenging aspectsits really numbers logic game leverage special abilities card type achieve highest point total end reference cheat sheet pages came instructions first couple times played order remember special abilities numbered set cards realized numbered cards small picture bottom center gave hint abilities didnt need cheat sheet anymoreplay goes quickly rounds get dealt cards first round declining successive round play cards type front get keep first round number increasing round end round collect cards played front reshuffle next round given numbered set front get control cards special abilities end last round add numbers sets control determines winner reshuffle play weve enjoyed playing weve experienced thrill victory timesthe strategy changes game dont grow tired continue plenty playability gamei didnt really get political intrigue game ill look little steampunk universe aspects game isnt might think youre familiar victorian steampunk jewelry steampunk korean steampunk revealed incredible artwork koryo cardsthough havent done yet think even fun players,1

I had to read the directions several times before I understood how the game is played but basically one person is the hider and the other player is the seeker. Each turn, the hider hides one charm or character behind a window and the seeker has between 1-4 chances (depending on what they spin) to find a charm. They go back and forth taking turns until all of the cards are gone in the hiders stack.  Then the seeker counts the charms they found and the players are supposed to switch positions and play again to see who wins (i.e. who found more charms).One problem with this game is that it is very easy to cheat, even unintentionally, because the windows don't cover the holes all of the time or you might see which section of the building the hider is putting the charm. Also the odds of finding a charm are lower than I would hope for a preschool game because there 27 windows and only 8 charms.

They save our 20 month old lots of frustration... since he isn't old enough to understand the laws of physics and why his tracks simply won't stay in place :-)  They save daddy lots of frustration, since he doesn't have to set the track back up five times a day!Be warned though, they do not and AREN'T meant to work with every single piece of wooden track (I'm talking about the specialty tracks pieces).  They only work on the strait, curved, and the pieces that are meant to go up or down one level.And there is no need to lock ever piece of train track together.  For example, you won't need to buy 100 Sure Track pieces to go with your 100 piece train set.  One set of dozen will probably do just fine for most families.And these are amazing for creating those ""floating through the air"" type track set ups.  Sure Tracks doesn't always eliminated the need for support underneath the track, but since they're holding the actual pieces together, it does allow for more flexibility on where the supports can be placed.ALSO GO BUY THESE TOO:Your local dollar store sells little mini hair ties (for use one little girls hair... they're a little smaller than the size of a dime).  I picked up 500 clear bands for a dollar!!!!  Twist two or three around the ""male"" end of loose pieces.  Makes a world of difference and your track set up will stay together for hours!

Right now she's very eager about practicing writing her letters and numbers, and while good old paper and pen/pencil work just fine for this, it was fun to have something different that makes the practice seem more of a game.LeapFrog makes the learning more fun using a story you work your way through the book learning the proper way to write letters, and also the sounds they make.  Along the way there are little bonus and hidden items and games to keep things interesting.  One feature I like about this book is that they group 'like' letters together - those with straight lines are learned together, and those with loops, etc., so you're not going in your usual order of 'A,B,C', but it makes sense for somebody who is learning for the first time to learn similar shapes.The book includes a handful of special LeapFrog Learning Paper throughout the book for your child to practice on, and an extra packet of paper is included for additional practice as well.  All this 'Learning Paper' is, is carbon-pressure paper that shows marks when you press down on it.  It will be a fun novelty item for most kids, but once you use up the paper you can't re-use it.  As far as I can tell you cannot purchase the Learning Paper separately, so once it is used up you'll have to turn to pencil and paper for more practice.While nothing replaces the value of a child learning from a parent/teacher, this Learn to Write book is a fun way to encourage some independent learning and fun exploration, overall it's another great product from LeapFrog.",5.0,LeapFrog LeapReader Book: Learn to Write Letters with Mr. Pencil,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",year old going kindergarten next month excited give try received right shes eager practicing writing letters numbers good old paper penpencil work fine fun something different makes practice seem gameleapfrog makes learning fun using story work way book learning proper way write letters also sounds make along way little bonus hidden items games keep things interesting one feature like book group like letters together straight lines learned together loops etc youre going usual order abc makes sense somebody learning first time learn similar shapesthe book includes handful special leapfrog learning paper throughout book child practice extra packet paper included additional practice well learning paper carbonpressure paper shows marks press fun novelty item kids use paper cant reuse far tell purchase learning paper separately used youll turn pencil paper practicewhile nothing replaces value child learning parentteacher learn write book fun way encourage independent learning fun exploration overall another great product leapfrog,1

You have to use short strokes and squeeze the markers very hard to keep getting ink.-The paper cutouts are easy to punch out.-You have to be very careful how you attach the clips for the mobile. Because you plug them into the base (which spins two ways) you have to watch out or you tie up all the clips in one rotation.-The spinning shadow scene was a bit easier to use on the spinning base but still a pain to color.-The glowing colors were okay and it was fun to watch for a little while. The colors were not what a would consider an ""explosion"" however. They are very muted compared to the photo on the box.-The glow in the dark aspect only lasts 4 hours (according to the box.)

It's a great game that requires skills of questioning, deduction, and careful observation.  It was especially fun when you had to figure two people at once. There were two things wrong with the version I played as a kid: only 5 of the characters were female, and there was almost no racial diversity.I hoped these things would be improved in the new version when I bought it for my 4 year old daughter. Sadly, while the racial diversity has marginally improved, there are still only 5 females! When you are a 4 year old girl, you want to pick a girl, and in this case that means you always lose.  On top of that, the game production quality has plummeted. The illustrations should be much larger, like the original versions instead of the tiny pictures we get here. How are you supposed to ask detail-oriented questions without being able to clearly see what you are asking questions about?

He sings and claps along with the songs, and still sleeps with Scout every night. Somehow we misplaced him for a couple days, and when we found him, my kid seriously did a dance and sat and talked to Scout for probably an hour because he was so excited to see him. I've found that the best way to clean him is just to put some fabric detergent on a wash cloth and scrub, and put him in the sun to dry. The fur will be a little stiff afterward but it'll soften in a couple days and at least he'll be clean and not smell like toddler hands anymore.We don't typically buy my son stuffed toys because our dogs will try to eat them, and we rarely let him have electronic toys, so I didn't really go in to this with high hopes. To be honest, I didn't want anything to do with it. I was wrong. It was a gift from a friend, and as soon as we took the wrapping paper off it, my son was totally in love.

I set it up in front of my 46 inch LCD and couldn't see the TV anymore. That being said, my niece has a good time in there.The good:- BIG. Room for a few little ones or a little one and an adult.- Folds up when its time to put it away.- Comes with balls (not all of these do).- The balls it comes with are not overly hard, and have yet to lose their shape.- You can attach optional tunnelsThe bad:- It's BIG. This may be best in a dedicated playroom.- Not sure if we did this or if it came like this (I noticed after the little one played in it for a while) but I noticed a rip in the seam. It didn't affect the toy at all and it hasn't gotten any bigger in the months we've had it.- There is no padding on the bottom where you play. I recommend putting this on a carpet or other padded service for both safety and comfort.- Tips over easily. There is nothing stopping it from tipping over if the little one stands up and pushes against the side. I imagine this is the case with most of these ball pits though.- Balls don't stay inside. They easily get out. I find balls weeks later. But to be honest, I don't see how they could improve on this design. If the sides were any higher, the little ones would have trouble getting out. If they were harder, it could hurt their heads if they fall.- Not enough balls to cover the bottom. Although I think there are enough balls for play, some may want to purchase another 100 to fully cover the floor of the toy. But remember, more balls = more balls getting out of the pit.- Folding it is a bit of a pain. The instructions that come with it don't appear to be for the specific model you get. Once you get the hang of it though it is pretty easy. I think the most important part of the instructions is when it says you have to have your hands at slightly different heights and then fold inward. You will know what I mean if you decide to purchase this.- If you get an optional tunnel, the way it is attached isn't all that great. I would have loved to see some kind of zipper attachment. As I am writing this I forget exactly how you attach it, but I remember that it never really stayed securely in place.If I could I would give this item a 3.5.

There's a bright yellow building with a green roof, 2 see-through white doors, a ""PAINT SHOP"" sign above 2 white see-through windows, and a door that drops down for colorful yellow little Bill to chug into for storage.  When you start getting multiples of the trains via playsets and themed packs, it's always nice when they have something differentiating them from the ones sold individually - in this case, Bill is splattered with red paint!  The other ""building"" in this set is the ""ELSBRIDGE LIBRARY"", which shows a painter putting on a fresh coat of red paint over the previously blue brick walls.  There are 2 ""windows"" through which you can see shelves of books inside, and the painter outside is surrounded by a ladder with a ""WET PAINT"" sign, a few orange/white cones, a few paint cans/roller & tray/brushes sitting on a drop cloth, as well as an open can atop a stepladder.  Inside the grey oval track (which can connect at 4 places to other playsets or track) is a ""grassy"" area with wheels, wrenches, rocks and plants strewn about, and a little turtle about to enter a small blue pond.

The build quality was typical of what one expects from cheap stuff - poor.  Uneven seams where the components of each item were glued together, creating somewhat sharp edges.  This was especially evident by the smaller rolling pin, and the handles of the two cutters.  The large roller and large rolling pin both had burrs in the rollers from when the sections were broken from the molds.  The wheel of the irregular cutter rubs hard against the handle during use as not enough clearance between then was made to account for the play of the wheel on its shaft.

However then we saw the table in the store and he loved it.  We purchased it for him for his birthday, but let him play with it for a day to make sure he'd like it enough to warrent the price tag.  He couldn't get enough of it!Within minutes he'd learned to slide the trombone, push the lever for the cello and flip the lever for the bango.  The little door that says ""hello"" and ""bye-bye"" fasinates him as well as the spinner with the beads.  He has never really danced to music before, but after playing with this table for one day, he is now dancing to the music this and his other toys make.  I think he noticed that the table was not in the mix of other toys the next morning and I'm sure he's wondering where it went.Pros:Unlike some other tables we tested, this one has some rubber grip on the feet to keep it from scooting on the carpet.  It does scoot a little on the hardwood, though.Two volume settings, and the louder isn't too loud.Can still be utilized if the table is turned off completely, unlike some other tables we looked at.  Great to keep baby occupied and save mommy's sanity.Wide variety of music.  I'm not sure exactly how many songs this plays, but I would guess at least 20.Cons:The sound the trombone makes is really a muted trumpet.  Baby isn't going to know this, but it bugs me.The hinge on the little door on the hidden compartment is flimsy and the door comes off easily.  Maybe that's just on our table, though, because we got a display to save a little money.There are limited places for baby to put his hands that don't have ativities associated with them.  As such, my supported stander keeps flipping one thing but balancing himself on another activity, which overrides the first.  Eventually he'll grow out of that ""challenge"" but it seems to frustrate him a bit now.Overall this is a wonderful table and I'm glad I didn't make too hasty of a judgement of it before seeing it in the store.

This set has three nice images of dolphins.

By my third or fourth play through it easily became one of my favorite games of all time.  Up to seven knights set out about various quests and must work together to defeat the forces of evil.  In this semi-cooperative game each turn players must take an action for evil- take a hit, draw an evil card with dire effects for the knights, or place a siege engine before Camelot.  Then they can take their own action like moving to a quest, playing cards to work upon completing a quest, drawing good cards, or fighting a siege engines.  It is surprising just how quickly the various evil actions spell real trouble for the knights, so they must work together to make the best decisions for all.The problem, however, is that one of the knights is secretly an agent of evil, and wins the game if the knights lose.  Every turn you will be questioning why a knight chose to lay a siege engine, why they didn't take that hit point, why they did something else that looks suspicious.  You and your friends will freak out and then laugh a lot with this game.  Needless to say you will have a lot of fun as you either must bluff or figure out just who the traitor is before it's too late.

This ""toy"" is not going to help junior identify and track a Bigfoot.  The proportions are all wrong and it even looks friendly - unless I've missed a bulletin, there's no evidence to suggest that Sasquatch are friendly, or even capable of smiling.  Overall, I'm not sure what the intent of this product is.  I may be in the minority here, but I see no purpose in buying children nonfunctional toys - that is, toys that do not serve learning or training purposes.  If I want to see my kid laugh, I'll let him tour the family slaughterhouse.Areas of disappointment:1.  The acrobatic movements.  While cute and amusing, if a Sasquatch actually performed the front roll demonstrated on the box, it would probably snap its neck.  Remember, a real Sasquatch is estimated to weigh between 400 and 600 lbs.  With that kind of weight pressing down on the head, there's just no way Sasquatch could roll like that.2. The red ball.  In all the recorded evidence of Bigfoot encounters, not one has indicated Sasquatch has a proclivity for playing with or throwing balls.  In my estimation, it is more likely the Bigfoot would attempt to eat the ball.  Speaking of which, the green leaf is not actually digestible.3. Lack of ""tracking materials"".  Most Bigfoot hunters use footprints to track Sasquatch, however I have been (and continue to be) stunned by the lack of imitation biological material.  In the wild you are more likely to step in biomaterial than a foot print.  I've ruined a lot of biological evidence (and shoes) because I have failed to properly identify it.Areas of excitement:1.  Detachable arm.  This allows for the quick dismemberment of the Bigfoot.  In the wild, sometimes you will not have time to aim your hunting rifle before the Sasquatch is upon you.  In those instances you need to rely on your training and large hunting knife.  With the detachable arm feature, you can train junior to disarm an angry Bigfoot.  Good thinking Fisher Price!2. Human emotions.  Although there is no evidence Sasquatch possesses human-like emotions (or the capacity for speech) it is probably wise to include this feature.  When you're training junior it is best to assume the Sasquatch are more intelligent and cunning than reported.  You don't want junior to line up Bigfoot in his crosshairs only to have a moment of hesitation because the creature is giggling.  No, nothing should prevent the kill shot.Now, if you purchase this Bigfoot just to play with, then I have to admit, it is a neat ""toy"".

These take a lot of practice, and I realized how out of practice i was once I started manipulating the cards. Controlling the card and manipulating the card is part of the elegance of magic, so it's important to understand and know how to do it. It's necessary to be natural at your moves.The DVD includes 2 lessons on technique and 5 tricks. I would recommend watching and practicing the techniques again and again until you can perfect it as that is one of the most important parts of magic.The fact that this is a video dvd helps to see the tricks in action. And these tricks are ones that I haven't seen in magic lesson books either. But being able to replay the dvd again and again will help me learn the tricks.

We enjoy strategy games like Ticket to Ride and Power Grid.This game is all about bidding, so know that coming in.  You're bidding on crates of goods at specific ports.  Different ports have different amounts of crates.  Each crate is of one of nine specific items.  Each turn you may collect the goods if you're the only one left bidding for them; otherwise you can either drop from the bidding yourself, or increase your bid and stay for another round.  Once you've gotten your crates of goods, you can trade them in specific combinations (all the same good for a higher value, each crate of a different good for a lower value) to get cards indicating the spoils of wealth.  These cards have a cost and a value; the player with the highest accumulated value after a specific number of rounds is the winner.What's unusual about the game play is that each person takes their turn completely (there are 3 stages) before the next person begins.  This took a little getting used to. But overall, the game is not overly complicated, has an interesting dynamic, and was well thought out.I do agree that as opposed to other Days of Wonder games, this box for this one was very poorly designed.  There's no place to store your bag of ""crates"" once you've knocked them out from the originating cardboard sheets.  But this is a small flaw in an otherwise entertaining game.  We've played it several times and found it fast-paced and fun.  The backdrop of the game (different crime families from around the world) is also entertaining.

However, this toy requires some interest on the part of your child or your grown-up builder of models.  it works a lot like a puzzle.  The biggest complaint at first is that the pieces don't snap together as firmly as the Lego bricks but this is a more complex model designed to be built to ""spec"" and resemble the real deal.  There's no wiggle room for  adding on imaginary details.  However, this is a good thing!  The Model kit comes with a flyer about the REAL Missouri Battleship.What you get is 545 pieces to build the main battleship, the attack-boat, the figuurines and the firing missles and launchers.  the box opens up like a case and has enough illustrations on it to be very helpful if you come to a temporary impass in construction.  It took us about 5 nights of construction whip this baby into shape but it was worth it!  It was the first time the whole family came together to create something in a while!  While this Ship is designed to battle the Aliens from the Motion Picture, it does give you a chance to explain the history of The Missouri and its role in previous conflicts.  We have a history buff kid, so this was terrific!  The action figures include humans and aliens so there's room for a veriety of play.The price might deter you but since the world of BATTLESHIP the film and TRANSFORMERS pretty much align themsleves together well, any of the Transformers toys from KRE-O would also go together well with THE MISSOURI toy as well.  There's  a lot of ways to play with this toy and putting it together is ONLY ONE.  Once it's assembled, it should remain a staple in your 9 to 12 year old's play options.Also, if you go to their web site - just search for it on KRE-O and it will pop up. Once you register with them, there are more fun and adventures to explore.  Just make sure a parent helps with that since they need a parent's permission to log-in.

I'm not gonna tell you its bad,  but it has its flaws... read on.Pros,  The Lights!...  seriously this thing could probably be used to light up a room if the power goes out.  Disrupters are green and very bright,  torpedo tube is red and equally bright.  Engine lights up red, and there are yellow windows lit up o the ship.  Combine these with some sound effects and you get some cool patterns,  like when it de-cloaks, or fires.  The sound FX are all from startrek 6 and suit this model well.  Details,  the ship appears to be weathered and does a good job at it,  the details found in other DST ships are found here.Cons....  Q&A; rears its head again.  Certain panels are different shades of green,  and screw covers don't even match the colors of the plastic panels where they go.  This is really prevalent on the bottom of the ship in the rear under the base of the wings.

It takes at least three people to play properly, but they pulled it out anyway, and started going through the cards. Depending on the card you draw, you have to say a word, perform an action with or without making a sound, etc. Then you put your card face down and the next player draws, repeats what you did, then does the action on his card. It continues on until someone makes a mistake.Even if you're not playing the game ""properly"" it's a lot of fun.

It was a little tricky to assemble as the directions weren't as specific as I'd hoped, but I figured it out. There we a bunch of sections to assemble as well as stickers to apply. Insertion of batteries (not included) required a small screw driver and it was a little difficult to get the cover off. The instructions weren't clear about where the on/off switch was, but I found it by the front door.Kids love the sound effects and the lights. It comes with a little bit of furniture and a family of dolls, but most kids will want a lot more furniture, so consider this the first installment of several investments.Once it is assembled and set up, most features are perfectly smooth and functional. The only exception is the ""hidden"" playroom on the top. It's easy to pull up on it and snap it into place to reveal the secret room. but putting it back down is a lot trickier. It requires two hands pressing obscure buttons on the inside of the house at the same time. It isn't a quick release. I had to fiddle with it to lift the buttons just right. Most kids will have some trouble coordinating this.All in all, this is a great toy. I think it will stand up to a lot of use and it's a huge improvement over the version I had as a kid. I do think though, that it would be better with better assembly directions and an easier release for the hidden room.If you are purchasing this as a gift, be aware that it may not arrive in an Amazon box.

Wow.  Now take into account that the oven takes forever to get hot enough to &#34;cook&#34; and that there is no indicator as to when it is hot enough.  The directions for the included mix say that it is supposed to make 12 cookies -- is this a joke?? -- there is barely 1/3 cup of dry mix and to get 12 cookies you'd have to make them each about the size of a cough drop.  I bought several refill packs of mixes so that we'd be able to whip up a bunch of goodies over a weekend but after the initial cookies didn't cook until they'd been put back in the oven for double time, and given how difficult it was to find a tiny spoon to scoop little teeny cookie dough drops onto the cookie sheet, the kids all lost interest.

I really like the table and think that the variety of songs, activities, lights/sounds/cause and effects is great.

The 2 level sound is a nice option. I do feel that the legs do not provide enough height. The 16 month old is small for age and has to bend over to play with the table toy. A goal is to have the child stand up straight-extending hips and knees and this table only encourages a flexed body posture. There is also a switch next to the volume control which makes each of the activity functions change to a secondary set of songs, games, and cause and effects. The unit came with batteries which is great for gift giving ease, but I can not attest to the longevity of their life because I have only used the toy for several weeks.

This is a neat idea and makes for a fun toy, but it has some small problems.I have a 4 year old son and the whole family enjoyed putting this together.  It's fun to build structures and then throw a blanket over them to make a fort!  The cats love it too.This is a nice big size and a great idea. My son had no trouble popping the tubes in and out of the connectors.  There are a couple problems though.  Not enough connectors are included to make the structures shown; in fact there are way more tubes included than there are connectors.  If they would have included 2-3 more connectors it would have been a perfect number.The other big issue is the flexibility of the connectors.  It is nice to have a bit of give so that things don't need to line up perfectly.  The problem with these connectors is that they are very floppy; so they don't support the structure very well.  It took multiple people to hold the structure up while my son snapped the connectors together; once everything is perfectly balanced it will stand up fine, but until that point it is a struggle because the connectors don't provide support.Good:- Nice big size- Easy to pop the connectors in and out- Teaches creativity and geometry- Joints allow for a little bit of give, so you don't have to have things lined up exactlyImprovements Needed:- Not enough connectors (joints) included to make structures shown or even to use the tubes included- The connectors are made out of rubber and very floppy; this makes it hard to keep the structure stable unless everything is perfectly balance.  Also makes it hard for one person to put structures together.Overall this is a fun toy, especially with the winter coming up.  It is great fun to build forts with.

After endless struggles between them because little sister wanted to read with the pen too - I decided to get her one too.  I didn't want to get the Tag Jr. because it doesn't look the same and would not solve the envy problem I had working against me.  That being said I really didn't want to buy her 'regular paper' books just yet.  She's 50/50 on the destruction of them and most certainly can't left alone with them yet.  So I went onto LeapFrog's website and verified that all Tag Jr. books will work with the Tag Pen. The only thing is that with the Tag Pen books you can touch one word and it will read just that. Whereas Tag Jr. books you touch the page and it reads the whole page.  When you use the Tag Pen on Tag Jr. books it still will the entire page.  I can't speak to storage on the Tag Jr. but the Tag Pen I am able to store all of these books,LeapFrog Tag Learn to Read Phonics Book Series Short Vowels,LeapFrog Tag Book Finding Nemo: Lost And Found,LeapFrog Tag Junior Book: ABC Animal Orchestra, along with the sample book that comes installed.  That takes up just more than half of the storage on the pen so we certainly can add more.Now onto the specific review of this product.  These books are ok when it comes to the education value.  I really don't feel that they are truly trying to teach the kids to read or even really teach them vowel sounds, although they are all present an accounted for. The characters on them are fun and they all have a great 30+ second songs that my daughter loves to play and then hold the pen over her head and 'rock out' it's adorable!  So if you're looking for an educational tool to ""Get Ready to Read"" skip this.  If you are looking for entertainment for the younger audience - 5 Stars for sure.  My son (3.5) also loves these books because of the music.  Also I have to say the songs are NOT terribly annoying compared to a lot of kid products. Kudos LeapFrog!Would I buy this product again? For the price that I paid ($14.95) for the 5 books abosolutely.

For newbies, this version is highly accessible.The Flash Cubes are quicker and much more portable than regular Scrabble. Even in a car, the cubes work pretty well, as long as you have a relatively flat surface. So, that's one advantage over the board game. What I also liked, as a Scrabble fan, was that the cubes give you your score (number of words you found) and the maximum score possible, so you know how much room you have to improve for various combinations of letters. The cubes will alert each time you make a word, which gives newer players a chance to find words, even if they don't really know the dictionary. More experienced players will appreciate being alerted to words they didn't know. The ability to find words by luck won't eliminate the advantage of experience, but it will keep games more competitive and make the game easier for new players, especially younger players.Note about customer service: the first set of cubes I got didn't work right. One of the sensors that lets the cubes communicate wasn't working. The other cubes worked fine without it, but using that cube created problems. So I called Hasbro.

58966,A2SGLLZNNEG32C,B001TK3LOM,R. Mocan,"[7, 11]","Transformers - Revenge of the Fallen (ROTF) has generated a lot of speculation about the new characters and plot a couple of weeks before it's opening day.If you looked at the product picture, or at the movie's trailer, you already know that Sideways is a Decepticon robot whose alternate mode is an Audi R8... at least it is in the movie.The new line of toys for this second movie seems to be better made than the toys from the first movie. The Deluxe and Voyager lines of toys feature crisper detail in the molds, more accuracy to the screen appearances, better articulation and better paint applications. Some characters (Optimus and Starscream) even got updated and look gorgeous compared to their old 2007 selves.So, overall we can expect better looking robots and, of course, vehicles. This will appeal to more mature collectors (I'm 32), and certainly won't set back kids that play with their toys.I value the accuracy of the vehicles, and in this area the movie producers have one big advantage, because they use movies to advertise products and companies will even pay them to appear in the movie.On the other hand, toy manufacturers like Hasbro or Takara must ask these same companies for a license to use such vehicles as toys (and probably have to pay these same companies).Hasbro expressly states the license when a vehicle is depicted by one of their toys: just look at the back of the box of ROTF Deluxe Sideswipe and Bumblebee and you'll see GM's logo and the licensed vehicle's name (like Corvette Stingray Concept, Chevrolet Camaro) or the new Starscream (Lockheed Martin's F-22). This basically means that the company approved the toy and the toy depicts such a vehicle.Sideways's box does NOT show a license from Audi, and I strongly believe that Hasbro didn't get a license from them.Because of this, the Deluxe toy car looks like a bootleg Audi R8: It's like that car, but with the wrong vents, grille, lamps, exhaust, air intakes and body panels; with a longer bonnet but without the cool ""gills"" below all the lamps, or even the Audi logo.This is such a shame, when you consider the nice work they did with the GM cars (these cars feature the company insignia), or even the 2007's Saleen Ford Mustang that Barricade transforms into.So, overall:PROs:- Vehicle mode features painted body panels and transparent head/tail-ligths (BIG plus compared to 2007's Jazz Pontiac Solstice). A kid wouldn't mind the ""bootlegginess"" look of this toy.- Nice articulation in robot mode.- Nice representation of robot mode concept art.CONs:- Gear Alive gimmick is useless.- Lots of big transparent plastic that seems brittle and easy to break.- Vehicle mode looks like you didn't transform it well and couldn't get the pieces to fit.- Robot mode paint application is non-existent: most parts are the wrong color when compared to concept art from the internet.- This is not a problem of the toy itself, but conceptual design of the character looks too much like a recycled Barricade.At this moment we don'k know how big a part will this character play in the movie, and this could boost the coolness and ""desiredness"" of the character's toys.Based on the toy itself, I believe it'll appeal to younger collectors and kids older than 7. It's not suitable for small children because it's got pointy, sharp edges and brittle clear plastic in large proportions.",3.0,Audi R8 lookalike that transforms into Barricade lookalike...,1244764800,"06 12, 2009",transformers revenge fallen rotf generated lot speculation new characters plot couple weeks opening dayif looked product picture movies trailer already know sideways decepticon robot whose alternate mode audi r least moviethe new line toys second movie seems better made toys first movie deluxe voyager lines toys feature crisper detail molds accuracy screen appearances better articulation better paint applications characters optimus starscream even got updated look gorgeous compared old selvesso overall expect better looking robots course vehicles appeal mature collectors im certainly wont set back kids play toysi value accuracy vehicles area movie producers one big advantage use movies advertise products companies even pay appear movieon hand toy manufacturers like hasbro takara must ask companies license use vehicles toys probably pay companieshasbro expressly states license vehicle depicted one toys look back box rotf deluxe sideswipe bumblebee youll see gms logo licensed vehicles name like corvette stingray concept chevrolet camaro new starscream lockheed martins f basically means company approved toy toy depicts vehiclesidewayss box show license audi strongly believe hasbro didnt get license thembecause deluxe toy car looks like bootleg audi r like car wrong vents grille lamps exhaust air intakes body panels longer bonnet without cool gills lamps even audi logothis shame consider nice work gm cars cars feature company insignia even saleen ford mustang barricade transforms intoso overallpros vehicle mode features painted body panels transparent headtailligths big plus compared jazz pontiac solstice kid wouldnt mind bootlegginess look toy nice articulation robot mode nice representation robot mode concept artcons gear alive gimmick useless lots big transparent plastic seems brittle easy break vehicle mode looks like didnt transform well couldnt get pieces fit robot mode paint application nonexistent parts wrong color compared concept art internet problem toy conceptual design character looks much like recycled barricadeat moment donk know big part character play movie could boost coolness desiredness characters toysbased toy believe itll appeal younger collectors kids older suitable small children got pointy sharp edges brittle clear plastic large proportions,0

59768,A2DCL6G68IOL3B,B001US4DOK,C. Gahler,"[2, 2]","I wanted to give our 3 year old daughter an early start on Legos but didn't want to make the short term investment on Duplo. The minimum age for any set of regular sized Legos seems to be 4+ so I knew I was starting her early. This review may help others who are thinking about then to get their little ones started. All kids are different of course but here is one dad's experience.We do our best to find a balance between ""cute little girl"" and ""don't gender stereotype!"" My initial thought was starting with a kit like this will grab her attention with the big pink box (it did!) but still introduce her to I construction toys. As soon as she upwrapped this Christmas present she wanted it opened. We went down to our little kid sized table and opened it up. The box is only about half filled, maybe a little less. I assume this is to allow for expansion of the set. I have no problem with this but be aware. The top snaps onto the box base firmly and would probably keep most toddlers from opening it. That is a good thing. The contents were sealed in 3-4 bags that daddy had to open but once the parts were dumped onto the table we were ready to go!Having some experience with Mega Bloks my daughter was quickly able to grasp the idea of how these things worked. She immediately started to join blocks together. At three I had no expectation that she would start building cars and houses but she had a great time just linking the blocks together into various shapes. Warning here! Some of the pieces are very small. If your little one still likes to put things into his or her mouth you will need to be very careful here. Even at 3 year old I will not allow her to play with these unattended. This is definitely a Daddy and Me project at this age! The colors of the blocks are bright and eye catching. You can tell this set was designed with girls in mind and the colors had a strong leaning toward pinks and purples but there was plenty of variety overall.After allowing her to play with random connections for awhile I started building some of the recommended items for her. I should note that this box comes with a nice starter book that included step by step instructions for building a variety of little projects e.g. car, house. It also shows photos to give you additional ideas for building. My three year old was too young to really use this book but she could view the photos and point out what she liked. The first thing I did was to build the included mini figure. This was an immediate hit as my daughter love to play with ""little people"". This kit also included a mini horse which was another immediate hit! While she played with those two items I started to build little items to add to her pretend word. The kit included enough bricks to add a small house a car and some plants to her little world. Yes the kit included some specialty items like a door, windows and wheels. All told we spent a almost two hours playing with this kit. As a parent of a three year old knows this is a pretty amazing amount of time to keep her attention at one place!Final thoughts: We loved this! Event for a child under the recommended age Legos can obviously be great fun. They are a great way to spend quality time with your child. I will be making a habit of this and will slowly add additional Legos to her collection. I'm sure this box was designed by Lego to be a stepping stone into the world of the Lego Friends collection and that's ok. As she gets older I will allow her to pick what she wants. I'm sure daddy will pick up a few items of his own along the way. Can you say Lego Friends meet Lord of the Rings?

However, though their are similarities, it's unique as well.  Every player gets crown, bracelet, and ring at the beginning and you play to win the jewels for them.Play is made by guessing the princess that matches a clue on the card.  Clues are age appropriate (ages 4+), but familiarity with the Disney Princess movies will be necessary.  To confirm a correct answer, you must hold the large crown jewel over the card to reveal the princess's image.  The revealed image is clear but not bold.  I don't think this would be suitable for little ones with any vision issues; they might find it frustrating, as they likely would not be able to see the image.  Parents should plan to play along and be the de-coder for them.Definitely a choking hazard for little ones!

101756,A1H88L8X6HM1BQ,B004VPQEAU,CJ-MO,"[0, 1]","I looked forward to playing this game, but was very disappointed. It sounds fun - each player rolls five dice and adds their roll to the roll of a common die. I thought it would be more like Yahtzee, but it was not nearly as fun as that classic game. The common die gives the chance for each player to double their score, which helps someone come from behind and catch up with the player that is leading. However, when rolling only 5 dice, the odds of getting a decent roll were slim. It was almost impossible to get anything more than a three of a kind, and that was hard to do. This made the game more frustrating than fun.  I've never played the original Farkle, and we had to make some house rules because many portions of the instructions were unclear, which added to my frustration.  The instructions referred to online video directions being available, but I didn't think it was worth having to watch a video to learn to play what should have been a very simple dice game.For those familiar with Farkle, the common die may add an interesting twist, but the bubble-popper and dice risers are unnecessary. The bubble-popper for the common die does not roll the die well and seems like it would break after a few uses. We took the die out and rolled it by hand. This was much easier and kept the game moving more quickly. (On a side note, when we removed the die from the bubble-popper, it looked dirty!) The dice risers are rickety and make the play of the game more confusing. Since you can't combine the numbers you get on individual rolls, it's necessary to keep track of what you got on each roll within a round. It was impossible to do this on the risers, so we just started putting the dice aside from each roll and not using the risers at all.The dice themselves are sturdy, even though the white coloring started coming off the numbers after only a couple of uses. I like that there are four sets in different colors so each player can have their own color. However, the red and orange were too similar in color and it was hard to tell them apart.Overall, I think the dice risers and bubble-popper are flimsy and just a gimmick to make more out of the game than there is. It's not an exciting game and became very boring when it became clear it was too hard to get a decent score from an individual roll.",2.0,"Cheap knock-off of Yahtzee, but not as much fun",1356912000,"12 31, 2012",looked forward playing game disappointed sounds fun player rolls five dice adds roll roll common die thought would like yahtzee nearly fun classic game common die gives chance player double score helps someone come behind catch player leading however rolling dice odds getting decent roll slim almost impossible get anything three kind hard made game frustrating fun ive never played original farkle make house rules many portions instructions unclear added frustration instructions referred online video directions available didnt think worth watch video learn play simple dice gamefor familiar farkle common die may add interesting twist bubblepopper dice risers unnecessary bubblepopper common die roll die well seems like would break uses took die rolled hand much easier kept game moving quickly side note removed die bubblepopper looked dirty dice risers rickety make play game confusing since cant combine numbers get individual rolls necessary keep track got roll within round impossible risers started putting dice aside roll using risers allthe dice sturdy even though white coloring started coming numbers couple uses like four sets different colors player color however red orange similar color hard tell apartoverall think dice risers bubblepopper flimsy gimmick make game exciting game became boring became clear hard get decent score individual roll,0

With various brushes and chalks to a faux buckle in the back, Her purse portrays a cartoon scene of Scaris that is still pretty cool. She came with a black stand but no brush. For her it's no problem since her hair has wretched hair spray in it making the hair stiff. Although this does bother me, it also keeps her curls maintained. Her tail sticks in well in certain positions, but does come out occasionally. I still adore her beauty though. Her glasses are cute but her skirt is a bit short. I make clothes for them so it's not a huge deal but I think that it could be a bit longer for younger children. Her book is a sketchbook.

Then it was sold out...moments later it was back up aaaaand sold out again. I believe this went on a few times. Scalpers had a field day, doubling the price of this sucker off of ebay for it's retooled body and G1 color scheme.  It also made those who had purchased the Classic and Takara versions scream over the 65 dollar price tag it originally had.Well ladies and mostly Gentleman I'm here to tell you, this thing even at a higher price is STILL very much worth having in your collection even at a triple or quad the price. And why? Because it's freaking Unicron!Originally designed by in Transformers Armada, this is the only Unicron toy that was ever successfully released by Hasbro and Takara/TOMY ever. It was once again repainted in time for the Energon line with sad horrible Black and Green colors and hardly ever saw the light of day.After the success of the Classics line and Universe moving in, The Armada paint scheme returned in a Universe/Classics box styling and included a bonus Unicron Head to float around without a stand!Takara later re-released the figure along with Primus/Cybertron in a G1 like color scheme at 200 dollars each!During I believe Botcon 2010, Hasbro announced a G1 correct color scheme and retool of the Unicron figure would be released via Amazon shortly later.Now that we got all that settled let's get down to the toy? The colors are amazing, practically very Generation 1 likeness and will make you stare for hours to no end. However the instructions aren't that great and will take a little research to understand the positioning of his Wings once you get it out of the box. All his accessories are kept in slim box that acts as the back drop for the figure in it's case. Parts included would be 2 sets of wings, his planetary shells, and I believe 6 missiles and Kranix (The last survivor of Linthos, poor guy) minicon.His transformation is insanely simple and if you angle him just right, you'll forget that a large chunk of his internals are showing such as his head and his backside and legs! Yes, he's not completely spherical which is a bummer. It's recommended by Hasbro to have him laying on his flat side, but if you got him angled on a wall, you can have his ring formed wings hold him just right and you'll have a great looking ""stand"".Something I do enjoy about his planetary mode is that his pinchers when pushed together will cause his crap like mouth to close and go ""NOM NOM NOM!"" sfx's not included. That's just a treat to see.Robot mode he's very nicely articulated with ratchet joints and individual moving fingers and thumbs and his right hand is still able to light up but also tinted in a slight frosted like gray to keep in color tone with his left which was not done in any other formats to the best of my knowledge.Another bonus is if you have little RTS or Classic legend figures to have them stand around Unicron as while they wont fit scheme wise to well, they'll just show how massive (And he really is massive!)

96630,A1HO0SKOCPX5OE,B004P98RN4,Brick,"[1, 1]","There must be something about baseplates that the Lego group doesn't like. I mean, there seems to be a lack of them in recents sets that's becoming an all too familiar trend. We saw it first with the King's Castle last year, where plates were preferred instead, and that continued this year with the two Creator homes, Log Cabin and Hillside house which where also the first two Creator homes that came without a baseplate. This set continues that trend - the difference this time however, being that with the previous sets, it didn't really affect the stability of the set. This time, I think that Lego may have erred and got it wrong. The two ""halves"" of this set are connected only by a bridge, and whilst it's not ""flimsy"" per se, it's not exactly stable either, and the addition of a blue baseplate here, not only for stability, but to simulate the ocean, would have been a welcome addition. In saying that, it's not a bad set - it's just that it could have been so much better.Minifigures5 in total - generally a good selection, but nothing remarkable about them. Just your standard Lego city figures. They come with some nice accessories, such as the flippers and tank for the diver, and the windsurfer comes with a newly designed torso but otherwise, it's nothing that will really leave you in awe. Average at best. 7/10BuildThis set is comprised of a lot of large pieces and therefore the build is very simple and straightforward. It's a good set for younger builders, but for more experienced Lego fans, this may be a set to miss if you're looking for a challenge. I found the build a little boring due to the ease of it, although having said that, the target age group on the box does say 5-12, so I can't really complain too much. 7/10DesignA very aesthetically pleasing set. Nice, bright colours and in general, excellent playability. The set comprises of a surf shop on top of which is a caf&eacute; complete with an outdoor dining area. Opposite is the lifeguard tower. The boat/dinghy sits 3 comfortably and also looks good, although to fit it under the bridge may be a little difficult. It will fit, but it's a tight fit! 8/10PricingThe piece to price ratio is pretty bad, but you have to consider that a high percentage of these pieces are large. Still I'd have to say that it's at least 25% overpriced. 6/10ProblemsThis set really needs a baseplate, but it is ok. you can get it for just 15$ on lego stores or lego.com. Without it, it's just not stable enough and the bridge section will bend if you pick it up at only one end. In addition, I felt that some piers should have been added to allow boats to dock. You may also find that the bridge is too low, and that most Lego boats will not fit under it.Overall it's a good fun set for younger builders. For collectors or AFOL, it's probably not a set that you would enjoy given the ease of the construction, nor is it one that will become a ""classic"" in years to come. 7/10.",4.0,LEGO City Harbour Marina 4644,1325289600,"12 31, 2011",must something baseplates lego group doesnt like mean seems lack recents sets thats becoming familiar trend saw first kings castle last year plates preferred instead continued year two creator homes log cabin hillside house also first two creator homes came without baseplate set continues trend difference time however previous sets didnt really affect stability set time think lego may erred got wrong two halves set connected bridge whilst flimsy per se exactly stable either addition blue baseplate stability simulate ocean would welcome addition saying bad set could much betterminifigures total generally good selection nothing remarkable standard lego city figures come nice accessories flippers tank diver windsurfer comes newly designed torso otherwise nothing really leave awe average best buildthis set comprised lot large pieces therefore build simple straightforward good set younger builders experienced lego fans may set miss youre looking challenge found build little boring due ease although said target age group box say cant really complain much designa aesthetically pleasing set nice bright colours general excellent playability set comprises surf shop top cafeacute complete outdoor dining area opposite lifeguard tower boatdinghy sits comfortably also looks good although fit bridge may little difficult fit tight fit pricingthe piece price ratio pretty bad consider high percentage pieces large still id say least overpriced problemsthis set really needs baseplate ok get lego stores legocom without stable enough bridge section bend pick one end addition felt piers added allow boats dock may also find bridge low lego boats fit itoverall good fun set younger builders collectors afol probably set would enjoy given ease construction one become classic years come,1

This puzzle is -NOT- like those.  This one's pieces are plastic, rather precisely formed, and form a sphere instead of a replica.  You can assemble it using the picture on the outside or the numbers on the inside.  In either case, you're likely to end up using the numbers (even if just to `verify') because they are so very handy.As for fun - yup.  It is a nice little puzzle/assembly project.  As with any puzzle, you put it together and then let it sit there for a few days/weeks.  Then you disassemble, re-box, and store.  Actually, this one is nice enough and different enough to get hauled to friends/relatives houses for those holiday type visits.

91873,A1GUX6R8DV3ZLY,B004INDQWY,Lauren A.,"[3, 5]","I bought the Little Tikes Island Adventure water table but returned it because I was not satisfied with it.  That table had weak legs that wouldn't snap in and no drain.  Plus it was missing a little rubber ring for one of the tubes and I wasn't 100% sure that the tubes would not warp over time, as they were hard to connect.I bought the Spiralin Seas table instead.  So far, it's FAR better.  I paid more for it, but the activities are a lot of fun.  My 2 year old loves putting the balls down the chute at the middle and spinning the ferris wheel.  Her boats fit well in this table (unlike the Island Adventure one, with its narrow channels). The balls squirt, which is also a big hit.  It also has a drain spout so it drains easily.  The legs snap in and seem sturdier compared to the Island Adventure table.  I've never left water in overnight as bugs die in the water in the evening and I think the water would just be gross the next day, but the Island Adventure table would start to bow from the weight after a few hours.  That hasn't been a problem with this table.  Also, the table has activities that can entertain a wide range of kids.  In addition to a 2 year old, I also have an almost 6 year old and a 7.5 year old.  The older children - particularly the 5 year old - enjoy playing with this toy as well.  The table isn't too low - the spiral chute is quite tall - so it didn't feel like a baby toy to the big kids.  The 2 year old is obviously entertained by it for more time, but it's good through kindergarten age.Only negative?  When she pours water down the chute in the middle it leaks.  I'm sure that's so water doesn't become all gross in there.  But just wanted to let you guys know that this happens!  Of course, it's an outdoor toy, so that's not a HUGE deal.  It doesn't otherwise leak either.  One more caution - if you add extra toys, make sure they won't get stuck in the chute when experimental children to watch them travel down the chute like the balls do!

But since my daughter loves The Little Mermaid, I figured it was worth a try.As soon as my daughter opened the box, she was in love with the fountain and insisted on taking a bath just to play with it. And when she did, she played with the fountain nonstop. The next morning, I found her playing with it in the living room, and then she asked to take another bath (which is a rarity).In my four-year-old daughter's eyes, this toy gets 5 stars. After all, isn't she the one who's supposed to enjoy it? Isn't she, not the parent, the true judge?Well, that said, I still have my own $0.02 to add. Several people complained about the fountain tipping over and submerging. I found that it floats fine on its own, but when played with and tipped on purpose, it does get waterlogged and sink. For whatever reason, my daughter took that as part of the fun. She simply lifts it out of the water, turns it sideways to let the water spill out, and then sets it back down to float again.What I didn't like is the fountain holes at the top. In the picture, it shows a nice stream of water shooting straight up. In reality, it shoots toward the sides getting water everywhere. The harder the shell is pressed, the farther the water travels. Thankfully, my daughter doesn't press it as hard as I do, but we keep the shower curtain pulled all the same just to be sure the water isn't getting on the bathroom floor.So far, the toy has been a success in my daughter's eyes.

39385,A1J3V4WMVQPYTJ,B000NRVFV8,L. Burbank,"[1, 1]","We purchased this for your 4 yr old and 2 yr old.  I was worried it would be too easy for our 4 yr old since she is great at her basic stuff.  From the moment I opened it the girls both loved it.  My two year old loves it.  She does pretty good for barely turning 2 last month.  My 4 yr old loves it too.  She does great playing it.  She loves the fun house that is on the learning carnival game.  It is similar to a video game that you have to more left, right, up, down, and jumping.  The computer is great for teaching keyboard skills.  It has worked great for reinforcing her abc's and letters.  We purchased an extra game but you don't need to at the beginning.  The games seem to be the next level for the activities on the computer itself that are already included.  Plus there are coupons in with the console to get money off the games.  I did purchased the adapter to avoid large numbers of batteries.  I have only had it a week and so I am not sure on the long term durability yet.  It seems to be great though with a solid keyboard and mouse.  We have not had any issues with the keyboard recognizing anything except my 2 yr old wraps her fingers around the mouse so the mouse is lifted enough off the pad causing it to not always recognize her moving it.  My only complaint is that when you type ""f"" it sounds like the letter name is ""s"".  It makes the correct pronunciation but saying what the letter name is sounds incorrect.

It reminds me of those toys you get from the dollar stores for goody bags - cheap plastic that falls apart very easily. They should really consider lowering the price or re-vamping the quality of the train and making it compatible with the Geotrax. Or better still making it wooden and compatible with this Thomas the train set. Those tend to keep the kids interested.It's really a shame because it is a great show and very educational.My children are 2 and 3 1/2 years old and they played with it for 20 minutes and then it was discarded. It doesn't hold their attention so I returned it.We also purchase the motorized version with tracks from Target for $24.99 which also yielded a lack luster response from the kids.

They like dolls of all types, but due to their obsession with fashion and style, they prefer dolls such as Barbie and they have taken a quick liking to the Barbie Collector Doll. They have added this to their Barbie stockpile and continue to play with it and display it to this day.Barbie Collector Holiday Doll is a glamorous doll that features Barbie in a green and gold gown. Barbie is glamorized further with her make- up and accessories, which include earrings, gold slippers, and other items. She is a sight to behold, and that is why many will likely place this Barbie on display and not do anything else with it. She even comes in her own display box for this very purpose.My girls like the Barbie Collector Holiday Doll, but they don't play with her the way they do other Barbie's and I am pretty sure this is due to the collector nature of this doll. With the flowing gown and accessories, she is more of a display item and even though my girls are too young to consider themselves Barbie collectors (or to even know what that means), they tend to place this Barbie off by herself, on a bedroom shelf, while they play with their more casual Barbie dolls.

You can also seek specific cards that also add victory points by going along with what you're building the most of during the game like tools, food production, buildings, or population.Stone Age already starts out less dry than for example Puerto Rico, and blocking your opponents from doing what they're setup to do can also add a good deal of additional fun to the game.Stone Age is an all-around great complete game and value.",5.0,Stone Age - easy to learn but has strategic complexity,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",stone age relatively rare game easy learn yet strategic complexity multiple paths victory components excellent toothe first priority game make sure people dont starve onceaddressed focus growing population gathering resources buildbuildings also ability build tools add dice rolls discretion gathering resources food something havent seen game like makes sense seems accurately reflect stage human historywhile smart player placement align goals next turn given opponents likely strategic complexity game probably comes mostly cards resources obtaining variety different cards add decent amount total victory points end game also seek specific cards also add victory points going along youre building game like tools food production buildings populationstone age already starts less dry example puerto rico blocking opponents theyre setup also add good deal additional fun gamestone age allaround great complete game value,1

51682,A2NS3IPJV3SRAK,B0017RQYDC,A. Bailey,"[54, 61]","I remembered how much fun CLUE was when I was younger and decided to purchase it for my younger siblings (we often have game nights at my apartment with ages 8-40+). This game is recommended for ages 9+ and 3-6 players (although you could do more if you wanted to do teams).If you are a die-hard CLUE fan you may not like the updates. The most annoying updates (I found) was changing the careers of the characters. I still refer to mustard as ""Col. Mustard"" and ""Mrs. White"" as the maid (who is now a childhood star?"" Personally, it's a bored game and the characters can be whoever you want them to be so it's not that big of deal (this is where the die-hards may not like it.)Game Play:The idea is the same as the original clue. The name of one person, one weapon and one room is put into the yellow confidential pouch and put aside until the end of the game. The rest of the ""rumor"" cards (which list people, weapons, and rooms) are equally handed out to the players. (As a note if we have an unequal amount we have a roll off to see who gets the remaining card (or two) by seeing who can roll doubles first... this is a fair and easy way to get all the cards distributed.)Once you receive your cards you mark off all the cards you have in your hand on the CLUE sheets secretly. You choose which character you want to be. (Choices: Scarlet, Mustard, White, Green, Peacock, and Plum). The character you choose gets a special character card and once per game you can use their ""power"" (example ""get an extra roll of the dice"" or ""move to a room you're not in""...) this is okay, but I personally don't think it adds too much to the game.Some of the weapons have changed and the mansion has been updated. The weapons now are ""bat, pistol, candlestick, knife, robe, axe, dumbbell, poison, and trophy."" While some people hate that the wrench was replaced with a trophy, my (high school aged) sister loves it and has been hoping every game that it would be the murder weapon. (Not yet :))You roll the dice and move the number of spaces until you get into a room. In the room you can start a rumor blaming a person, weapon, and the room you are in. (For example I think Mrs. Scarlet did it, in the Hall, with the Knife.)Everyone else must look at their cards and if they have one of the ones you said show it to you alone. You secretly mark it down on the Clue sheet. The catch is they only show you one. They may have all three or two of them.The addition to the game that we really enjoyed are the intrigue cards. If you roll a ""?"" mark, land on a ""?"" mark, or, if you were moved during your turned (being blamed for a murder) you can choose to pull one. Most of them are positive saying things such as ""the player to your right must show you a card"" or ""you can take another turn, roll again"", 8 of the cards are not. There are 8 clock cards mixed in the pile. The idea is that the murder has not happened yet and you are trying to figure out the case before the host of the party dies (this is different from the first game as the host has a chance of living.)This adds a lot of fun. Once 7 clock cards have been pulled, no one wants to be the person who pulls the 8th clock card and kills the host so it gets interesting! The game rules say if you pull the 8th clock card you are out of the game. We made a house rule and don't follow this (no one likes to sit and watch everyone else play.)When the person thinks they've figured out the mystery they have to move their piece to the pool. This can be interesting itself because someone can move you to a room (during their turn if they blame your character for the murder) and you can have a difficult time getting to the pool. Once in there the person says (for example, ""I think Mr. Plum, in the Spa, with the Poison"")... They then look at the cards in the confidential folder privately. If right they win the game, if wrong they put the cards back in the folder and are ""out"" for the rest of the game.Pros:*The ""Suspicion"" cards with the 8 clock cards add a lot of fun and a little bit of pressure to figure it out more quickly. We really enjoy this aspect of the game.*The updates, for the most part, are pretty cute although most of them don't affect the game play*Same basic premise of the original game*This game seems to never get old and is accepted pretty well by everyoneCons:*Really these are personal quirks but I liked the original names of the characters... We still call him Col. Mustard lol*My sister doesn't like the new game pieces... Instead of pieces that look like the characters, they are plastic question marks in the color of their names (example: Mustard=Yellow). Not terrible, but I guess could be better*Murder is both taken lightly and discussed throughout the game, but that should be a given as it is a CLUE murder game.

Each selects a pyramid color and then attempts to, in turn, get five pyramids of their color to touch either vertically, horizontally or diagonally while the other player attempts to accomplish the same goal while each tries to block the other player&#8217;s plan. If when all pyramids are in play no one has five in a row, each player takes a turn moving an existing piece with the rule that the pyramids still must touch. This continues until someone wins.The premise of the game is straightforward so the instructions are almost unneeded, but they are included on a small folded card and are also available on the manufacturer&#8217;s website. With virtually no learning curve, the play starts immediately and the game does not require a great deal of time to complete. I played the game with another adult and we had fun trying to derail each other&#8217;s pyramid lay-out.  While playing, good humored barbs were freely being tossed back and forth.

The second mode teaches the colors of the keys, and the third mode allows your child to choose an instrument and each key makes a note like that instrument.  Finally the last mode plays songs, one song for each key pressed.The big appeal of this toy, I think, is that when each key is pressed, the corresponding colored ball pops up in the back of the toy.  It's compelling for little ones to watch.The only negative thing I can say is that you have to press pretty hard to get the ball to pop up to the top.

Sets of ""Cars"" Micro Drifters, which are small, plastic, fixed-wheel racers that glide along by means of a steel ball, are available in three-packs; it takes thirteen three-packs to fill this case to capacity when combined with the included WGP Lightning McQueen Micro Drifter. This Fast Flip Carry Case has two tabs on its underside, which act as a mount for the case to be a grandstand attached to theFast Flip Transforming Raceway.This is a substantially sturdy case, considering it is plastic. It locks tight with two tabs that open with the press of an easily accessible button on the front at the lower-right corner, so be careful not to pry to get the box open, otherwise you may break a tab. After pressing the button, the springs fling the top up swiftly, providing access to the lower grandstand ""seating,"" whereas a clear plastic cover keeps the upper grandstand storage compartments enclosed. The clear plastic cover, with some effort, can be lifted up as a canopy over the grandstands. While open, two plastic flags can be stuck into post holes of the upper level, but they look odd being vertical to the upper level which rests at an incline; there is no dedicated storage for the flags, though a few side slots are wide enough to store them, they will move about once the lid is turned down to close the case.When I was young, I loved to apply stickers to new toys, and apparently, I still do. It takes a steady hand to apply the six thin road stripes, one handle banner, two grandstand banners and four play surface backgrounds to get them just right. Once the stickers are in place, there are four plastic, collapsible pop-up facades to attach to the playfield: three buildings with openings large enough for the Micro Drifters to glide through, and a stack of tires, which somewhat resembles a totem pole.The set is for ages four and up, and the cars are a blast to zip around, but I would worry to leave too small of a child to play with the set unattended. The Micro Drifter autos are esophagus-sized, and the flags are tiny too. The whole Micro Drifters concept seems ""geared"" to be a collecting thing, and it is definitely something I would have been into at six to eight or so. Collectible sets are always fun, and Micro Drifters are pretty awesome in that regard.

The Ravensburger ""Krypt"" jigsaw puzzle has only one color -- a matte, metallic silver-gray -- and thus there are no visual cues to help you solve the puzzle other than the shape of each individual piece. This includes the pattern of the puzzle, which begins with a central whirlpool design, radiating outwards to the edges, which have many elongated edge pieces. Towards the center, many pieces have curled, arcing shapes, but gradually this circular pattern evens out, although along the way many ""normal"" jigsaw shapes are incorporated into the central region. Also along the way, many new, unusual shapes are introduced which may throw veteran puzzlers for a loop.There are two ways to tackle this puzzle - the first is to simply try muscling your way through (after meticulously sorting all 654 pieces by shape, of course) Just start somewhere and try out pieces one by one.  Or, you can ""cheat"" and use the small, xeroxed map of the completed puzzle's pattern, which shows the outline of each piece, and how they fit together. I recommend cheating: unless you're a crazy genius savant, just going in blind and trying to do the Krypt like any other puzzle can be very, very frustrating. Even looking at the key, you will learn a lot about doing puzzles and enjoy yourself... and still be quite challenged. This one will really kick your butt.

It's set up in a room that doesn't get much use, so he hasn't played in it very much - and already, in just two months and having been played in only a handful of times, one of the cheap plastic poles has creased just below a joint and collapsed, rendering the whole tent useless. Even before it broke, the poles frequently came out of the too-loose pockets that they're supposed to fit into at the bottom corners of the tent. There's no obvious way to attach the tunnel to the tent, so it just sits in the hole, and falls out frequently because the hole is too big by several inches, and doesn't sit flush with the floor. The only positive is that we haven't (yet) seen the wire come loose from the tunnel as others have.I'd like to contact the manufacturer to ask for replacement poles, but I don't have the packaging anymore and am also wondering if it's a waste of time anyway, because if the replacement poles are the same as the ones that come with the tent, it'll no doubt be broken again in no time.

This particular set, with over 700 pieces, allows for a multitude of building projects.  The 7-year I gave this set to seemed to take to it right away.  The pieces arrive in a nice container that almost looks like a green treasure chest.  The instructions are fairly-straightforward but not easy to follow for the younger builders.  In fact, I had some difficulty following some of the steps given that the directions seem to be aimed at those who have some familiarity with the K-nex building sets.  In addition, some of the pieces are rather small and can be easily lost, which can lead to some frustration when trying to build particular constructions.  After a couple of hours, I fully expected the little one to lose interest but he kept at it.  But he has always had an interest in building things and this was geared toward cultivating that.  Unfortunately, within in a week, he seemed to have lost interest.  He stated that he had difficulty following the instructions and that some of the pieces didn't fit like they were supposed to.  I think 7 years old is a little to young to have developed the patience that these sets require.  While he still plays with it occasionally, the patience involved in creating some of the more complicated sets as shown on the outside of the box are probably better suited for kids 10 and older.

I also bought two extension packs (school and chores) so we have a lot of options to choose from. We use it by picking the areas that need the most work and using those for a number of weeks until those actions are mastered or become routine, whether that's going to bed and staying in bed, brushing teeth, picking up, etc. The best part is it's focused on rewards and positive encouragement, rather than punishing and taking away.The colorful pictures and stick-on stars combined with the reward system keep him engaged. We offer a reward at the end of every week if he meets a certain number of stars, and he does not get a star if something isn't done (this gives him the freedom of choice, while teaching that every choice has a consequence).

100752,A2GHU8I0P3HFRW,B004UC4N1G,"Wandrwoman ""Wise as Aphrodite, Beautiful as A...","[3, 5]","I played regular Scrabble Slam once before with a couple of kids and I found it to be a moderately fast paced and fun card elimination game based on building four letter words. The first player to use up all the dealt cards won. There was moderate skill involved as the best player made the most words and was able to use up the cards first.Scrabble Turbo Slam levels the playing field by introducing the ""Turbo Slam"" unit and ""game changing cards"". To play the game, the ""Turbo Slam"" unit, a battery operated box which makes noise and plays ""music"" is turned on. When a ""turbo"" sound is played, the first player to slap the top of the box gets to draw one of the ""game changing cards"" which instructs the player to pass a number of his letter cards to other players or to take cards from the other players. Generally, the one who hits the top of the ""Turbo Slam"" unit the most often gets to pass the most cards and thus win the game. To a kid, this is an extremely advantageous feature as speed can trump skill. Additionally, there is communal slapping (albeit of the top of a black box) that is not only encouraged, but required.Should adults play this game without kids? Probably not. I played this game with my husband the Sultan of Scrabble on a rainy Sunday and the results were not as fun as should be. First of all, making four letter words quickly is fun but only for a short amount of time. ""Game...Tame...Lame...Lane...Yawn"" Then there is the noise and the ""music"" part of the noise. We had some trouble recognizing the ""Turbo Sounds"" from the rest of the cacophony. One game, my husband kept his hand on top of the box and slapped away at any sound. He won quickly and handily. The next game, I threatened to hit him with the box. I won quickly and handily. There was no alcohol involved, however, I think it would greatly improve the game should adults play without kids.Some details:-Requires three AAA batteries, not included-Battery compartment access requires small Philips screwdriver-Although the game box is approximately 10 1/2"" square, the actual game inside is only the 8"" x 4"" ""Turbo Slam"" unit-The cards and the instructions are housed in a drawer in the ""Turbo Slam"" unit",3.0,Fast Paced and Noisy with Slapping .....Kid Heaven?

We also received one year of online access for each pet.  This year, they requested and received the new Littlest Pet Shop LPSOs.  I purchased 2 pets and attempted to set up their online access today.  I noticed the LPSO pet uses a different web site than the VIP pets.  Well, turns out the LPSO pet is only good for a 30-day trial of online access.  If you want another 30 days, it'll cost nearly $7.  And an entire year, (which you get automatically with webkinz), is FIFTY-SEVEN DOLLARS!!! I thought I was seeing things.  My immediate reaction was to pack both dolls back up and exchange them for Webkinz.  My daughters already received four Webkinz for Christmas and they really liked their LPSOs and wanted to keep them.  My older daughter asked if she could use some of her Christmas money to pay for a subscription.  I told her to try the trial first and see if it's worth the $57.  So far, they appear to enjoy the online play, but I'm pretty peeved that the toy was so misleading.  Nowhere on the box does it indicate that the online play is trial only, unless you pay additional money.  Also, you do not get an online counterpart of the pet you purchase.  Once enrolled, you create a totally new pet.  That makes me wonder why they're even selling the stuffed versions at all.  Just more money down the drain, unless you specifically bought it for the stuffed animal only.  Given that these things are marketed as ""online"", it seems very misleading.  One last gripe, trying to find and connect to the same servers is an exercise in futility.  My girls tried to find each other in their virtual worlds.  However, all of the servers have ""0"" for the number of online players and my girls get different lists of servers when they log on at the same time using different computers.

The pieces are made out of a vinyl like material, so they are very soft and will cling to other surfaces as well.We found that 5 to 8 year olds really enjoyed these and even kids up to 12 or so showed some interest, which was a surprise to us as the older kids are mostly into electronic games. The best reactions always come from the adults who see these and almost always say, ""Oh, I remember those""The pieces are durable, colorful, and stick just fine to the included boards and each other. This allows for the creation of almost any shapes and patterns. It is important to make sure the pieces are returned back to their original sheets when kids are done playing with them to keep them from getting bent or lost and the spiral bound book makes this convenient.This toy brings out the creative side of children and most will have hours of fun creating abstract works of art.

Krillin has great attention to detail and looks like he jumped right out of the Anime. The assortment of faces they provide really gives all the emotions/expression you would want from a Krillin figure. You can pose him in nearly every way possible and he is pretty durable too, joints are all sturdy and parts do not fall off.I do have to say though that Krillin is not my favorite in this lineup. His design, (while absolutely great and everything that you want) is kind of as expected - if you have any other figures in this lineup. That isn't necessarily a bad thing though because this lineup is great. However, when I pulled him out he does not seem to have that WOW factor that some of the other characters have had (Frieza, Cell, Vegeta).Also to note the destructo disk that comes with him seems very fragile. I would recommend that you take extreme care with it. It looks cool but I question its durability. The best attack effect that I have seen from this line comes from Cell's Kamehameha...which just looks great and of course can be used for other figures as well, such as Goku.If you are a fan of Krillin buy this, if you are collecting the line buy this, but if you are on the fence and only buying a few of these figures I wouldn't make Krillin a priority.For this reason I am giving him a 4 out of 5.

She was much more interested in Clawdeen's outfit.The howling feature is really the only thing that sets this figure apart from the original.  The outfit is very similar to the original Clawdeen outfit, as is her makeup, hair, etc.One thing I do want to mention is the fact that the limbs are easy to pop off.  I have read many reviews of multiple Monster High dolls that complain about this particular aspect of the doll, but it is intentional.  You can easily remove the limbs so that you can change the outfits on the characters and/or swap body parts.

First, you choose a mission from the game manual, then based on that mission you make a map with the tiles they provide you. There are six survivors with this game so if there are six people, each person chooses a survivor. Each survivor starts off with a special ability. One gets a gun, another one can escape zombies with no extra actions, another gets an extra move action, etc.The mission we played, involved us trying to find food, and escape with at least one survivor. The fun part about this game is that every one discusses what actions they should take. This is big, because after each player goes, then the zombies gets to go. Another cool thing is that there are four different zombies. If you are a zombie fan like I am than you will recognize which movies match which zombie.

The shipping was EXCELLENT I ordered him Monday evening and he came on thursday. Just in time for Valentines Day!!! Well as usual  . . . paint. One thing you'll notice unless your blind or color blind is that he is red all over!!! His armor is a nice thick red with some black smudges for weathering. And on his mask he has a really cool looking design. Its like black streaks with two yellow dots on the center of his forehead. They also added a unique-looking loin cloth, it is red with little silver studs on it. They even put the buckle in the back! Another thing people might notice is that the wrist blades are gold, but they dont stay retracted very good. And on the Gauntlets they added some silver to the tubes on the sides of them. And one more thing to mention in paint is the fact that they gave him ""Brighter flesh tones"" as indicated on the back of his package. Next is sculpt. Theres alot of Classic predator here, pretty much classic besides the new loin cloth and improved articulation. But there are some minor differences. First one is the forearms are switched out, so the blades are on the left and the gauntlet is onthe right. Second is the bone necklace has only four bones. And third, the masks yellow bumps are actually bumps, and the mask is not sculpted to the head. Last but not least . . . Accesories.

Of course my 4 year old thinks the object of the game is to get the pirate to shoot out so that's always our goal.  The plastic that the knives are made out of are decent and have some flex to them to wiggle them into the slots (which occassionally you do have to tweak it just right), the plastic that the barrel is made out of is a bit cheap.  The spring that causes the pirate to shoot out is decent and so the pirate gets decent height (see the picture album for an example.)The biggest complaint that I am seeing in the lesser starred reviews is that the spot to eject the pirate is always the same.  THIS IS USER ERROR and not the fault of the game.  The way that you randomize the pop up spot is with the pressure peg that the pirate ultimately rests on.  Before you push it down to reset it - you simply twist it this causes the location of the ""the spot"" to change.My son plays this over and over and OVER again.  He's made that pirate pop up at least 100 times.  There have been about 5 times in that 100 that he gets all the knives in and the pirate didn't pop.  So it's not 100% accurate, but for less than 10% error on the part of the popping pirate there is no fun lossed.

Frodo carries the sword Sting, and he and Samwise both have their concealing capes. The only poor aspect to this in my opinion is Gollum.

Already adept with an iPad, my 2-year-old daughter had no trouble learning how to use the LeapFrog Touch Magic Bus.  She particularly likes to listen to the songs and play with the piano keys.  Ingeniously, when the songs are playing, all of the piano keys are keyed to make sounds from the same chord family as the song that is playing, so the piano sounds actually complement the song being played and do not create any dissonances.  This makes my 2-year-old feel like she's actually contributing to the song, and that's fun for her.  My only complaint is that I would love for this toy to have more songs (there are only three songs).As for the letters, it is nice to have a toy that has good sound quality and that enunciates the letters (and the sounds for each letter) well.  This is particularly important for young children who are still learning to speak.  My daughter doesn't have as much fun with the letters as with the songs, but I think she is learning from this aspect of the toy.Finally, there is a game mode that says things like, ""Find the letter K.""

It was fun to watch snippets of the movies, especially ones we haven't seen forever, and remember just how excellent many of them are.We really only had two complaints: First, the ""Tiebreaker"" questions are pretty lame, at least from an adult's perspective.  Tiebreakers were ""solved"" by the game telling us things like the ""person with the next birthday"" won the tie.  That's not a tiebreaker, that's just a fancy coin toss.  Our second complaint was that if we had missed ANY of the Disney movies, we absolutely had no chance on some questions.  I'm not sure how popular ""Meet the Robinsons"" was in the theater, but we missed it.  We ended up bumbling our way through about half a dozen trivia questions just on that one movie.

74127,A1RKCT4H3X3J1W,B00388J1UQ,Grandma Zizzy,"[4, 4]","Based on the 2010 Misty Island Rescue movie, this playset - with one side being Misty Island (with a brown track) and the other side being Sodor (with a silver track) is a VERY elaborate Take-n-Play set, with FOUR separate places to connect up with other playsets or additional track!  Hard to begin to describe everything... the Sodor side has a few (painted on) buildings from the Sodor Search & Rescue Centre (you can see the tiny SSRC emblems) that is being constructed from the special Misty Island Jobi wood, and a lift of a lever opens a boarded up hidden passageway that Thomas (included!) can take into the Misty Island side, which has REALLY cool features!  Large Jobi trees are the backdrop to two ground level track loops, and another bending piece of track precariously towers above them!  There is also a swiveling logging crane with a knob to turn that allows the crane's big red (magnitized) hook to lift a couple of heavy (magnetized) Jobi logs up and out of the way for Thomas to explore all of the nooks and crannies in this set!  When Thomas is placed at the top of the set, another lever causes the ""Shake-Shake Bridge"" to actually SHAKE, which propels Thomas down a steep incline, where he bursts through a tunnel and back into Sodor!  It really is difficult to describe all of the intricate details included in this amazing set.  Rescue from Misty Island first appeared on the ""final"" 2010 Take-n-Play Collector Checklist, and we paid $34.99 for our grandson's.  (Update:  Fisher-Price's summer 2013 MSRP is $40.)The only thing I'd caution is that if you want a set your youngster can EASILY and QUICKLY take on the road with you, you might want to consider one of the $30 & under MSRP playsets instead.  Update:  There are 11 TnP sets as of summer 2013 that are what I've come to categorize as ""elaborate"", with MSRPs of $35 & up, and they are (in order of introduction):  Rescue from Misty Island, Rock Quarry Run, Load & Go, Rumbling Gold Mine Run, Thomas at Pirate's Cove, The Dieselworks, The Great Quarry Climb, Thomas at the Ironworks, Thomas' Adventure Castle, Slate Loading Station and Lion Canyon... I wouldn't recommend them for easy transport.  Those are the only ones that Grandma says have to stay put in the basement - they're great if you plan to keep them set up at home!A little of our own personal ""Thomas"" history... As first time grandparents, my husband and I wanted to start some type of collection for our grandson that he could possibly pass along to his own kids one day.  Our grandson was 2 1/2 at the time, and had been talking a lot about a certain train named Thomas (a little fella whom - now seems hard to believe! - we'd never heard of.)  After doing some research, it seemed the Take-n-Play line might be the perfect investment to engage and encourage his active imagination, as well as provide a fun way for us to interact with him.  What a rewarding decision... we've had SO much fun together with this quality line of trains, vehicles and playsets!

All six of us (parents, kids from 6 to 13) can play at once.  The game is easy to learn and easy to teach to kids that are visiting for the day.  Plus, kids get practice in math.In Zeus on the Loose, you try to be the player holding the funny yellow plastic Zeus figure (our Zeus' lightning bolt broke on about the 10th game, hence the lower durability rating) when the hand ends.  Each player is trying to spell ""ZEUS"" and each won hand earns another letter.  So, winning four hands wins the game.All players have four cards: some are number cards some are god/goddess cards that have special actions.  Players take turns putting cards on the pile in the center of the table, announcing the pile's total.  If a player plays certain god/goddess cards (they all have their special actions written on the cards, so you don't have to memorize the actions), he gets Zeus.  If a player is able to play the same card and ""steal the play"" (ie. put a 7 on top of a 7 just played), or if the player raises the total of the pile to a multiple of 10 (10,20,30, etc.) then he gets to hold Zeus.  When the pile reaches 100 or above, or when the pile of cards runs out, the hand is over.Before you buy it online, see if you can find it in your Walmart or Target for about $5.

Saichania was a heavily Armored dinosaur who had plating on its legs. One casual glance at the model shows that there is no armor on the legs. The other Scientific flaw with this figure, is simply that the  clubbed tail is too short, and doesn't look like it can deliver a powerful enough blow to a hungry predator.The figure is painted in a beautiful blue and yellow coloring, which makes me think of a Blueberry glaze over a piece of Carmel.

So what does KRE-O do to make your child instantly happy? They throw in FIVE tiny 5+ piece robots that kids can assemble and play with right away. So while the adult is grappling with the directions, your child is contentedly playing with these super cool mini-robots. The mini-robots were about the size of the LEGO people, and very creative looking, some with capes, etc.Putting the truck together was something my husband and son worked on. It literally took hours. My son loved spending that much time with his dad building such a cool truck. The final product was this amazing looking truck that was great for my 5-year-old to play with. He was so impressed by it's majesty. However, it DOES come apart after some play. (To the dismay of the person who worked so hard to assemble it!)The overall product is pretty impressive, but getting there takes lots of work. KRE-O needs to mimic LEGO a little more with coordinated numbered bags & building instructions; my husband said the bags of pieces weren't separated with any rhyme or reason. I know from experience with building some large LEGO structures that the numbered bags were a very good thing, so I understand the added frustration for users.Comparing them directly with LEGO pieces, they seem to hold together a little better (tighter) than LEGO. The pieces are compatable with LEGO pieces, so it will enhance any existing sets. We have yet to integrate them because we haven't built Optimus Prime yet. Once we mix them up, it'll probably be hard to figure out which is which.These brand is not as slick as LEGO because of the difficulty assembing the featured end products with the manufacturers directions.

Ours is perfectly made, so no worries there.  I like this stacker for my 16 month old son for a number of reasons.  The post is the same diameter all the way down, so the rings can go on in any order now when he is first learning to stack.  But for later, the angle of the rings is pretty gradual, so when he's able to start determining the right order it will be a little bit of a challenge.  And classic wood toys are just nice in every way-- versatile, and nice to touch, hear and look at.I wouldn't buy this for a sitting/crawling baby, and I would definitely not leave it on the floor near a new walker.  The post seems too poke-y to be near a child who isn't steady with his body.  Even with my son, who's secure on his feet now, it's a table toy.

My 5-year-old son runs around the mat as the computer voice says the equation and then he quickly runs to step on the answer.  The mat has three games (number identification and sequence, addition, and subtraction) and two levels of play.  Regarding addition and subtraction, the first level requires you to find the sum or the difference and the second level gives you the answer to the problem and the first number in the equation and you provide the missing number.
