0,1,"This is just as I expected. It's not too sturdy but it stands up well. I'm not sure how long it will last, but my grandsons love plalying with it."
0,1,"Very nice for time destraction. Bought for my 14 year old niece. Although she would rather have a controller or keyboard in her hand, I at times I give her this for a &#34;technology break&#34;!"
0,1,"The art is nice in this coloring book. But I find some of the pages to be boring and repetitive. Thin pages mean you cannot use markers, which is a bummer."
0,1,"All 3 of my kids love these books! They carry them every where and they keep them entertained for hours! Even my 3 1/2 year old will sit and move the stickers around, add more stickers and is happy as a clam! The books are of amazing quality, stickers can be pulled off, moved around and stacked with not damage to the stickers. The stickers that you can order from the website are the best. You cannot buy anything like them. My kids love the foods that you can stack and make hamburgers etc. Stickers have become the best incentive for my kids. They love to earn and trade for new stickers. These books make a great birthday gift, party favor and holiday present."
0,1,"I am so delighted with these flashcards. I actually ordered the 'My first words' version of these and liked them so much I went back and ordered these. I had not heard of the mudpuppy brand before, but I'm looking into see what other products they make. My son is 16 months old, so these are a great toy to help him start to point out animals and make noises, as well as to learn his ABCs.  (The only watch out is that some of the animals I could not think what noises they make!) It is fun for us to go through the ring together or they are easy enough for him to manipulate that he can entertain himself by using them on his own. Given his age, a lot of things still end up in his mouth, including these cards. They have held up very well and aren't completely destroyed! The designs are very cute and this is something that I can see us getting a lot of use out of for the next year or two.  I liked them so much, I ordered another ring for an upcoming trip---they seem like a great plane ride activity.Also, I would highly recommend getting theSecure-A-Toy, BLACK-WHITEto go with this. I used this to strap the rings to the carseat and the stroller, so he can thumb through the cards on his own, but not lose them if he decides to throw them. If you have not used these in general, I highly suggest, as I've found a ton of uses over the last few weeks...they're especially great when traveling."
0,1,"This product has lovely drawings and clear ABC's, but it is not for a baby that is still teething. My 18 month old had this chewed up in minutes. The card board the drawing are on are not as strong as board book weight."
0,1,The size of this puzzle is perfect for my 3 yr old.  Also the I love how sturdy and durable the pieces are.  Would recommend this company for puzzles for kids.
1,0,"This looks like it will be a fun puzzle for my grandson.  Nice size pieces, should be fun to make on the kitchen floor."
0,1,"A very cute puzzle. Nice that it comes in a top-loading box that's big enough to put pieces in edge-wise. Box is big enough that even smaller kids can put it away after putting it together.Puzzle has very large pieces that are easy for little hands to grasp.It's still the same fiberboard stuff that most puzzles are made of, which can be easily damaged, which would be my only complaint for small children (wood is far more sturdy, so I knocked off a star for that.)Still a very cute puzzle for the little ones they'll want to do over & over. Edges get worn a little bit on the corners, but other than that, it's beautiful & easy to put away. Box even has a handle so they can put it away all by themselves."
0,1,"We've picked up Melissa and Doug, Ravensburger, and now Mudpuppy floor puzzles for our daughter.  I like all of them, and they each have good points and not so good points, but the wonderful thing about the Mudpuppy puzzle is it's in a box with a handle, so that she can carry it around.  We love involved activities that travel well, and this is a good choice for a puzzle-crazy toddler.  The picture is bright and has clearly-drawn animals that she enjoys, and the pieces fit well together, but not as well as the Ravensburger or even the Melissa and Doug.  The carrying-case cancels that out, in my opinion, because it's a great grab-and-go item for a trip."
0,1,I have reviewed Ravensburger puzzles in the past and this puzzle seem even more high quality.My nephew loves these at the time of this writing he's only 2 1/2 years old but he still combating these puzzles out and I think this is great for his abilities to problem solve in the future. So it says 3+ on the box but my nephews of building them since he was just over two.The pieces are high-quality made from sturdy cardboard and there's deftly no choking hazard as they are really extra large pieces. And the prices really decent nice puzzle for 15 bucks (at the time of writing this review). Another thing I like about this is the back of the puzzle is a white surface so after they've done this puzzle for a while and maybe are getting bored with it you can put together white side up and then draw together on it and then let the child put that puzzle that they made together just an idea but deftly could be fun for the whole family. You could even draw a map to their birthday or Christmas presents on the puzzle pieces that have them find the puzzle pieces to build the map find where their presence are located (that which is me brainstorming out but that would be fun also)Here's a few things that you can do to introduce the puzzle and get more out of it. I think putting it together 1st so the child gets the picture and then start disassembling it a piece of the time will help engage even young children and helping them to get the concepts of puzzles. another thing you could do is put the puzzle together upside down have them flip each piece over and then start putting each piece they flip over together again another little way to help them get engaged and understand the concepts of puzzles.To me I personally feel that helping children understand puzzles and how to put pieces together is one of the best early learning tools you can offer them.
0,1,"We love this floor puzzle. My toddler loves the animals and has fun naming them all as we put it together. At 27 months he can't quite do it by his self, but enjoys it with Mommy's help and is starting to be able to get some of the pieces together. He also loves the box (don't they all?) and likes the string handle that he can carry it with.The pieces are large and just right for toddler hands. It is fairly sturdy. We haven't had any trouble with bent pieces, but the picture is being to peel on a few of them.Overall, this is a very nice floor puzzle for toddlers/preschoolers."
0,1,"I had a lot of fun putting this puzzle together.  I confess that I used the picture on the box once or twice.  The pieces (25) are big, colorful, and well made, and the box states that the puzzle greyboard and the packaging contain recycled paper, and it's printed with nontoxic, soy-based inks.  (I checked for that.)  However, I wanted to get another opinion--one from the target group, so I offered it to a neighbor so her children could test it.  Here's her report:""Della Kate (6) and Hardy (4) both enjoyed it very much.  For Della Kate it was very easy and for Hardy it was a bit more challenging but he could still complete it independently in a matter of minutes.  Both returned several times to the puzzle without my suggestion.""Sounds like a great gift for a kid, and it's educational with all the zoo animals.  You can teach them about seals, koalas, pandas, and the rest of the animals and birds and visitors.  The koala mother and baby are really cute, btw.Note: Designed in the U.S.A., but manufactured in China."
0,1,"My kids are 4 and 6 and they just love puzzles, so when that Amazon box arrived my kids jumped with joy!The pieces are big and bright and great for hand and eye coordination. Its enough pieces to make them slow down and think, but not so many that they become overwhelmed and frustrated.Overall it is a great puzzle I highly recommend it!"
1,0,"This puzzle is full of cute animal illustrations, ranging from penguins to elephants to monkeys and peacocks.  The colors really pop to attract young children's eyes.  The large pieces are easy for small hands to put together, or take apart."
0,1,"These letters are great for teaching children finger tracing. They were smaller than what I wanted but ended up being perfect.  You can use them in many ways that will work for teaching your kids sounds and letters.  The applications are endless!  Plus, I thought the letter shapes fit well with the Handwriting Without Tears program my son's school teaches from."
0,1,"My children enjoyed tracing the letters at 3-1/2 to 4 years of age.  At 4-1/2, they have moved on, so I got about 6-9 monhts of use out of these.  The cards are high-quality, made on card stock with sandpaper-like material where the letters are.  I would hold their fingers and trace along the letters the first few times, then they took over on their own after that.  Using the cards was a good foundation to help them learn to write their letters later."
0,1,These are great tactile letters for learning the alphabet. They are made out of cardstock so they bend very easily. These are good for mommy and me learning time not independent play. You cannot beat the price on these... The school supply store was charging $10 for just the uppercase letters.
0,1,"I grew up playing Monopoly.  Lots of people did.  It's unfortunate, because there was this gem just sitting there, begging to be played, but passed over.  Here's what was missed:THEMEThe game is about buying and selling stock in hotel chains, causing chains to merge, and go in and out of business.  Given that virtually NONE of this is represented visually and it looks more like a Bingo board, the theme really stands out.  You really feel like you're doing exactly what the game says you are.COMPONENTSThis is where the game takes a hit.  If you can, see if you can pick up one of the versions from the 1960's or 1970's.  Those were VERY well made and, as long as you don't need them to be in perfect shape, can be come across for very little.  If you can get one of those, the components are perfectly good.GAMEPLAYYou have a handful of tiles marked like a bingo board and one central &#34;bingo board.&#34;  Every turn, you play a tile to the corresponding spot on the board.  If it is adjacent to another tile that isn't already a company, you get to start a new company.  If it's adjacent to another company, that company just grows.  If it's on its' own, nothing happens.  You can then buy some stock in companies which exist, draw back up to a full hand of tiles, and turn progresses.SOUNDS BASIC, WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL?Glad you asked.  There's a few twists:1) There's a chart which shows the value of a company and the price of its' stock.  The more tiles a company is, the more it's worth, and the more it costs to buy stock.  So, you want to invest more in a company, but also want to grow it?  You either need to wait until next turn to grow it (during which, everyone else gets a shot at it) or you need to grow it now and pay more.2) When 2 companies' tiles touch, they merge.  Having the most (and 2nd most) stock gets you cash bonuses, and then you can keep the stock for the company (as it might open back up) or trade it in for money or other stock.  Being in the right spot to take advantage of those is a HUGE component to the game.3) After a company gets so large, it becomes &#34;safe&#34; in that it can't be bought out anymore.  Getting in on the stock of safe companies is huge, because those companies just keep growing and growing, getting more and more valuable.SO WHY SHOULD I PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF MONOPOLYA few reasons:1) There's a fairly small rule set, so anyone old and smart enough to pick up on strategy for Monopoly can pick this up.2) It teaches the same principles of investing in the right things at the right time.  Only unlike Monopoly, you don't have so much money that you can just buy everything.  You need to make a choice of what and when to buy.3) There's still an amount of randomness, and you might have things to do even when it's not your turn.4) It's a MUCH shorter game.  The game ends when either one company grows too far or every company on the board is &#34;safe.&#34;  Generally, this is about 45 mins or so, unlike Monopoly, which can last 2-3 hours.5) For kids, it is a much better teaching tool.  It can still teach addition/subtraction just as well, only now it can teach multiplication (&#34;I'm selling 5 shares for 300 a share, how much is that?&#34;), and chance in investments (every investment isn't always a good one).6) There's no electronic version with a debit card.FINAL THOUGHTSAcquire is a very good, fairly short, light-medium weight game.  It's good for a wide range of ages and, especially compared to it's age and what other board games were at the time, it's incredibly well-designed and strategic."
0,1,"I just got this and played it a few times solo. If you are looking for good games to play when there isn't anyone to play with, this is a great one. My current favorite solo game is Arkham Horror and this game is almost as good.The gameplay involves creating a random dungeon from a large selection of heavy interlocking cardboard tiles. You need a good size table. Your band of up to 5 heroes co-operate to explore the dungeon on a set quest adventure. 13 are included in the adventure booklet. After a few games making up your own quest won't be too hard. The dungeon is created as you go so the layout will be different every time you play. The rules are fairly simple and should be easily picked up by even young kids.A nice selection of miniatures in different colors for all the heroes and monsters are included. Each of the adventures requires different unique items, monsters, tokens or cards that are all provided giving the game a large selection of props to create adventures. The card selection is good, I used about half the decks during the first couple of adventures.Everything in the game is well made except the cards. The edges of these were roughed up after the first game. They are cheap cardboard stock and not as well made as what most other game manufacturers use which are more like playing cards.Bottom line: great single or multi-player co-operative board game with good replay value for 1 to 5 players"
0,1,"I love D&D Ravenloft.  My favorite character was Lord Soth, the Knight of the Black Rose.  Well, he isn't in this game.  It's a different story.  Many other reviews already posted most key features and fun of this game.  The key point for me to say being many years D&D player, I still want to join the group, but time is the key concern after getting old with busy job.  This is the one of the good solution for me to enjoy quick D&D.  It combines both D&D RPG and D&D Miniature games with simple character and monster card plus miniatures and you can play as 1 player up to 5 players.  Yes, 1 players.  That's the key for me to join the advanture alone or in group with different fun and good time.  Nice game."
1,0,"This game improves upon its predecessors (Ravenloft and Ashardalon games) by adding the stance mechanic, competitive cooperative team or player vs player scenarios. It does remove the campaign mode but there is plenty of official and unofficial content online as well as the ability to create your own adventure.Those familiar with the Drizzt books will recognize some of the scenario stories in the game but it is not necessary to know the story to enjoy this game. Definitely recommend if you enjoyed the previous games or just want to try the D&D; board games for the first time. There is a mix of luck (random card draws, tile draws, and dice rolls) but there is also a bit of tactical and teamwork play to help balance it out as well."
0,1,"Great game, though it is a bit on the easy side compared to Ashardalon and Ravenloft.  The lack of a healer archetype is a bit of a let down, but characters are interesting otherwise."
1,0,"I bought this for my nephew last year. He had met R.A. Salvatore at a book signing. This game has many cool pieces and a great theme. These boxed board games are much more fun than paper and pencil RPG's because of the wonderful visual aspect of the board and pieces. The Legend of Drizzt Board Game is a great, fun game. My nephew likes it a lot!"
0,1,"I picked this up as a Christmas gift for a friend.  The game is fantastic!  It is THE game everyone wants to play when we get together.  He even picked up the Skullport expansion for it and have had a blast.  The game can be somewhat complicated at first, but once you have a chance to play a few rounds, it opens up into a very nice strategy game."
0,1,Amazingly fun game.  Wotc products can be hit or miss sometimes with me and buddies but this hit the nail on the head for fun.  Can't wait for. Expansions.
0,1,"LoW is probably the most complicated ""euro-style"" game I've ever played, but it's also one of the most fun, and one of the most replayable.  The setup of the game takes around 10 minutes alone.  Play takes roughly an hour, give or take a little depending on the familiarity of the players.I won't go into how to play, as it's a fairly complicated game.  Suffice to say that you have only a handful of actions per turn, but copious amounts of choices to make per turn.  Do I try to acquire adventurers so I can complete quests?  Do I play Intrigue cards to derail my opponents?  Do I try to claim the First Player marker so that I go first next round?  Do I build a building and hope to cash in on other players using it?  Do I claim more quests?  Lots and lots of choices, but limited resources to execute them.Strategy in the game revolves around doing quests.  Your ""Lord"" (randomly chosen at the start of the game) determines which types of quests give you bonus points at the end of the game.  However, because the quests available are randomly determined as the game progresses, it's often difficult to capitalize on this bonus.  Since the quests vary greatly in the resources required to complete them, you end up spending your turns debating whether to acquire resources, play (or gather) Intrigue cards to either hinder your opponents or gain resources yourself, or set up plays for future turns.  Generally, the more resources a quest requires, the bigger the payout.  Though the big reward quests are tempting, it's often better to complete multiple smaller quests of your lord's speciality to acquire the bonus points.  You also have to plan ahead to ensure that you're not found wanting a specific adventurerer type or gold in order to complete a quest.I still haven't completely identified a routinely successful strategy to playing the game, though playing at least one agent into Waterdeep Harbor seems to be effective, if you don't require much resources for quests.  The Harbor allows you to not only play an Intrigue card, but also to redeploy your agent at the end of the round.  With good planning, you can play your card AND get the resources that you need.  Too many Intrigue cards end up wasting your time, however, as you won't gain as many resources from playing them as you will get from buildings on the board.  I could go on for pages about various strategies, but ultimately you have to play the game for yourself to determine what works for that particular game.Production quality is very good for the game.  All pieces are either ~2mm thick plastic-coated cardboard or wood.  The Quest and Intrigue cards are plastic-coated as well, much like good playing cards.  Most impressive to me is that the game box contains an insert which neatly stores all of the pieces in various wells dedicated to those pieces.  This allows you to quickly distribute materials and set up the game without having to dig around the box and sort all of the little tokens.  It also makes the box ""tip-resistant"", where flipping it upside-down won't cause all the pieces to go flying around the box.  Granted, some will lose their places, but they're easily retrieved.  My major complaint is with the victory-point tokens and the 1 gold piece markers.  They take some doing to get them to fit in their assigned spots in the insert, but I don't really know how one would improve upon the design to ease the problem.Overall, this isn't a quick or simple game.  It requires some time dedicated to setting up and playing it, and requires a fair amount of thinking and strategizing to play well.  It is absolutely worth getting and playing though.  The replay value of the game is tremendous and the quality of the product will keep it in good playing shape for many games to come."
0,1,"Like other worker replacement games, the challenge lies in there being limited slots where workers can go. If you need to recruit Fighters and another player before you in terms of turn order does that same thing, then you may not get a chance to do so unless you try something else. And you place your workers one at a time - thus it becomes a question of which move is most important - what is your priority and what can you risk someone else taking instead of you? And so even with so limited moves, the game can be pretty compelling.What helps the game feel distinct are Intrigue cards that can only be played when you put a worker at Waterdeep Harbor. Intrigue cards have some pretty diverse effects including recruiting adventurers or forcing other players to give up some of theirs. Or you can allow an already assigned worker to perform a second job in the same turn. But again there are limited slots at Waterdeep Harbor - and every worker placed there means one you couldn't use to draw a new quest or gather more adventurers.The game is brilliantly designed and fairly well-balanced. The random draw of a Lord of Waterdeep that may potentially influence the types of quests you try to take will indeed steer your game play in different ways and helps make each game unique. And even with a mere 8 turns, games with greater numbers of players can last for a fair amount of time and yet will always feel pretty intense. And of course the Forgotten Realms setting adds some nice flavor to the whole experience.Also, the game as one of the best box designs I've seen in a while - even better than Takenoko. They really thought about ease of storing pieces and ease of deploying them again for a new game. The game board fits snugly into the plastic tray in order to better secure all the loose pieces (and those are a lot of wooden workers and different colors of blocks representing the different adventurers), and I really appreciate the fact that they took the time and effort to design the box in this way.Lords of Waterdeep is a great addition to any game collection and nice twist on the worker-replacement game genre. And yes, you don't need to know anything about Forgotten Realms or Dungeons and Dragons to enjoy the game, as I've clearly demonstrated."
0,1,"The quality of the pieces is really nice.But there is little interaction between the players and there isn't any rhyme or reason to the difficulties of the monsters and no way to improve your characters.  So if you are just interested in a luck-fest, this is the game for you."
0,1,"Many hours of fun for several different ages and grownups, too.  Shared and enjoyed by many.  My husband and I got it for a Christmas present for the 12-year-old grandson."
0,1,9 year old loves this!!!  Instructions included to create books online too.
0,1,I can't wait to read how our adopt a special needs family through Adam's Christmas Joy is going to write their story. This came  and I actually wanted it for myself. I am going to order one for our family. MORE than I excepted. .
0,1,"On our second one, that is how much fun kids who love to write have with this.  Give it a try."
0,1,"This was a gift to my grandchildren and theyloved,loved, loved this so much that theyare all gone. What a way to go to have somethingthat teaches the hands to create"
0,1,"Ticket to Ride is easy to learn, fairly quick to play.  It is a great gateway game from traditional American games into the (to me) more fun world of Euro games."
0,1,My friends and I absolutely love this game!It is quite fun and very entertaining.I enjoy playing this with about 4 people total.Anymore and things get a little messy.I like this game too because it doesn't take a very long time. It runs about 45 minutes.
0,1,"Everyone in our family enjoys this - aged 9 through teen years and to the adults.  What we love is how we can play together in competition while also working on individual goals.  Each player has to try to gather enough of the right colored cards to make train route connection across North America,earning points as your train route grows in length.  Players try to block each other.  Strategy can be simple for the younger kids or more complex for the adults.  It is best played with 3 or more.  I like most that 5 can play easily."
0,1,"I bought this for me and my husband. We love to play, I just wish the game lasted longer between two people."
0,1,"This game will provide hours of fun. There is mild strategy involved, but not too complicated for your casual gamer. This is a nice game if you have a hour to kill. I have recommended this to friends and to my knowledge, no one has said &#34;I wish I didn't play that game&#34; after completing the game (unless they are a poor sport)."
1,0,"Who knew building train tracks would be fun?  In this game you have to build tracks around the US and secure the routes that you draw on your cards.  Its really fun to try to build your routes, and once you get 4 players involved the competition factor really ramps up because you will all be going for those middle spots.  Not much coop factor here unfortunately, but still makes a fun family game with no too much fighting or rule book checking."
0,1,"We love this game.  My 6, 8, and 10 year olds enjoy.  Its fun enough that I never mind playing with them.  Its easy to learn.  It also has a very nice box with each game piece having a place.  This makes for organized storage and game set up.  Huge plus for this house full of toys."
0,1,My wife and kids bought this game for me for my birthday. We played 2 games and my 10 year old daughter keep wanting to play again. It is a great game where everyone has a chance and it a lot of fun to play.But don't just believe me - Watch it being played[...]
1,0,"I needed that route!  You just cut me off, now instead of destination cards giving me gobs of points, now they all count against me.  There&#8217;s no way around!  My nerves have never felt more vexed than they do now.  That&#8217;s Jane Austin speak for: I&#8217;m seeing red and now I&#8217;m going to do anything I think might hurt your chances for the rest of the game; and the next one we play!Ok, so the first time this happens, there&#8217;s usually another way around, it&#8217;s probably the long way around, but hopefully you have enough trains to make it, because that&#8217;s a constraint you have to work under.Game PlayThis handsomely illustrated elongated board looks has a map of the United States dotted with notable cities that are connected by short and long lines of rectangles (or tracks).  In line of track is one of several colors.You start the game with some cards in your hand that are nicely illustrated train cars of the same several colors.  Each turn you either  take you can draw two cards from either some face up cards or &#8220;roll the dice&#8221; and choose some from a facedown draw pile, or a combination.  If you pick a wild from the face-up pile, you only get one card that turn.  buy a route (lay down your trains on the rectangles between cities)  You buy the track by discarding from your hand the same number and color of cards of the track where you lay down your trains.  Draw three Destination Cards.  You&#8217;ve got to keep at least one.  These give a method to the madness of which routes you buy.As you lay down your trains you rack up points, The longer the track, the larger the gain.  If you successfully complete the route on your destination card, you also rack up points, but those you conceal till the end of the game.The game ends a full round after someone has fewer than four trains- everyone but the catalyst gets another turn.Points are scored as I&#8217;ve said, but those destinations you weren&#8217;t able to complete, yeah those count as negative points.  Oooo.. ouch.I hate to tell you what to do but&#8230;Keep an eye on how many trains your opponents have left, don&#8217;t be stupid and fill your hand with destinations when you won&#8217;t have time to complete them.If it looks like a route you need is one that your opponent might need, you have a vested interest in getting there first, even if it&#8217;s an easy one.You may even consider drawing more destination cards for your first turn or two so that you can spend more time in the game working on more that are related. Than getting those you start with and drawing more in the middle of the game.What does &#8220;related&#8221; mean?  Consider the following routes:LA to Miami (goes from the south-east corner of the US to the south-west corner)New Orleans to Duluth (goes north and south through the center of the US)Salt Lake City to Houston (goes from the western US to the south-center)Because there could easily be much overlap in the first and third route, but not the second route, I&#8217;d dump the second route and keep the other two.ThemeWell, several off-shoots from Ticket to Ride have come.  Not to mention an expansions for the original game that adds several smaller routes.  So there is evidence that the theme can be slanted, but in Ticket To Ride Europe, game play is the same with some twists, like you can use someone else&#8217;s route for your destination&#8217;s sake without getting points for the route, and you route requiring tunneling through mountains are more pricey.  These off-shoot stand alone games are a good way for Days of Wonder to charge full price for what could have been a less expensive expansion to the existing game.I can hear you say, &#8220;Yeah, but they are boards in different venues!&#8221;Yes, they are, but Rio Grande seemed to be able to offer double-sided boards (Yes, that means two new maps) and new rule sets for Power Grid for less than half the cost of the original game.&#8220;Oh...  Really?&#8221;Yup.  But for comments to the theme itself, I think the original game is pretty strong.  Struggling to eek out routes to complete destinations- trying to get there before someone cuts you off can be very nerve racking, especially when two or more destination cards are riding on making that connection.  I&#8217;ve got lots of little trains!  Cool little plastic trains!BalanceWhile I often complain about chance and this game includes card, the fact that you don&#8217;t have to take all the destination cards you draw mitigates it, and that there are several face up cards to choose from also helps.  Anyone can build anywhere beats the imbalance Power Grid shackles you with.  Tit for tat.  Anyway, for having cards, I have no complaints.InteractionInteraction is low.  While verbal congrats are possible, expressions of dismay and indifference often follow someone laying track.  If you can&#8217;t reach the cards, there will be- &#8220;give me those two oranges&#8221; or, &#8220;how about two off the mystery pile of joy!  But as I think of it, this game could be played in silence.  So if you are entertaining that favorite group of mine to pick on- introverts, you already knew what you were in for.Learning CurveLow.  The purchase price card you get tells you how much things cost and the production of a square base on die roll and Robber operation are pretty easy.  Each development cards has what it does written plainly on it.  While the rules are easy, the options are pretty limited and objective is pretty straightforward.DowntimeNominal.  While you do have to wait your turn, there is a possibility that the track you want to buy gets bought on someone else&#8217;s turn.  If you pay attention you can make groans at the time they will pay off the most.What&#8217;s not to Like?I can&#8217;t think of anything bad to say that I haven&#8217;t already said.  It&#8217;s a great game that has done much good for the industry and I trust the makers are raking in mega bucks with all their spin offs.  If people are willing to pay, they deserve it.  Ah, the beauty of capitalism.  I guess there are eccentric people out there, who are happy to shell out another $35 to $50.Collateral EndorsementI haven&#8217;t come across a soul who didn&#8217;t like this game, but you may say that my social circles are small.  You are probably right, but I love growing them with games.  My kids love to line up the trains from here to there, but they have severed my board in one place, so beware, the (read: any) board is best set up on a table rather than the carpet floor where wee feet are wont to walk."
0,1,"Ihad my doubts at first.  Let's face it, when someone says &#34;Let's play monopoly,&#34; the first thing you think of is Oh no! a long boring game.  Well, that was my first impression when my husband suggested buying the game.  Totally changed my mind from the very first time we played the game.  We have family night and couples night with this game.  It is fun and worth the investment.  I know it's a little on the higher end of cost but it is lots of fun."
1,0,"Why do all the best board games originate from Europe?I read about this game on an on-line game site, highlighting some of the best family board games out there, and this is one that made the list. It looked fun and easy-to-learn, so I picked it up in time for the holidays. I had a lot of fun playing this with my family over Thanksgiving and Christmas get-togethers. The game is simple to learn, simple to play, and is really pretty casual. There's a small amount of luck and strategy involved, but most people can play this on an even footing and it is not geared towards competitive game-play. More fun with the full five players on the board, it can still be finished in about 1 hour of play. I highly recommend trying this game out!"
0,1,"Incredible game for almost any age group.  This board game has everything going for it.  It is a great deal of fun, as each new game requires a different strategy from the last.  The overall strategy tendencies are difficult to master, and after having played this game 50 times or more, I am still trying to decide the best strategic approach.  It is very easy to learn, and after one play through you will never need to look at the rules again.  The game is expertly constructed using materials that will not break or wear at any time in the near future.  I plan to realistically have played this game thousands of times before any pieces need fixed/replaced.  A group of my friends have a movie/game night once every week, and this seems to be the one game that everyone is always in the mood for.Overall, a great value for the price.  Great gameplay, and loads of fun!  Fun for gamers and non-gamers, as I have not found anyone that dislikes this game."
0,1,"When we first opened the box, we were all a touch worried that this might be a complex game to play.Thankfully, we found this to completely not be the case.Ticket to Ride is a fun game where 2-5 players pick up cards and attempt to create the longest routes and between cities. Scoring takes more than just the longest route into consideration (though that is the biggest factor).Having played this game at least 15 times from start to finish with 4 people, the average time it took us to play was roughly 40 minutes. Assuming you are OK with this, Ticket to Ride is a lot of fun and easily replayable.5 stars without question."
0,1,"I don't want to sound like a complete pessimist here. I still did enjoy this game pretty well, and I love board games of all types! I was just disappointed to buy and play such a highly acclaimed game to find that the mechanics don't allow you to do much.I play a wide array of games with lots of different people, so i know that casual games do have their place. My group has found that games like Pandemic or King of Tokyo are still simple enough to draw new people, and they allow for more fun game play. Ticket to Ride is a pretty good family game, and it could still be fun to play with groups of friends... I'm just looking for more in a game.Even some of the people who were new to games didn't feel that there was a lot you could do in Ticket to Ride and didn't find it very exciting. I know lots of people love this game however, and it may be good for other personalities. I would rather go for games like Pandemic, Carcassonne, King of Tokyo, Castle Panic, Scotland Yard, etc... I always loved train games too though, so this game will still be played, it was just a little disappointing."
0,1,Very rich in themePlays with a lot of people.Very hard to winCharacters are well thought out but the abilities and powers don't seem to stand out to much (some are very cool though)Varied gameplayPossible traitor!!!!!Worth a buy
0,1,"The first time I opened this game, I was with my brother in law, and as we started to play we were blown away. The game was difficult, we struggled to stay alive, and had fights that ultimately brought us to our death. We sat back and just smiled and went at the game again. The next time, the game was a walkthrough. We completed the quests with ease, and sat back bedazzled at what we did right vs wrong on the other game.Truth is we played the same. The game plays in a way where it can be difficult at times, to very easy.I have just ordered the expansion and this promises to fix this issue. No longer can we exploit our abilities to win the game easily. (according to the reviews at least... I will post one there after I have recieved my game),So my suggestion would be, if you want a great co-op game, pick this one up, it is easy enough to introduce players to, and reminds me partially of Pandemic.If you want a hard game, pick up both the expansion and this game in one go, from what I have seen the expansion completes this entire experience!"

0,1,"I've been wanting something like this for ages. I like having the ability to time speed reading for myself a little easier than using a stove timer or a hand timer. I just like having a sturdy colorful bookmark. I wish I had known that they were available in wild designs before I bought mine. Otherwise, I would of gotten the camouflage one. I think they are worth the money. I'll end up adding stickers to mine though. (I still like stickers, yes)... And reset is easy. You just press the Hours and Minutes. Their site has info videos on how it works. Though most people can pick it up right away. Very durable and kid proof product."
1,0,My daughter has had this product for 10 months now.  She uses it daily for her homework and used it very regularly over the summer as well.  Does a very nice job.  Haven't yet had to replace the battery.  And it helps her be more independent with her homework.  Pleased with the product.
0,1,"Not very easy for my little kids to use but it works. They get confused on the up or down arrow. Not sure on the settings until after a minute, then the clock shows the minute/time. They like to see the seconds too but this doesn't  have the seconds. I keep one in the van so when we are on the road I can keep track of their reading. The library gives them awards/prizes for minutes read in the summer. They will read for prizes and this is a good way for me to keep track."
0,1,"My kids love their elf &#34;Chippey&#34;. Every morning from after thsnkgiving to Christmas eve they wake up and the first thing they do is run to try and find where he is hiding. I think it is a nice, fun family tradition."
0,1,"This was a gift for my niece and nephew! A new Christmas tradition for them. The book is super cute and has already been read well over 30 times. They love the elf. I do not think he looks &#34;creepy&#34; at all. Super sweet and cute more like it. He has tight stitching and a detailed face. This is just a fun and creative was to countdown to Christmas. Makes each of the mornings exciting. The elf comes in many different eye colors, skin colors and even in girl. However makes it a little more difficult to pick just one, I had a brown eyed boy and blue eyed girl. We settled on the blue eyed boy, a little from each. Plus elves have just always been boys in my mind ;)"
0,1,All I can say is for the time from Thanksgiving to Christmas this elf was very busy talking to Santa about my 4 year old grand daughter. It was magical.
1,0,"Nice story ! The kids really look forward to the elf coming and staying with them till Christmas Eve. The kids enjoy looking for him each day and I love reminding him that he is watching. The kids are a little skeptical about Christmas, I hope I get another year of the magic."
0,1,This is a great story and so much fun!  It definitely keeps the spirit of Christmas alive!  It is as much fun for the adults as the kids!
0,1,"This is our daughter's very first Christmas and her elf will indeed appear on Thanksgiving Day.  Since she is too young to understand we are going to take pictures each morning of her elf in a new location so we can make a book to show her over the years!The book tells all about the elves and how important they are to Santa.  Your child's elf arrives on Thanksgiving and stays until Christmas Eve (when Santa arrives and the elf goes home with him).  Each night the elf flies back to Santa to report on your child's behavior ~ the good and the not so good ;)  By the time the children awake the next morning the elf has returned!  They will have a blast finding their elf in a new location each morning.There is only one rule: Children cannot touch the elf or it may lose its magic.  The elf also can't talk, but rest assured - he (or she!) hears every word.  Their elf not only informs Santa of their behavior, but their hopes and dreams too.I also love the fact that the book has a Christian element to it as it refers to children saying their prayers each night.  Don't wait!  Start this Christmas tradition this year and start making memories that will last a lifetime.Lastly, since our elf is a girl we purchased the newly released skirtThe Elf on the Shelf Presents: The Claus Couture Collection Accessory Scout Elf Skirtand it is adorable and very high quality!"
0,1,"Elf on the shelf is such a cute idea! We have 3 and 6 year old boys who saw the promotional show (sorry, can't make myself call a half hour promotional animation a movie) last year and loved the concept- watched the show over and over. So we grabbed this guy during the summer this year when it was cheaper. Been pinning good ideas and can't wait to show them they have their own elf this year =)"
1,0,"Our book and Elf arrived in our home on Thanksgiving and my daughter eagerly read the book and watched us put Elfin on our TV. She knew from the book that each night Elfin would fly to the North Pole and report to Santa. We never scared her with that if she disobeyed he'd cancel Christmas, but said that he was watching her. Every morning she'd come out of her room with a huge smile on her face searching for Elfin. She is looking forward to seeing him arrive at our home this next year!I got 2 extras for gifts for friends and family and it was a huge hit in their home too!"
0,1,"We joined the crowds and bought one this year, he was a lot of fun to move around the house and do funny tricks. I wish his limbs were more pose able and stayed put more easily. But the storage box was very sturdy and I like that."
0,1,I bought this for my grandchildren and they really enjoyed finding the elf each day and seeing what it was up too.  My three year old granddaughter would call me and let me know.  I think it is a cute idea.
0,1,I purchased 5 of these for my family.  They loved reading the story to their kids and enjoying the memories of the elf
1,0,My two-year old loves the Elf! Great story and tradition and it's definitely going to remain a part of our family for years to come!
0,1,"We opted to start this tradition last year, when our daughter turned 4, but waited until now to get her skirt. We also bought an additional male elf this year for our son (who will only be about 16 months for Christmas this year), and truly love the fun they bring, and the good behavior they encourage! :) The skirt is very sweet on our female elf, Twinkle. :)"
0,1,"I was going to make my own, but decided to just buy it.  I'm very glad I bought it.  The skirt is made with the same material as the elf, so it fits texture and colors perfectly.  It also fits very well.  I recommend for all girl elves!"
1,0,"Well, I've been playing LNOE for over a year now with a pretty big variety of people. Since my first play, I have gained a lot of respect for the game and the way it plays. Here's some thoughts on that:Gameplay - I'll only touch briefly on the basic game concepts here. Some players play as zombies, others as heroes on a board made of randomly chosen L squares around a center board. This means that the layout of the town is a little different during each game. Also, the game comes with several different scenarios that outline the victory conditions for each side. This helps make it so the game is a little different each time. Usually the hero players are trying to accomplish a specific goal (leaving town, saving townsfolk, etc.) and the zombie player(s) are trying to stop them. There is conflict (melee and ranged), but no player is ever eliminated from the game (though his original hero might be).Components - The game comes with several boards and a ton of minis (14 zombies and one for each hero). It also comes with a lot of punch-out chits for different things. The components are well made and durable (mine still look great after a year). The minis are well detailed, though they are not painted. The cards have an interesting art style based on actual pictures. I think they do a great job capturing the b-movie style of the game.Theme - As mentioned, this is a b-movie sort of game. The cards and quotes lend themselves to being both horror and comedy. In short, it's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and I like that. For the most part, I do think that the gameplay feels consistent with the theme. There are some exceptions, but very few things will pull you out of the experience.Fun - Alright. As far as I'm concerned this is the one that really matters. Is the game fun, and why? Firstly, this is a game that is about theme and conflict. That may turn some people off, but that's some of what I like most about it. The first time I played LNOE I played the 'Die Zombie Die' scenario as the instructions recommend. My friends and I had to consult the instructions pretty often since situations will come up that reqiure some specificity. The scenario for this play was just for the heroes to defeat a certain number of zombies before time ran out. To be honest, our initial reaction was absolutely 'meh.' 'Die Zombie Die' felt slow, unthematic, and predictable. To be honest, we didn't play again. But then I got a copy of the game for Christmas from my wife, so of course we had to give it another shot.It became pretty clear that the first time people played LNOE, they generally weren't too excited. For the first-time player, the game often feels lopsided in balance and somewhat predictable (especially if you use the DZD scenario). What became clear, however, is that when people gave the game a second chance it got much more interesting. The more you play the game, the more you begin to see a deeper level of strategy than you first suspected. The games get more interesting, and they get closer.At the start, myself and the other players felt sure that the game was misblanaced towards the zombie player. It always felt like that person won. Over time, however, we started to get better and the win ratio began to balance itself out (it stands now at right about 50/50 since we started keeping an actual record).All in all, I think LNOE is a game that should be played at least a couple of times to really judge. The more familiar with the game your players are, the more likely you'll have a close, suspensful game. You'll certainly still have a lopsided victory or two (luck demands it), but it will even out over time.Luck - I've heard the complaint several times that luck plays a bigger role than skill in LNOE. That may be a valid statement. A bad roll on an attack or movement can absolutely lose the game for a team. For me, that adds to the uncertainty and suspense of a game. Sure, it frustrates me when the dice don't seem to go my way, but I can live with that. If you prefer games with little or no chance element, this probably isn't the game for you.Expansions - This review is just for the base game, so I won't touch much on individual expansions. I felt, however, that I should at least mention it. As you can see on the main BGG page, LNOE has quite a few available expansions. While you might be interested in some more than others (or even none at all), it's a nice perk because they can really add some variety to the game. On top of that, there are several scenarios also available on the LNOE website for free. I myself have Growing Hunger and Survival of the Fittest. I like how much variety that gives me, so that we can play several games of LNOE in a sitting and not feel like we've plaed the same game over and over.To sum up, I think LNOE is a highly enjoyable, very thematic game. It sees a lot of play with my group, and I'm really glad I gave it a second chance."
0,1,"I'd say no board gaming/zombie movie enthusiast's collection is complete without this andZombies. Although they share a theme, they each have their own flavor of zombie movie. I'd say LNoE feels more like an 80s tongue in cheek zombie movie with the teens and purposely cheesy heroes, while Zombies!! feels more like the classic, overwhelming number of walking dead in Romero films. This one is easily the more complex and deeper of the two, so if you had to get one, I'd say go with this one, but zombies gets credit for creating the claustrophobic feeling of being surrounded and feeling hopeless. I've played this one a few times now, and while the basic rules are great to get you started, it gets even more fun with the advanced rules, and they're not that much more complicated. I'd say you're ready for them after a couple of basic level games. There are a good number of scenarios to choose from and with one side playing zombie and the other heroes, there's definitely a lot of replay value. The pieces are great quality for a board game and the cards are well done too, and can sometimes even being pretty funny as in being stuck in a location with a hero of the opposite sex while you share a ""let's at least have tonight"" moment. The accompanying CD gets a bad rap from reviewers but I thought it added to the feel, and hey how many games give you a free CD of music to set the mood? (Also found adding some dark classical or 80s goth does a good job of this) The rules can feel a little clunky at times, but it works very well. It feels balanced despite players going by different mechanics. An incredibly fun game that will leave every player feeling as satisfied as getting some fresh BRAAAAAINS! nomnomnom"
0,1,I love this game because it is a copperative game that helps children learn how to play together. The pieces are fun and colorful and durable. My child could play this over and over and not get tired of it. Great game!!! I would recommend this game!
0,1,"Party Gras is a fun game, IF you have a couple of things readily available:1. A Large Group of People - Party Gras shows a minimum of 4 players, but that is too small a group to play. Party Gras is best played with a group of 10 or more.2. People willing to be goofy. - You really have to lose your inhabitions playing Party Gras. If you have some party poopers, afraid to look foolish, then they will hate this game.3. Adult Beverages - This can REALLY help with loosening people up.The whole idea of Party Gras is to complete tasks given on a card - For instance getting another player to ask you to lower your voice, meaning you have to begin talking loudly until someone asks you to quiet down. To win the gamye you have to collect beads from other players while giving yours away. But in reality, Party Gras's main purpose is get folks laughing and having a good time, it's not really about winning or losing."
0,1,We tried to play this game New Years Eve with some folks over 50. It really wasn't very successful in that age group. I guess we are all a little too inhibited. :)) Would probably be a good game for the under 40 crowd.
1,0,"If I'm being honest, I must mention that although this game specifies 'thirteen and older' as its primary audience, the reality is that twelve and under kids are most likely going to enjoy this game. It's a party game that families can play, but accomplishing the tasks on the cards is more like kid-oriented fun. Gathering beads in order to win is the object, but unlike the real Mardi Gras there is no ""adults only"" behavior involved. I rated the durability high, but again this is a game that should appeal to younger kids - who are prone to losing things like the strings of beads or the cards. The game comes in kind of a cool clear, soft vinyl case. I liked the ""mind control"" category the best, which entails a little more subtle strategy that getting someone to refuse to pick your trash or finding someone who likes vampires more than werewolves. This is a game I can't imagine bringing out very often and its kind of expensive for what it is."
0,1,"HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET INTO THE FUN PART OF THIS GAME YET.  I'M GUESSING IF IT DOESN'T DRAW YOU IN THE FIRST FEW TIMES YOU PLAY IT, YOU WILL PROBABLY NEVER BE DRAWN IN."
0,1,"This game is wonderful! Yet another amazing game from this company!  Although it was a little hard for my three year old, he came up with his own way to play and loved it!  I know that he is going to be able to grow into this game. My friends' children also love this game. I would highly recommend this game!"
0,1,"My daughter, 5 years old, received this game as a Christmas gift. I also have a 2.5 year old. The girls love to play this game! My 5 year old loves to help her little sister find the letters and figure out how to sstttrrreeetttccchhh to reach all the spots.At the end of the game, the ""winner"" is who ever had the letter found on the super secret letter card. We have quite competitive children so we have made this game one that does not have a winner, but the person with the ""lucky letter."" Who ever had the ""lucky letter"" gets to choose if they are the caller or the stretcher on the next round.If my 5yo has a friend over, they often ask to play this game. After a round of instruction, they can play this game with parent support but not necessarily parent involvement. Sometimes it takes a little parent support to figure out how to reach all the letters but they are able to spin the ""tornado,"" call out the letters and help each other stretch to reach. It's fun to watch them play!"
1,0,"We bought this last year, and it's still in one piece! Not to mention the fun! We don't follow the rules exactly but make it more of a&#34;twister&#34; alphabet game we play with our 4 year old son, he LOVES it! Great educational tool!"
1,0,"Belfort takes elements of resources management, worker placement and area control and combines them into a fairly unique, fun experience.There are a lot of pieces in Belfort and it seems extremely complex at first, but the core gameplay is actually pretty straightforward once you get into the game.  It's depth and strategy arise from a series of choices players make in each round.  The components are of very high quality (as has been the case with all TMG games I've played so far), including wooden worker, resource and building tokens and heavy cardboard tokens and gameboards.Here are a few key points gameplay:1) There are seven rounds, with scoring occurring after rounds 3, 5 and 7 based on who controls the majority of buildings in each of the board's five districts and who has the most of each type of worker (elves, dwarves and gnomes).2) Each round essentially has three phases (the rules say five for clarity, but &#34;Phase 1 &#34;is just moving the marker that tracks which round you're on and &#34;Phase 5&#34; is scoring in rounds that have it).- During &#34;Placement&#34; players assign workers to tasks including gathering resources or money, earning special privileges for the round, training new workers or changing turn order.- During &#34;Collection&#34; players gain resources, income and pay taxes.- During &#34;Actions&#34; players build buildings, hire specialized workers (the gnomes), draw new building cards and/or use special powers.3) Each district on the board has 14 building spaces corresponding to specific types of building cards.  When a player builds a building they place a marker on an open space of that type on the board, and then can use the related card's special powers during the game.  The number of each player's buildings in a district determines scoring.I glossed over subtleties but that's the gist. It sounds more complicated than it is, although it's by no means an entry level game.  I found it well balanced and of reasonable length for a game of this type.While the game does support 2-5 players, be aware that the two player game is actually a variant of the &#34;full&#34; 3-5 player game.  With 2 players there will be extra &#34;phantom players&#34; that have buildings on the board for blocking and scoring purposes.  The rules suggest being familiar with the game before trying the 2 player version, but veteran gamers won't have too much trouble (I started with the two player).  This type of modification doesn't always work well, but I actually liked it here and thought it nicely adapted the game without really changing the feel.Overall Belfort is a great addition to my game library and something I can see myself playing fairly regularly.Highly recommended."
0,1,"Originally posted on [...], a new idea everyday!Product: Firefly the Board GameProducer: Gale Force NinePrice: ~$60Set-up/Play/Clean-up-3 HoursTL;DR- Take me back to the black! 90%Basics: Time to see the Verse!  This game is based on the popular, cancelled-too-soon television show.  Now, you need get to get a job, get a crew, and keep flying.  Each turn a player can take two actions.  These actions must be different.  The actions range from moving your ship, doing/starting a job, shopping, or getting new jobs.  You can either move your ship one space or burn fuel and move up to your engines&#8217; speed.  Moving the full amount also makes you draw event cards from an event deck for the type of space you&#8217;re in, either the central space or the outlying regions.  These events can range from nothing, to &#8220;finding&#8221; salvage, to having the reavers attack your ship.  Jobs form the bulk of the game.  As an action you can start a job.  When you start a job, you must be in the location indicated on the job card.  Starting may entail picking up a passengers, fugitives, cargo, or contraband.  Later, at any point in the game as an action, you can finish the job when you get to the right planet.  When you want to finish a job, you must have and pay the amount of items needed.  You may also have to do &#8220;Aim to Misbehave&#8221; card(s).  The Aim to Misbehave cards give you several options to succeed.  Usually, you have to add up the number of skill icons your crew and objects and add a die roll or have a key word/item to succeed.  When you finish the job, you get paid.  Also, when you finish a job for an individual you completed the job for, you also become solid and get extra options with that person.  Shopping lets you look through a deck of cards at a planet or draw random cards and buy two of them.  You can buy fuel, cargo, crew, and ship upgrades to keep your ship flying.  Dealing lets you draw two jobs from a deck of a specific job deck when on a planet. Players compete to complete a mission.  Missions range from pulling off a heist to getting a lot of money.  Often these missions have multiple parts and require going to multiple planets and misbehaving.  First one to complete the mission wins the game.Theme:  This game oozes theme.  You feel like you&#8217;re in the Firefly universe.  You get to go to iconic places and meet people from the show.  The game pieces, mechanics, and board all help with this also.  For me, this game sets the bar for theme for games going forward. 5/5Mechanics:  The game has some simple mechanics that really help with the theme.  The random encounters, aiming to misbehave, and missions all feel like they belong on the set of Firefly.  The game also has some simple resolution mechanics with the simple dice roll plus numbers.  Those are all great, but parts of this game are completely broken.  The companion captain is amazingly broken by getting free crew.  Some items and crew are completely overpowered.  Some combinations are completely unbeatable.  And this game has a runaway victor problem.  That doesn&#8217;t kill the game, but it does hurt the game a bit. 3.5/5Instructions:  The instructions are clear and well written.  I liked what I saw and was able to figure out how to play pretty quick.  I did have some questions, but these were not game ending questions like some games.  Heck the instructions have that mix of modern and cowboy slang that was famous from the show. 4.5/5Art/Execution: This game has some of my favorite parts of any game.  This game has Firefly universe money and its real cash!  You don&#8217;t know how amazing that is till you hear it slide against each other and feel it in your hands.  The other pieces are great too.  I liked the art.  It&#8217;s all feels like it just &#8220;fits.&#8221; 5/5Summary:  This is right up there with my favorite games of the year.  I get lost in this game, in a good way.  When I play, I get so wrapped up in the world and doing jobs that I forget about the game wining mission.  Heck, most of the other players do to.  That&#8217;s the mark of a great game.  When you want to keep playing so much that you don&#8217;t even want to win, you just want to keep playing. 90%"
0,1,"When a board game is made from a show you love you never know how it will turn out. I was so worried this would be a pasted on theme with just pretty pictures of the cast. All fears aside I think they nailed this one.Components are great. Mechanics fit the theme. I really feel like I am flying around the verse doing jobs, trying to avoid the reavers, avoiding the alliance, getting in solid with guys, upgrading my ship/crew, and making that money!My only complaint is the moving mechanic seemed to slow things down. If something stopped your moving, which happened often, you were stuck waiting until the next turn. We had 4 people in the game I played and it always took awhile to get back to you.I'm so glad I picked this one up."
0,1,I purchased this game to be used during a trip with my granddaughters ages 6 and 8.  They loved the game so much that one of them asked that I purchase another one just for them for their birthday.  It is a great tool to assist them in broadening their vocabulary and spelling skills while enjoying the competition of a game. It is easy to play and understand.  Melissa and Doug have designed a visibly appealing and durable product with all parts attached to the one board eliminating the chance of losing pieces.
0,1,This is a very creative game.  It is sturdy and built out of the traditional Melissa and Doug wood.  It is rather noisy though.  When you flip the letters the wood on wood slap hurt my younger daughter's ears when playing in the car.
0,1,This game is a great addition to my travel pack.  I take it camping and we have played it many times without complaint.  Another blast from the past.  Loved playing this game as a child and love it as an adult.
0,1,"I love this sort of games, with which kids can be creative and use their brain, and can share time with adults around them as well."
1,0,"We've had a lot of fun playing this since opening on Christmas day. The cubes are made of a high quality resin (?) that doesn't feel cheesy or cheap. The larger letters allow my child with visual spatial issues to more easily see words as she tries to build. All of the letters that may be ambiguous (m,z,n etc.) are clearly marked as to which side is down. Great strategy game that also builds vocabulary and spelling etc. Great buy that will get lots of use!"
0,1,"Bought this for my grandchild. Haven't given it yet, but this is really cute. Seems well made. Should last a while."
0,1,"I've read mixed reviews on this product, so I thought I'd just see for myself. Considering how much my daughter (2 and a half years old) adores Abby in Sesame Street, I figured she would love this as well. I imagine Gund has taken past criticisms into account (or I got quite lucky), but the doll we received was well made and adorable. My daughter spent a day studying the doll (not sure what criteria she was using since she cant really verbalize it) and it seemed to pass her scrutiny as well. The dress seems okay (one of the primary complaints was regarding its flimsy manufacture and potential choking hazard). From my observation, the doll is soft, cuddly, and doesnt seem to be a hazard at all (at least where my daughter is concerned, but she also doesnt gnaw on it like I imagine a lot of kids are prone to do). She simply totes Abby around along with her Elmo doll, sets them up in poses, sits them down to watch tv with her, and generally plays with the doll just like I figured she would. I'm quite pleased with the purchase overall.I did only give it four stars because, as nice as it is, I think the likeness could have been a little better, but overall, I think this is a very nice toy for toddlers."
0,1,She is the cutest doll and my granddaughter just loves her. She is one of her favorite dolls to play with. Got it for a great price and quickly.
0,1,This is an awesome game!  The humor is very fun and a bit twisted.  I love the Chain Mail Bikini!  It's great for playing in a diverse group of people.  Fantastic for a great night of fun with friends.
0,1,"We went over to a friends house, and were introduced to this great game,  I loved it so much, I bought it for us, and now have 1-7. still need 8.  There are other varieties, and expansions to add to this base game. We now have Munchkin Game Night weekly, and are invited to another place to play once a month.  We are totally addicted!"
1,0,"I expected this game to be a hilarious take on popular role playing games, like Dungeons and Dragons. And it really did turn out to be just that. Munchkin will appeal to fans of RPG's, but also to those who have always just made fun of them as well, thanks to the comical bent.The only reason I'm giving this game four stars is because of how difficult this was to initially get going. If you read through the rule book, you'll quickly find yourself overwhelmed and left with two questions for every answer the directions bring to mind. Everything is there, but the ordering of the instructions is very strange and vastly confuses things which really ought to be simple. The best advice I can give is to not think too much about having all the rules down before you jump into the experience. Give yourself and your crowd a test run, just to get a feel for what can and can't happen. This should make your life much easier than the rule book will if that's where you intended to start.This game has very few things to really wrap your head around. You've got some cards, need some poker chips (or coins of any type) for counting your level, and...yeah, that's about it. Moving pieces and mass game boards disappear with this little treat of a game. Once you've played a few rounds, it makes for a quick and easy game to dive into. And is also easily put away. Even the price is lower than I've come to expect for this type of game. So try it out. You'll be glad you did."
0,1,"I tried playing and my eyes glazed over and I was so so lost; meanwhile 6 kids sit down figured it out and can't quit playing.""Oh, take a halfling from Matt"""" I have borrowed swords.""""Does anyone have a plutonium dragon?""""Do you have a wandering monster?""""I have an illusion card.""""I have a nasty drooler.""""Can you kill it?""""You'll trade me 2 treasures for that?""""Is anyone a warrior?""""I'm a warrior; I would give you... no, I'm not going to trade my warrior.""""Let's take a level away from Matt.""""I could make you an elf, Madi.""""I'll just try to run away.

0,1,"Continuing with the popular Munchkin series of games, Star Munchkin adds a hilarious twist with this sci-fi theme. Have you ever wanted to attack a space alien with a &#34;Laser-Laser-Mazer-Dazer-Bananananfofaser&#34;? Well, now you have the chance! Great fun for any Munchkin fan who also enjoys such series as &#34;Star Trek&#34; and &#34;Star Wars.&#34;"
0,1,"A friend of mine owns this and theFrag Gold Edition FTW Board Gameexpansion, and we enjoy playing it quite a bit from time to time.  It's pretty easy to learn and has an interesting game mechanic, so when I saw it for sale on Amazon for less than $15, I decided to invest in a copy of the base game myself. Here are a few things I like about the game:(a) High quality components... and LOTS of them(b) I have to mention the 6 plastic figures in particular because they look pretty cool and I also use them when we play Star Munchkin on theMunchkin DeluxeorMunchkin Level Playing Field Card Gamegame board (instead of the figures or tokens that come with those boards).(c) The double sided map adds significantly to the replayability of the game.(d) So does the fact that it has 112 cards, including 34 weapons, 56 gadgets, and 22 special cards.  We usually play 2-3 players, so things that come up in one game usually don't turn up again until two or sometimes three or four games latter.(e) You get to roll LOTS of dice.  It comes with 18 six-sided dice, but sometimes you need even more.  It is very fun when you get to roll that many dice.The main thing we don't like about the game is that you can drop an empty weapon on one turn and pick it up fully loaded the next turn. Because of this, and on a related note, we typically remove (or limit to one time use) the portable nuke weapon since this combo really breaks the game for us.  In spite of this, it is a fun filler game that is definitely worth trying, especially if you can get it for a great price."
1,0,"Our 2 year old hasn't taken too much to these yet ( I still have hope).  What I like about them is they are a good size for his hands, they stack great.  You can use them to help learn counting and color recognition.  The foam peg board works OK for the purpose.  I was a little skeptical at first about the board."
0,1,"My 22 month old twins LOVE this toy. They love to connect them and stick them in the wholes on the board. Yesterday while doing this toy with one of my daughters she connected only the same colors! Purple on purple, blue on blue, etc. I was so proud!  Great toy, provides lots of fun for me and my twins. Oh, and they're fine motor skills have really improved with this toy!"
0,1,"This toy came with no instructions. Don't know whether to turn the textured side of the mat up or down. And comes in a plastic storage bag.  That's dangerous!!  That said, the toy itself is fun for my 2 year old granddaughter.  She immediately took the pegs and pushed them in the holes. We practice her colors and ask her to find a ""lellow"" ""bru"" or ""geen"" one, lol.  Orange is a new color for her, so that was fun. This keeps her interest for a good while.  We stack them all on a long pole and place it between furniture and she climbs under it.  I plan to make her a cloth carryall for the pieces.  I just don't feel good about that plastic zipper bag."
0,1,Love the easy grip pegs with wide head great for little hands to push.  Love the bright colors as well as the ability to use in various ways; stackable if you dont want to use the pad.
0,1,"This peg toy allows my 2 year old grandsons to use new skills. They have to work hard to master putting the peg into the mat. The mat needs to be thicker which would make it easier for them and also keep the mat from warping so that the mat will lie flat. Overall, it is a great toy that could be tweaked in this way to be even better! I think they will play with this for several more years as they get better at stacking the pegs or creating designs. Great concept!"
0,1,"For the girlie-girl who loves imaginative play with fashion design, arts and crafts, etc. THIS is the toy for you!There's hours and hours of play here, producing all the fun little outfits that you can imagine you'll be wearing yourself. And, like all great projects, creativity begets more creativity ... and the sky is the limit when you get into that ""zone."" There's no end to what your imagination can produce.Luckily, the Klutz company web site can provide you with more papers for these great projects! Every girl I've given this to has adored Paper Fashions."
0,1,"These are not bad, but the velcro on the palms of monkeys' hands that is supposed to hold them together does not. If you are not going to use them in that manner then these finger puppets are fine otherwise. They are nicely made, good quality, but the velcro is my main issue with them."
1,0,This book completely fascinates my daugthers (4 and almost 3).  They think it's wonderful that has you turn the page another bright coloured ribbon appears - and as you go through the book a rainbow is made.It's a really lovely story about a rabbit and rainbow and a lovely way to learn colours.I think it's a wonderful book to give as a gift and one that will be enjoyed for many years.
1,0,"This is a very different kind of book, quite innovative in it's use of ribbons to creat a ""rainbow"" page by page as you read the charming little story to your youngster.  The bright graphics and lovely colored ribbons make for an eye-popping experience as little ones revel in the pretty colors and see how the rainbow develops one color on top of the next.  By the end of the story you magically have a glorious rainbow and your child will want to read it again and again!"
0,1,My 14 month old son absolutely loves this book. My wife and I read it to him multiple times a day. He loves touching the monkey heads and the repetition. He book seeks out the book and has a motion to indicate that he wants this specific book!
0,1,"This book is my 6 month old's favorite touch and feel book.  Each page shows a picture of baby feet touching some kind of textured surface on the left side and then a huge touch and feel piece of that material on the right.  I have never seen a touch and feel book with such large areas to touch.  It is really wonderful!  Also, the textures on each page a pretty different in feel and color so each page really feels like a new texture.  My only complaint is that the book is not longer!  We are always sad when it is over!"
0,1,"We've become board-book experts (snobs?!) over the last ten months. This is by far one of the nicer ""touch and feel"" varities out there. The feeley spots are large and visible for young babies and there is a nice variety of textures: terry cloth towel, sand paper, faux grass, deep shaggy fleece, silk leaves that crinkle, short fuzzy fleece. The pages are stiff ad sturdy, the spine/binding is well made. Colors are bright and photos are pretty. Our 10-month-old daughter loves this book! (...Now, if only it had ""lift and look"" flaps too, it would be perfect!)"
0,1,"You will have hours of fun with this game as you try to simultaneously make your family more miserable as you increase the happiness of other players'families.  With characters like red-headed stepchild, what's not to love? Plus, the cards are made of a durable plastic, so no matter how much you play, they do not become  worn.  Overall, a very fun toy for adolescents and adults. The directions may be too complex for children."
0,1,I'd recommend Unwelcome Guests before Unfortunate Expeditions but UE is still a great expansion.  It adds another layer to the game mechanic with an ongoing Expedition that will change how everyone dooms their family.  I just wish they'd put a little marker somewhere on the face of the card so you know it belongs to a certain expansion to make it easier to separate out the cards when you don't want to play with the expansion mixed in with your base deck.
1,0,"Replay value is one of my biggest concerns in buying new games, and Citdels has a great replay value as it is easy to teach to someone new and is a fun strategy game of being sneaky and finding out what everyone else is trying to do and stop them. Non stop action. Buy this game."
0,1,"First of all, this is 2 games in one because it comes with the expansion. That's a win right there. The expansion pretty much doubles the variety and replayabililty of the game too, so that's good.This game is good because if you pay attention you have a slight idea of what everyone is doing, but you can't know for sure. That leads you to syke yourself out because you plan your strategy based on what you think other people will do. Then you think to yourself, ""what if they do something else, i'll be screwed."" So you change your mind, but then you realize that maybe the original strategy was safer or better so you switch back. Then, you go insane and flip over the table when it doesn't work out the way you wanted. If you find that experience enjoyable get this game.This game is good for 3 or 4 players. Anymore, and it becomes like waiting on line at Walmart. I know you don't like to do that because I used my deductive sherlock holmes mind to find out you shop on Amazon. Plus with 4 or less players you get 2 turns per round. Double action = Double fun = Double strategy = Double Combos = Double Kill, Flawless victory. 2 players is good too (because of less waiting), but imo the attack cards become a little overpowered and the target is, to put it simply, obvious. (It's the only other player, if you are confused).Also, you must get sleeves for the character cards. Even if you sleeve nothing else in your entire game shelf. Get 18 sleeves for the character cards in Citadels. They get handled a lot."
1,0,"I've owned this game for a couple years now and must say it is a great game with good strategy and re-playability.  The graphics and card quality as usual with Fantasy Flight Games is excellent.  The only drawback is that with the cards having a black boarder they are showing some wear and tear with color fading, but as i said I have owned it for a few years and has been in the rotation of the regular games we play that whole time. Overall definitely a card game I would recommend."
0,1,"This is a game that I often get out when couples are over.  It's easy to play and understand, but tough to master the strategy.  It's a card game.  You draw roles, and play according to the role you randomly pick.  The strategy is to know how to use your card's strength.  Very fun, and fast game, that I would highly recommend."
0,1,"The basic rules of the game seem simple enough but things really get interesting once the players start to get a better feel for how each of the character roles work from a strategic perspective. For example, seeing a player build-up an increasing amount of gold may potentially be aiming to build more districts with the aid of the abilities of the Architect or destroy rival districts with the power of the Warlord. Thus you might want to take the role of the Assassin to kill either character role or use the Thief to steal the gold - provided you guess what the role of that player is going to be.Thus it becomes a game with a need to read your rival players well as you hope to determine what their chosen character roles are in order to gain some sort of a competitive advantage. Thus often times people will opt to switch over to being the King in order to choose his character first the next time around, however the King is a pretty high profile character that is often targeted for assassinations as well. And quirks of the possible strategies goes on and on.With the full expansions, you can play with about 2-7 players, but the game really starts to shine once you have at least 5 at the table. And the expansions let you have alternate character swap in to replace the original 8. Or you can add in special district cards that do anything from requiring players to say &#34;Thank you your Majesty&#34; every time the King calls on your role or even change the end game condition to just 7 districts instead of 8.Citadels isn't your run-of-the-mill card game and it can quickly become a rather high-stakes game of strategy, especially among good friends. As always, the better you know other players, the more interesting the game as you may stand a better chance of reading them - but they can also better read you."
0,1,This game is so massive it scares all of my lesser nerd friends away. C'mon guys it's not that hard. Learn the difference between a round and a phase...
0,1,"First off, this game is a blast! I've played it a few times and every time is unique, challanging, fun, and most of all, it creates memorable moments. Word of warning, though, if you're new to more complex board games, this one's a doozy, but don't let that scare you away from the game. When learning how to play, it helps to have the board set up and sort of mock play a few turns, reading ALL the directions and playing through the scenarios the rules cover. The first game you actually play might move a bit slow at first, but once all the players learn how the turns work, the game moves along at a good clip."
1,0,"Let me start out by saying this is a great game to those who are willing to learn the rules!I enjoy this game as it has so many elements in a game that I have been looking for! Although finding people patient enough to sit down and play with me, that is the tough part! It seems they just get lost in the rules and what can be done and why something is happening rather than just sitting back and enjoying the game.If you like HP Lovecraft and enjoy diving into the universe he created, this game is a great one to pick up. If you are looking for a game where you can play with friends, but with less complcated rules, Id recommend Mansions of Madness first, as I feel that is a great introduction game to this type of game."
1,0,"I bought this game because I like Lovecraft's work. The game itself is very fun and addicting. It's not hard to set up and the rules are not difficult. I don't know about these people who have ""degrees"" who can't figure it out, but I'm glad I didn't take their word for it. The idea for this game is very fun and It can be played solo."
0,1,"Arkham Horror is one of my favorite board games of all time. Unlike the vast majority of games ever devised, the players are placed into a cooperative - not a competitive - environment, and with good reason: the horrors of H. P. Lovecraft's imagination have sprung to life and the eve of the Apocalypse has come! This rich setting, coupled with the quality and intricate detail of Fantasy Flight's design, provides countless hours of enjoyment for fans of tabletop strategy games and mythical worlds. Also, numerousexpansionsets exist to inject new life into the base game, like adding additional neighborhoods to a Monopoly board.Each turn requires a good deal of maintenance and upkeep, as if you are in a role-playing game where everyone shares dungeon master duties, or playing a video game where the computer's calculations must be done by hand. This level of complexity, as well as the subject matter, make it unsuitable for young children; any teenager or adult comfortable with Magic: The Gathering or Axis & Allies will likely master the mechanics in two or three sittings.As others have noted, the rules are at times almost incomprehensible; I sometimes wonder whether any two playgroups have ever played by the same interpretation of the rules, let alone the correct one! It is completely understandable that some people dislike the game because of this fact, but for those of us who recognize that the point of the game (from the monster's perspective) is to drive the players insane, that is to be expected!"
0,1,"Arkham's first big box expansion. It's a solid add and goes nicely with the game, though future expansions integrate better and add more. It's a great expansion to get if you're a newer Arkham player and are ready to ramp up your games, but not quite ready to make it as intense as future expansions make it."
0,1,"I wanted this expansion as a cure for Arkham burnout, and it did not work. If you love Arkham Horror, great, but it. If you are getting tired of Arkham, this is more of the same."
0,1,"This is a fun board game, that can handle up to eight people.  It is not hard to pick up, and a quick explanation can allow new players to understand the basics enough to play in a few minutes. It would be best if at least one person had a detailed understanding of the rules, as there are a few things that come up that don't happen often.  It has a unique way of handling turns, which ends up rotating who goes next in a fashion that is unlike most games--it is based off of how many &#34;turns&#34; (or minutes) an individual takes at any given time--the more they take, the longer they wait for their next turn--based off of how many turns other players take as well.It is amusing, and challenging.  But with a lot of new players, can drag on a bit, if people don't fully understand the strategy.  A full game can take two hours if you have 8 people, many of whom have never played it before.  This can cause the game to get a little...tiresome, and is best if enough people know what to do and can plan ahead of time (This is true for all board games of this type)."
1,0,"I bought Red November based on the only other review here.We have family game night 2x a week with 2 adults and a 13yo.  I was looking for a cooperative game to play.  The only other true cooperative we have isCastle Panic, which is also a great game.Let me point out that this game takes place aboard a gnome submarine therefore everything about the game is small - including the board, the cards, and the pieces.At first the game was so boring, my eyes were glazing over while I listened to the rules being read aloud as we tried to play.  However after a few rounds the rules just clicked.The game play was fairly quick.  It took us about 30-40 minutes to play, including trying to learn the rules.We laughed so hard that we could barely draw new cards.  Several parts of our submarine caught on fire, we dealt with a few floods, and one of our players became a drunken, staggering gnome as we desperately tried to find him a cup of coffee as an antidote.  Some people might be offended at the fact that the gnomes drink beer, but it isn't really the focus of the game. The gnomes have 4 hit-points (lives/health points) and each beer they drink takes 1 away from their points.  If he has a beer, drinking it gives the gnome an advantage to repair certain ""problems"" that arise throughout the game.  Besides, it made the storyline very funny.We did escape the submarine and win, but only barely.We'll definitely pull this one out again next time.  Thank you Mitchell in VA for reviewing the game!"
1,0,"Red November is a cooperative game in which the players win or lose as a team.The conceit is that the players are the crew on a Gnome Submarine (don't sweat the gnome bit - it plays only a ""color"" role in the game). This submarine is the worst maintained craft to ever set sail and the crew spend all their time fighting fires, pumping floods, fixing the engines or the oxygen pumps or the reactor or the eager to self-launch missile armament. And if that isn't bad enough, *someone* really should go out with an aqualung and a spear and kill the Kraken before it cracks the hull like an eggshell.The game features an innovative time-line movement scheme in which everything a player does costs time, the player can decide how much in most cases, and after the player has fixed the engines or put out a fire or pumped a flooded room out (etc) the time is accounted for and Bad Stuff happens - like more fires breaking out, rooms flooding, hatches jamming, engines quitting, reactors overheating or missiles announcing their intention to launch in ten minutes unless someone does something about it. This means that players precipitate trouble for everyone but mostly whoever comes after them in the move scheme (though in my first game someone managed to re-flood a room they'd just pumped out and drowned as a result). The last person on the timeline is always the first to move, so everyone sort of keeps up with each other on the clock as it were. It looks strange but works well and there's a tactical element to using one's move intelligently.Each time someone gets a turn they can move as far as they want (or are able to given the jammed hatch/flooded compartment/blazing inferno situation), then they take one of a limited set of actions, check for getting killed and do bookkeeping (which is where the events happen).Events and gear that help players out are presented as cards and are easy to understand.Gnomes get the courage to go into burning rooms by drinking grog, which makes them tipsy, which can make them faint. This is bad (because fires and floods can happen while you are in a dead faint, and that can kill you). Gnomes can drink coffee to counter their drunkenness.I had the misfortune in my first game to open the action by setting fire to the two rooms in which one could pick up gear, and every effort to address this state of affairs was stymied by the deplorable failure of just about everything else between the crew and these rooms. Half the crew survived, but only one room in the sub was dry and not on fire by then, and the reactor was halfway and more to cooking off. Don't get me started on those wretched engines that almost took us to Davy Jones's Locker every third turn or so. It was the most fun I've had in ages.The physical make-up of the game is impressive. Pawns (gnomes) and movement markers are plastic, reactor, engine and oxygen status markers are wooden blocks color-coded for their respective tracks, the cards and counters are sturdy & well-printed, the board harkens back to ""The Awful Green Things from Outer Space"" and presents the playing surface and various status tracks clearly. The artwork is amusing and entirely in keeping with the theme, which is inspired in it's humor.The rulebook is clearer than the usual FFG affair, but there are some ambiguities in the first half that are clarified only in the detailed second half. For example, the first description of the situations arising from adjacent rooms with different levels of water in them will have your players drowning unless you go to the second, more detailed description. The wording is just wrong in the first attempt.That notwithstanding this game harkens back to an age when boardgames were popular and ubiquitous, and so were easy to learn.Highly recommended."
0,1,"The game pieces are good quality. I was impressed.The game is thematically true to the series, and captures the atmosphere well. Though the rule book looks intimidating at first, once you start to play, it all comes together in a very real way. The game is incredibly exciting. I highly recommend."
0,1,"I don't think I have ever played a board game that so perfectly captured the feel of the source story. Lies. Betrayal. Paranoia. Enemies in every corner and the universe stacked against you. As the human player, you know full well that if you win it is only going to be by the skin of your teeth, and certainly not with all of your crew intact. In fact, after several games we finally had our first ""win"" last night after a hard fought battle. It was a brilliant, suspenseful game with the power balance of the Cylon players and the human players coming down to a single flipped card.The game play is complex, and takes an investment of time to learn the rules. LikeArkham Horror, this is a game that highly benefits from having a resident rules lawyer who can guide less-experienced players through the phases and their options.  We found 4-5 players to be just about right.  A typical games lasts about 3-4 hours, and it can be a long wait in-between turns with too many players.  We have one of thePegasus Expansion, that adds to the complexity and game length.The element I love the most about Battlestar Galactica Game is the secret Cylons.  That single piece adds so much tension and enjoyment to the game.  Until the final reveal, you never know who is on whose side, and it all comes down to the finest of wires.  A single flip can change everything when one of your allies reveals himself as the enemy.  That was a brilliant bit of game design, and keeps the game fresh every time you play."
0,1,"Talisman is one of the most difficult games to find time to play with my group, with an average game length of 4 hours (for 4-6 players). At few points in the game does it feel like a mental battle of wits between multiple parties. The most exciting parts of the game are dice battles between two evenly matched opponents. Randomization is absolutely the biggest problem with Talisman, even if I like the theme and character building aspects.Your average turn consists of:1. Roll and move clockwise or counterclockwise2. Drawing a random card from the deck3. Fighting a random dice battle with enemiesThe players are run around the starting area seeing who can luck into the best items and stats until inevitably someone becomes strong enough, gathers a Talisman, and moves in for the Crown of Command to see if they can win the game. Who becomes the most powerful is very rarely a test a skill, but rather who draws the best items or gets a few lucky rolls. The test of skill in this game is deciding when you are powerful enough to attempt the inner areas of the board.It's the kind of game that you can spend 5 minutes in between turns that have zero effect on you. The minimal choices and large amounts of downtime make it a social game, but since a slow played six player game can last up to 6-7 HOURS, it is absolutely grueling at times. Never have I seen a board game group more beaten and slumped than at hour 6 in a game of Talisman. It's not at all that the game isn't fun, but in my experience it's a bit of a hassle scheduling time to play such a light game then having to worry about players getting bored with such a light, lengthy game.There are so many much, much better experiences I've had these days with games similar or otherwise. I just don't think this one aged too well."
0,1,"Great Game.  If you like bluffing, like poker, or confrontation games like Risk or Axis and Allies, this game is at the top of the class.  The main rule is that your alien character somehow circumvents and or otherwise breaks a rule or rules in the game.  The rules and the way the game plays allows for interesting player interaction.If you are looking for a game to get for someone that likes the bluffing and ante aspect of Poker then you will like this game.  Give it a try it's a classic and it's worth every penny."
0,1,"I saw a gameplay video of Space Hulk on YouTube and thought it was really cool (the warhammer universe is creative, huge and exciting), so I started looking for the game and found this... a card/deck version of the board game.I got the main set plus 3 expansions (one for more space marines, one for more tyranids and a mission pack). They all serve its purpose. They give a little more richness to the core game. The mechanics are simple (the rules aren't so easy to understand), and the goal of survival seem fun enough. It is, in the begging, then it wears out.The sole purpose of the spacemarines is to survive... you do this by using action cards and rolling one dice, and that is basically it. You do get tense moments when you realized that an event card may have just killed the character you love... but after a couple of runs, it gets dull. Since the price is not that high, you could give it a go... but if what you want is a good co-op game, I would recommend looking at the Lord of the Rings LCG or Marvel Legendary."
0,1,"Well, this game is based on most popular game warhammer 40K, which I played in pervious 15 years and I also have space hulk since 2nd edition.  I like the art work on this card game, and wish this game to be portable space hulk.  Sadly, no...... This game is soso.  You do need 13+ for this game as it listed on the box due to the complicated setting, and there isn't any armor save, special weapon, and combat experience as warhammer 40K.  Most likely, it's a game with 2 monsters ""broodlord & genestealer"".  Rolling 4+ to kill gensteraler and 5+ to kill broodlord per a 6 sides dice.  Each space marines has different attacking range from 0 to 3.  If you get stormbolter mark as supplement, you get a chance to reroll.  The game end when space marines all died, or run out of location card with having done the assignment of last location card. It's very simple, but there are location and event cards, not easy for players to image the whole area as space hulk board game.After trying couple runs with friends, we gave up this game.  It's not fun as we expected.  Not with the experience as warhammer 40K and the space hulk board game.  It a card game without the spirit of warhammer 40k, but art work....."
0,1,"Frostmarch continues the expansion of Talisman by adding 4 characters and some variations to the victory conditions.The new Characters themselves are ok (Warlock, Leprechaun et/al)and the new cards, spell and warlock quest cards are not so bad but the alternate endings are frankly inadequate.There is one public and two secret alternate endings, the public one involves the Warlock Quests.  A bunch of new Warlock quest cards are added and using this scenario allows you to win by completing 4 warlock quests (the 4th provides the necessary Talisman) and getting to the center first. Two secret choices are A Crown & Scepter combination that works like the Crown of Command but is more powerful and the Ice Queen a 12/12 character that seems kinda easy.This seems very little bang for the bucks.  Fantasy Flight games adds two other cards you can print online (The Actual Crown of Command, and something called Danse Macabre) they make a big difference but to use them I have to download them and print them on card stock that I have to buy myself.Why do I have to do this if I'm already paying $25 for an expansion without a board?  Of course if they were all available online then there is no reason to buy the expansion.It's worth having but I really expected better."
0,1,"i picked up this game because i always like the option to play solitaire if possible.  i'm interested in the hobbit expansions, though after playing a few games of this, i will probably wait and get other expansions before that one.  i also picked this game up instead of game of thrones LCG because i heard that AGoT was more fun with more people, and this one scales well (making it fun with two, or even solo).  read up on any of these games on boardgamegeek for lots more info.  happy gaming!"
0,1,"This item is made well, which means that I will likely be able ot use it for several years.  The pockets are large enough that my two and four year old can get out the items and return them without tearing the pockets.  Additionally, each item has a number on the back, so my daughters can return each item to the correct spot.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but this proved to be worth it as my daugthers played with this almost every day and it is showing no wear."
1,0,...and she is only 15 months old! Great way to count down to Christmas. Well made and will keep your child's interest. We put ours up in the dining room and add the day's character after dinner.
0,1,"After buying this base set and 3 add-on expansions, I regret it. I heard it was one of the best in it's class and have always loved the Fantasy theme especially in board/card games, so I bought it.(Side note: I played the regular rules and then the Tom Vasel ""Epic Thunderstone"" rules as well.)I guess now after other complex card games have come out, it's easy to be down or negative on this historical game. For it was the 3rd game to come out in this genre as a ""deck-builder"" type game and still be different from classic, popular and all powerful Magic the Gathering card game.What is nice is that you don't have to take out a large loan to buy this game (like Magic). Instead it has a rather large amount of cards right in the box ready to be played. I do enjoy fantasy based games and video games so I was hoping this would fit my desires, but sadly this game falls incredibly flat.Quality: The cards have a nice raised textured pattern to them and fairly thick. The box is thick with a very nice insert to help you organize the cards. It all has a nice quality and will probably stand up over time. My only concern here is, much of the cards are surrounded by black ink and if you scratch or ""nick"" the cards, it is very visible (and doesn't look good).Art/Graphics: I have listened to other game reviews ""rave"" about the art, and until recent expansions of this game, I do not agree with the others. I do not like the art (especially the base set) and think it isn't up to the standards of the rest of the gaming world. Some cards they are down-right comical. Not to mention some of the art does not match and looks like another game entirely and very different styled artists were employed to create it.Price/Value: This game is very overpriced. For the amount of cards you get and the thickness of the box and it's nice insert, it's more worth $20-30, but not the asking price.Base mechanics: Basically deck building games imply that you are BUILDING your hand in order to be able to do actions on your turn (e.g. slay a monster or buy a good weapon). In many other games (such as the video game World of Warcraft or Skyrim) you can customize your character in order to be successful at your deeds. Collecting weapons and ""heroes"", only serve to give you attack points or buying points. For a hero really isn't a HERO in Thunderstone. This hero is just a number on a card with some art. You could have pasted a factory worker on the card trying to repair a broken down assembly line, because the theme and actions seem completely ""pasted on"".On your turn, you use 6 cards in your hand to do buying or attacking... that's it. If you don't have the right cards drawn on your turn, you may or may not do anything. However, simply to the point, the game ends up being is a ""gathering card"" game. As soon as you see your opponent killing monsters (and getting victory points in the process) it's a sprint for the finish line. It doesn't feel like a game, and at times the game felt like it was playing me. Thunderstone has very little strategy and much too much chance/luck involved. Thunderstone seems like an advanced version of Dominion which is a hugely boring game to me.To End: I should try and sell mine on Ebay where I'd get a great price for it. But I am probably going to keep it for those friends who want a think-less non-complicated game. Thunderstone is so flat and ""outright nothingness"" to it's core mechanics, that I am incredibly surprised this game is so popular. There is so many better games out there, that you would be better off with another one of them. For example, Lord of the Rings Living Card Game and/or Mage Knight are similar in theme and both are card games, yet they both have real consequences to what you do and real strategy that require you to think things through and make good decisions.In the end, ""to each his own"", and this game doesn't appeal to me or involve ""fun"". However, don't take my word for it, be very careful and watch some youtube videos on how it's played before you buy... you'll be glad you did the extra research."
0,1,"Open this box costing less than any of the rulebooks for D20-derived High Fantasy RPGs and you are in for a treat.You get a gamesmaster book in glorious full color containing the parts of the game the GM needs to master and the bestiary, alomng with oodles of advice presented in such a beginner-friendly format I reckon the only downside is a veteran GM will feel a little underwhelmed by the cartoony, easy-peasy approach to the material compared with the no-nonsense full rulebook. But hey, the experienced GM is not who this set was aimed at. Read accordingly. Everything you need to run a game on this set's terms is in here and presented in a way that makes uptake easy. There's also an introductory adventure.You get a player handbook in glorious full color too, containing the character build process, player-specific rules and oodles of advice on how to play the various core character types presented (you don't get 'em all, but the ones you do get are the classics, the White Box D&D; + Greyhawk set - Fighter, Cleric, Rogue and Wizard).You get a double-sided wet/dry-erase ready laminated map on which to display your tactical situations. One side pre-printed with detail, the other an earth tone blank with grid.You get a complete set of poly dice.You get three sheets of punch-out standees (cardboard tokens showing the monster/character it represents, drawn to 29mm scale and compatible with most ranges of figures). I wish we'd had these when I was first getting started. I'd have save a fortune in lead and storage would have been so much easier.You get a bag of stands to clip the card token into.You get a team of four pre-generated characters. If your game group is absolutely brand new to RPGs I can't think there is a better product out there for you: not only do they give you the rules, dice and figures, you don't even have to make the characters at first!There's even a solo adventure so you can see how it all works before you try and run a game for your friends.I'm an experienced GM and I liked the look of it all so much I bought the set from my Local Friendly Game Store. I'm going to run the contents for people too.Recommended, especially for beginning RP gamers."
0,1,"Love The game Pathfinder Adventure Card Game.. my son and I play this game all the time and this Expansion does not disappoint.. Highly recommend this deck.. Fun to play thru  and am looking forward to more expansions.. Great card quality, if you like the game Pathfinder adventure card game then stop reading this and buy it.."
0,1,"From the moment my oldest son (9) saw this in the box, I was surprised at the wide-eyed joy he took in every facet of it's operation.By the time I had gotten the dishes done and made lunches for the next day, he had it out of the box and was already programming it.Programing is a bit tedious, especially at first. But besides giving a few programming tips, and few hints on creating chart of standard distances in the house to avoid needed to constantly remeasure, he has done it entirely on his own.My youngest son (5) loves to help, mostly this involves helping measure the distances , and clapping with glee when the robot does what it is supposed to.The robot is quite slow, but hopefully that helps it conserve batteries.Given my oldest's interest in robotics and my desire to see him learn programming as he grows up, this is probably the best toy I could have gotten him at the moment. It is teaching him to think logically, look at tasks as segments, and to plan ahead, all very good skills.With school out for the past couple of days they have had a good chance to use it over the past week and so far it has been their favorite thing to do, even over playing the Wii.I have a few challenges I plan to give him in the future to keep his interest in this toy, but for now , I haven't needed to do anything at all."
1,0,"The Smart Lab programmable Rover has much to recommend it - it's programmable, it records and plays sounds, it is really kind of cool!  On the other hand, though, it's slow, not particularly ""tough"" (durable), and does not give instant feedback.I suggest that it is a good toy for a kid to take the first steps towards learning computer programming, because it is clearly different than a ""remote control"" toy.  When I first ran it down the hall, my boys wanted to know how I was driving it!  Like a computer program, you write the program, and then run it to test it - without the instant feedback of a remote control toy.  And my seven year old had no problem programming it, after just two minutes of instruction from me.  In that respect, I recommend it as educational!Unfortunately, that also makes it less fun as a toy.  It would be better if it drove FASTER, but top speed is really pokey - I'd estimate about 15 feet per minute - so it requires a lot of patience to wait to watch what it's going to do next.  Also, while it isn't particularly loud, it IS too loud for it to sneak up on anyone.  My boys heard it a room away, over the sound of ""Word Girl"" on TV, and came running to see what I was doing.  Finally, ""C"" batteries - is there anything else that still uses that size?So, I have mixed feelings - the Rover is good, but could be a lot better."
0,1,"The Recon Programmable Rover is a robotic-looking unit that runs on 3 c-cell batteries that are not included.  What is included besides the actual rover itself, is a tape-measure & lengthy instruction guide for use when programming the rover to do things.After installing the batteries, you will have to program the unit by following instructions in the manual.  You'll enter voice commands into a recorder and basically learn how to measure distances and paths and send your rover on ""missions.""My 15-year-old daughter had some fun with this unit and didn't seem to mind spending the time it took to program the rover, besides all the measuring that is required when choosing a path or mission.As another reviewer mentioned, this unit is slow moving.  Also, it cannot climb over even simple bumps in the floor, (we have a place where the wood floor changes to tile & there is about a half inch step up and the rover fell over backwards trying to move onto it).Overall, I find the rover to be cute & I acknowledge that it requires users to program it extensively, which is educational to some degree, but I don't see this toy getting much attention after a few sessions of lengthy programming.  The suggestion that you can have it go get you a snack is pretty absurd.  Basically, you can program it to go to a certain spot and if someone is there - and has a lightweight snack to put in his little metal rack - and that person programs him to bring the snack back to the sender or to the home position - if applicable - that's how the snack retrieval idea came about.  It's not exactly a time-saver.  I think having a remote with this rover would be ideal for things like that.This item might be a good gift idea for a child that has a lot of patience & doesn't mind playing alone, programming and experimenting with it.  Otherwise, I see this toy getting dusty on a shelf pretty quickly."

0,1,"I just finished playing my first ever game of Adventurers: Pyramid of Horus, with my two six year old twin boys, my nine year old boy, my thirty year old brother and his thirty one year old friend. Why do the ages matter? Because every single one of us had an absolute blast from six years old all the way up to the thirties. When the game first started off it went at a medium pace but as each round came to a close and another block dropped into the pyramid, blocking the path out, things really began to heat up! The frantic balance between going further into the pyramid for one more treasure versus playing it safe and staying close to the exit for small treasure is perfect. My six year old boys understood the rules and with minimal help were able to manage their own turns. I just can't say enough about how fun and exciting this game was. The quality of the board, miniatures, cards and accessories was top notch but I expect nothing less from Fantasy Flight games. By the time the dust settled the entire family had laughed, yelled, jumped out of our seats, shouted with joy and had the greatest fun with a board game we've had in a long time. I highly recommend this game to all ages, if you can handle a little excitement and adventure that is!"
0,1,"This is the updated Fantasy Flights version of HTMF. This game portrays you as a hungry penguin on the hunt for tasty fish. In doing so you must round up your fish before any rival penguins claim it for their own. Your game board per se consist of 40 hexagonal tiles and always changes. Some might complain that this takes awhile to set up, but if you have some help with your other player(s) set up is a breeze. Fantastic game, great price and best of all the WIFE loves it!"
0,1,"My 6/7 year old really liked this game.  It kept him busy to the end.  I believe we will be playing this one often.  So, I do recommend this game.Make sure you put on a nice flat surface because you have to line the blocks of ice evenly."
0,1,A dungeon crawler that is designed well.  This isn't D&D; you can't compare it to that but that being said some of the mechanics are similar to it.  There are no opportunity hits if you walk by monsters like D&D.;  It is a lot of fun I'm a new player and have only played the introduction so far but can't wait to move to the first quest in the campaign.  This comes with some fantastic quests and it will take a long time to go through them all.  You can also download user created quests online which is great for the replay value of the game.  This game consistently gets good reviews -- check boardgamegeek.  You can't go wrong buying it.The only CON I would give is that the rulebook is lacking a few things that my wife and I are still trying clarify.
0,1,"I've generally shied away from miniatures games in the past but as a reasonable human being I love ""Star Wars,"" so I finally broke down and gave this game a shot.  WHY DID I WAIT!!!  This is an amazing game that really does feel like a tactical dogfight between an X-Wing and Tie-Fighters.  The mechanic is wonderful, especially movement.  Between the movement dials and the templates (one of the reasons I took so long picking it up is that I've always made fun of the guys at the game stores with the tape measures- not necessary here!) moving your ships is a simple thing to execute, though an incredible complex maneuver to plan (in a good way) because of all the choices you have to make.  Do you flip a U-turn, putting stress on your ship and limiting your actions?  Do you bank hard right, in the hopes that you'll be out of your opponents firing arc?  Or do you simply push forward, trading space for time in the hopes of circling around later for a more favorable attack vector?  Absolutely brilliant!Once upon a time board games based on movies or TV almost always sucked.  Makers slapped a logo on an inferior product, knowing it would sell with the tie-in alone.  There are still some cases like that today (see the atrocious board game, ""World War Z""), but fortunately game designers are really taking their time these days, working not just to invoke the tie-in's theme, but really trying to present a great mechanic that makes the game fun in its own right.  Take away the ""Star Wars"" theme here and you'd still have a great game.  ""Star Trek: Fleet Captains"" is a another great example of a fun tie-in theme married to a great mechaninc, and I hear that Wizkids is now planning ""Star Trek: Attack Wing,"" a miniatures game which will function in much the same way as ""Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures.""  Looking forward to that as well.Intense, fast-paced, and endlessly FUN, ""Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures"" is simply a great game.  Buy it.  Play it.  Love it."
0,1,"So, this is a star wars game, if you like star wars you will most likely buy this.  If you like playing fun games then this is not the game you want to buy.  I have played it about 5 times and hopefully will never play it again.  At its heart it is a dive rolling game, that is pretty much it.  You roll dice, move your ship along a card board strip and roll the dice again. Yeah, save your money and get King of Tokyo instead, if you are looking for fun in a dice rolling game."
0,1,"I love this game, I saw it on TableTop and the pieces are beautiful! A great game! Highly recommended! :)"
0,1,Awesome expansion. I enjoy this game quite a lot. I am going to keep purchasing these to get into a very big battle eventually!
0,1,"The X-Wing expansion is a nice addition to a fun game. As noted in my other reviews from this line, you can play a few simple and worthwhile games with the core set, but if you want to get the most variety out of the game you'll need some expansions. Because the X-Wing also comes in the core set (which is required to play), it is not 100% necessary to get this expansion set to get the most out of the game. But, there are a few additions, so I'd say it is probably worth getting one of this expansion set for most people (if then, if you want more X-Wings or TIE Fighters I'd just buy extra starter sets to get more bang for your buck).That said, the X-Wing expansion adds two unique pilots that are NOT included in the core set. Pilots include Wedge Antillies (unique) and Garven Dreis (unique). It also includes two generic pilots that come with the core set.Wedge alone makes this expansion worth getting in my opinion, as he is the highest ranked (Level 9) Rebel pilot in the game, with an awesome offensive special ability, ""When attacking, reduce the defender's agility value by 1 (to a minimum of `0').""Garven is a level 6 pilot that also has a very nice special ability, ""After spending a focus token, you may place that token on any other friendly ship at Range 1-2 (instead of discarding it)."" Based on the FAQ that was recently released by FFG, it is possible for him to give a focus token to a ship that already has a focus token (which definitely adds to his value).It also includes several upgrade cards (many, but not all, of which are also available in the starter or other expansions). The expansion includes two astromech droids (R5 Astromech, and R5-K6), Expert Handling, and Photon Torpedoes.The expansion also includes all tokens, dials, etc. that you need to use this ship in a game.As noted in all of my reviews of FFG X-Wing products, all the ships look great. However, the X-Wing seems particular fragile because of its thin guns. I've played about a dozen games and haven't had any problems with any ship breaking so far. I am not rough with the ships, but I am not overly careful with them either (except perhaps when storing them)."
1,0,"This ship is probably one of the most important ships for the rebel side in the game, and almost all competitive rebel squadron lists have at least one, in fact the world champion used two X-wings and two B-wings. It does come in the Core Set bu this expansion has some very nice cards that add to the lethality of the X-wing. Mostly the usefulness is the two named pilots Wedge and Garvin, both are good with Wedge being the more useful of the two. The upgrades are decent with the highlights being the Astromechs.Whether it comes from this expansion, the Core Set, or the Rebel Transport the X-wing is a good ship, but all come with the different pilots that make it a great ship and I recommend picking up this expansion especially if you want to fly rebels."

It reads, ""When attacking from outside the defender's firing arc, roll 1 additional attack die.""""Howlrunner"" is a level  8 pilot with the following special ability, ""When another friendly ship at Range 1 is attacking with its primary weapon, it may reroll 1 attack die.""It also includes two upgrade cards (both of which are also included in or other expansions): Swarm Tactics (definitely worth having several of this one), and Determination.The expansion also includes all tokens, dials, etc. that you need to use this ship in a game.As noted in all of my reviews of FFG X-Wing products, all the ships look great, but some of them appear to be fragile.

0,1,"For anyone who likes board games, miniature games or Sci Fi in general or Star Wars in particular, this is a great, fun, simple game that can be a beer 'n' pretzels affair or deeply tactical if you want it to be.The presentation and build of the models and included card stock pieces is first rate. The packaging protective and re-usable and the delivery I received from Amazon was super speedy.Even though it is more economical to get another starter set and get 2 TIE fighters as well as another X-Wing, you should get one of these to get the additional Imperial pilots that come with it."
0,1,"This is another very nice addition to a fun game. As noted in my other reviews for this line, you can play a few simple and worthwhile games with the core set, but if you want to get the most variety out of the game you'll need a few expansions (maybe more if you really like the game). I highly recommend this Y-Wing expansion for reasons outlined below.The Y-Wing expansion adds a ship and four pilots that are NOT included in the core set. Pilots include ""Dutch"" Vander (unique), Horton Salm (unique), Gold Squadron Pilot (generic), Gray Squadron Pilot (generic).""Dutch"" Vander is a level 6 pilot with a very nice special ability, ""After acquiring a target lock, choose another friendly ship at Range 1-2. The choose ship may immediately acquire a target lock.""Horton Salm is a a level 8 pilot with one a particularly great offensive ability, ""When attacking at Range 2-3, you may reroll any of your blank results.""It also includes several upgrade cards (most of which are unique to this expansion), including two astromech droids (R5 Astromech, and R5-D8), plus Proton Torpedoes and Ion Cannon Turret.The Ion Cannon is a fun upgrade and the main reason to add a Y-Wing to your squad, but unfortunately the Y-Wing isn't really worth taking unless you also pay extra points for this upgrade (often usually worth it, though, especially since this adds a lot of variety to the game).The expansion also includes all tokens, dials, etc. that you need to use this ship in a game.All the ships look amazing, and while some are more fragile than others none of mine have broken after a dozen or so games. I am not rough with the ships, but I am not overly careful with them either (except perhaps when storing them)."
0,1,"I have heard of the concept of a Living Card Game (from here on called an LCG), but i was always kind of deterred for one reason or another. I did not like the theme, the game had been out for too long, and in order to get into it I would have to spend too much etc..., But then this game came out. I am a huge Star Wars fan and was immediately interested in this. So I went online did some research on the game and found out that it plays similar to another card game called Legend of the Five Rings (L5R). I loved that game, but again could not really afford to keep dropping money into a CCG. SO i picked this game up, and loved it games are not too long the rules are not over complicated. The first few games will take a little bit longer, but that is just because you are still learning. There are a few minor drawbacks though. When playing as the Darkside your ultimate goal is to get your Death Star (dial which goes up by either one or two each round) to 12 to win. This does put a timer on the game, but that is not that big a deal. The other issue is that the Smugglers and Spies and Scum and Villainy factions are almost non existant in the starter game, but that issue was resolved by the Edge of Darkness expansion. Even with these minor issues the game is not bad and for me personally scratched an itch that has been needed for quite some time, and with the newest force packs they are including characters from the extended universe."
1,0,I enjoyed the first Fortress America a long way time ago. This is a nice redone edition. However I have played it once and my gaming group has not tried it again yet. I would play again but others aren't as interested.
1,0,"I remember playing Milton Bradley's &#34;Fortress America&#34; as a kid in the 1980s when it was part of their Gamemaster series, the same series of games that originally brought us &#34;Axis & Allies.&#34;  I remember loving the theme and the idea of a world war taking place on American soil.  About the same time the film &#34;Red Dawn&#34; came out, and &#34;Fortress America&#34; seemed like that game in a box.  Now, Fantasy Flight Games has released an updated version of the old Milton Bradley game.  Like all of Fantasy Flight Games' titles, &#34;Fortress America&#34; looks amazing.  Beautiful game board, detailed figures, and great components are brought to this great theme.  I was expecting to really enjoy this game and picked it up not long after if came out.Fantasy Flight Games' &#34;Fortress America&#34; is not a bad game by any means, but, frankly, its unbalanced.  In the games I've played the American player has not only never won, he never even came close.  The game calls for the American player to wisely use his lasers and partisans, but if the luck of the dice or draw isn't with him, those advantages don't really count for much.  It almost feels as though Fantasy Flight Games didn't quite play test it enough; they simply acquired the title and focused far more on the aesthetics than on the mechanics.  It's been a while since I played this game, and I keep thinking I ought to give it another go.  I probably will somewhere down the line, but too often it seems like there are just other games I'd rather play."
0,1,"If you ever play the game you will find several scenarios where extra dice are invaluable. Not much to say otherwise, but I highly recommend picking an extra set of dice up for your personal armada."
0,1,same high quailty produce as in core box set. very helpful in game play.allows both players to have a set of dice.
0,1,"The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong, but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)We love the different rules for each player, and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly, I usually loose, but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed."
0,1,"Honestly one of the best card games I have ever played.  This comes from someone who has dabbled in Magic the Gathering since the 90s and has played a dozen different customizable card games over the last two decades.  The mechanics are solid and the quality of the cards is exceptional.  The only negative I have for the game is that the symbols and layouts of the cards is a bit poor making it difficult to quickly sort out a stack.  This is a minor annoyance for an otherwise amazing game (but still something I hope they fix in the future).A lot of people ask me why I think this game is so great and almost always I point to the asymmetrical play between the Corp and Runner players.  Both sides work off separate mechanics and there is a constant sense of mystery of what lies ahead as the Corp player plays and discards many of their cards face down.  This opens up a lot of player skill in bluffing (for the Corp) and deductive reasoning (for the Runner).  Most games will come down to mathematical fact in the end but the journey to get there is filled with ups and downs as each card is exposed.I can't recommend this game enough to anyone that is serious about their card games.  The theme is spot on, the mechanics are solid, and the balance of the core set is solid.  Add in a few add on packs and this is really an amazing experience."
1,0,You work together to slay the monster at the end. Strategy is a key role in this game. I recommend this game to anyone who loves mystery.
0,1,"I stand by the above headline, but I'll add just a bit for the sake of appearances.  First of all, Fantasy Flight Games' &#34;Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures&#34; is a brilliant minis game that weds its fantastic theme to an amazingly fun game mechanic.  The Falcon brings a lot to every game.  For starters, she's got a 360 degree firing arc, meaning she can hit anything around it provided its in range.  This gives her a major advantage in combat, though makes maneuvering no less important- It's easy to accidentally fly her off the play area if you're not careful.  The various cards are fun, though I find almost always play with Han Solo, because, hey, he's Han Solo (and he's got a pretty cool ability as well).  The secondary cards also bring a lot to this game, heightening the fun.  Really, if you can only get one expansion to the base game- you shouldn't' have gotten the base game to begin with.  That said, the Falcon is probably the best of the expansions so far, certainly of the larger expansions.  But then, hopefully, you already know this."
0,1,"You know you want this ship. When people think of Star Wars ships only two come readily to mind, the X-Wing and the YT-1300.Get it, fly it, love it."
0,1,This is a beast 360 firing arc. Also a good support ship and keep it moving.  Upgrade and mod cards are great.
0,1,Great addition to the core game. I use the expansion packs to make the combat scenario's more complex and I also use them to increase the number of people playing the game.
0,1,Fun addition to the imperials. with great upgrade cards. The only thing giving this a 4 instead of 5 is that you really need to press hard to fully extend the wings. Everytime I do so I am worried I will break something. The other thing is that the small mini pin that connects to the larger pins and subsequently the base came out right away. I have never had any problems with these ships until wave 3 now I am having all sorts of pin issues.
0,1,"Let's start out with the positives, great model, nice paint job. This model should pivot or roll like the ship would. They even placed it at an angle in the display packaging, but on the stand it forms a T."
0,1,"One thing about this ship is, it comes from the EU, specifically the Dark Forces games. Even though the scale is &#34;correct&#34; it looks a touch too small compared to the other ships. That said, the included cards are really good."
0,1,"Stop me if you've heard this before, but Fantasy Flight Games has done it again.  ""Eldritch Horror"" takes all the things you loved about ""Arkham Horror,"" streamlines them, adds some cool, intuitive new rules, widens the scope, and significantly condenses playing time.  This game also reminds me quite a bit of Flying Frog Production's ""Fortune & Glory.""  I don't know if I'll play F&G; ever again.At its heart, ""Eldritch Horror"" is a story telling game.  Players search the globe for clues in order to solve mysteries that will prevent an Elder God from coming back to Earth to destroy humanity.  In each location they visit they encounter ghouls or smaller mysteries, usually requiring them to roll dice equal to their specific skill set.  Characters also are given the ability to enhance their skills by visiting certain locations.  One of my favorite aspects of the game is how when your character dies, you are not eliminated, you simply select a new character to play.  Your original character does not just disappear however- he becomes an encounter and your new character or someone else may attempt to gain their fallen comrade's clues and assets.  It's really a cool mechanic that I haven't seen before, and adds to the thrilling, grand narrative.If you like grand adventure games and enjoy a fun, horror theme, you really need to get your hands on ""Eldritch Horror.""  I'm already jazzed thinking about what future expansions will bring to this wonderful game!"
1,0,"The board consists of a map of the world in old parchment color tones. Once you setup the board with your character standees, other world gates, monsters, and clue tokens, you get a sense of the adventure you're about to embark on. If you can get behind the below, this game is perfect for your gaming group:- Cthulhu / Lovecraft enthusiasts, or Arkham Horror board game enthusiasts- A small amount of setup but thematic rules make it easy to learn how to play- No plastic miniatures and few dice, but a lot of cards which contain the meat of your adventure- Ultimately a storytelling game through card play and strategy discussion amongst the players- Lots of fun and immersive mechanisms in the game such as having your investigators go insane or defeated, fighting monsters, going to other worlds, encountering and dealing with personal conditions/setbacks, improving skills and gaining items and allies.- Long game of about 3 hours with 4 players and even longer with the full 8 player game"
0,1,"Originally posted on [url][...][/url], a new idea everyday![b]Game[/b]-Eldritch Horror[b]Producer[/b]-Fantasy Flight[b]Price[/b]- $60[b]Set-up/Play/Clean-up[/b]- 3 Hours[b]TL;DR[/b]-An awesome addition to the FF Cthulhu line 92.5%[b]Basics[/b]-  The world is under attack!  Creatures from beyond are striking out at our world and bringing the apocalypse with them.  Based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, each player takes the role of an investigator traveling the globe trying to close portals to other worlds, foil fiendish evil plots, and fighting monsters beyond mortal ken.  This game is a world spanning epic sequel to Arkham Horror.[b]Mechanics[/b]-  The game move somewhat quickly.  Each turn, character get two action that among other things can be moving, resting, shopping, or trading.  After that each character encounters events, monsters, or clues on their location.  Each location has its own special deck of cards strengthening then theme of the encounter there.  Finally, a card indicating what events happen next turn is read from the mythos deck.  When the mythos deck runs out, the world is doomed!  To resolve shopping, combat, or encounters, characters start by checking their sheet and look for the appropriate icons to find the number of dice to roll.  After the roll, 5's and 6's count as successes.  For most encounters, one success is needed, but for monsters, you're successes inflict damage as well as prevent damage to yourself.  Monsters also have an additional roll where you must see if your character goes insane from the shear mental trauma of the beyond.  The game moves very quickly as the basic conflict resolution is fast, and the rules a pretty intuitive.  The game does flatten out some of the dice numbers from Arkham Horror, so that was a shock.  I did think some item prices were somewhat high, but all and all the game was fun and that came a lot from the mechanics involved.  4.5/5[b]Theme[/b]- The theme of cosmic horror comes out pretty well.  Each monster has a deck of events/quests you have to solve to prevent the end of the world.  If enough bad things happen, the ancient one awakens and then there is another event to deal with on the back of the ancient one.  This deck specific for each ancient evil really does make the game that much more focused.  The general mythos deck that makes bad things happen/timer is a little to general, but all and all I really did feel like I was working against one specific cosmic horror.  The monsters are a bit of a mix.  Monsters are still random, which isn't bad, but it does mean you will fight stuff that by the Lovecraft mythos really doesn't belong when you are fighting a different ancient evil.  That does take away from a bit of the focus.  However, I did that some monsters are special.  We had a zombie that became the special zombie hoard.  That little touch made the game that much more memorable.  The same goes for the mix of encounter cards you get.  Instead of a focused game against one cosmic being, you get a bit of a mix.  However, it's not bad, just not the game I hoped for. 4/5[b]Instructions[/b]- The instructions are well written.  I had no questions on how to play.  I did have some minor questions regarding specific in game events, but POOF FAQ up before I even opened the box.  High quality too.  I hate when a FAQ doesn't look like it belongs with the game.  Also, the instructions are ONLINE in pdf BEFORE the game was released! 5/5[b]Execution[/b]- This is Fantasy Flight, so instant 5/5  The parts of the game are amazing.[b]Summary[/b]- This game wasn't the exact game I wanted, but it is close enough.  Arkham Horror had a bit of a focus problem.  This game fixes a lot of that but not completely.  I did have a great time and can't wait to play again.  I want cosmic specific encounters across the board (mythos deck, region encounter decks etc), but I know that would have made this game that much more expensive and would have required about five times as many parts.  I've liked what I saw and can easily recommend this to anyone who's looking for a world spanning Lovecraft adventure.  92.5%"
1,0,"I haven't really gotten to play this with many people yet, mostly as a single player board game, but it is great as single player. The game is pretty brutal and if you do manage to win a solo game or even a game with other people, you will feel like you accomplished something. The flavor of the game is great and does a good job telling a story for each character. A cool aspect of the game is that when your character dies or goes insane, you can still come across their bodies and &#34;encounter&#34; them as a ghost or crazy person. I think that's a neat idea and it works really well in this game. I've never played Arkham Horror, which came before this so I can't speak how it compares to that, but I really enjoy this game."
0,1,"I have a page on Facebook dedicated to AMC's best hit series, The Walking Dead. I did a caption contest and this was one of the prizes. When I got it in the mail while the contest was going on, I noticed it was nicely packaged and in excellent shape. I definitely recommend this rather you are buying it for yourself or someone else."
0,1,"...but I just don't.  It is so boring and kind of...  I don't know...  difficult?  My son and I played it a few times and the games were so brief and we had to keep cheating to keep the games going that it just got to be a drag.  Maybe with more people?  I will say that the quality of the product is outstanding.  The box and all the contents are well made and the makers certainly did not cheap out on that in any way.  Just a tough game to play with two people.  So, three stars for a well made product, zero for fun."
0,1,"The Walking Dead board game is a tragic example of the difference between theory and practice. In theory, the idea of a board game in which players who get bitten continue to play as zombies should be an exciting and nerve-wracking way to spend an evening with friends. In practice, the rules are cumbersome, artificially complicated, and don&#8217;t take into account people who will deliberately get bitten just to screw up the game for everyone else.There are six character cards to choose from: Andrea, Dale, Glenn, Lori, Rick, and Shane (no Daryl or Michone!). Each character has its own strengths and weaknesses.  Though there are six cards, the game is designed for only four players. As you advance through the game, you try to find supplies and fight off zombies. The game mechanic relies on a six-sided die, which you roll against the zombie&#8217;s abilities to see if you are successful. In far too many cases, you can&#8217;t survive a zombie encounter unless you roll a five or a six. The reason for this is that zombie encounters are completely random, so you can end up facing the toughest zombies right out the gate before you&#8217;ve had a chance to even get any weapons or supplies.As a point of comparison, imagine trying to fight a Deathclaw in Fallout 3 as soon as you exited Vault 101.  There is a fine line between &#8220;challenging&#8221; and &#8220;destined to fail no matter what you do.&#8221;Characters that are killed don&#8217;t drop out of the game. Instead, they become zombies and can join forces against the survivors. Imagine if in Monopoly players who lost all of their money could continue playing as gangsters or bank robbers (admit it, you are now working out alternative rules in your head to allow this). This should be fun and allow players to continue to enjoy the game even if they get killed early on. But it isn&#8217;t fun in The Walking Dead because the zombies are overpowered in relation to the characters.The production value of the game is high. Some board game traditionalists may not like the fact that the board isn&#8217;t an actual solid particle board but rather a vinyl board, but it&#8217;s a cool design and not flimsy at all (though it is a bit small for four players). All of the parts are made of high quality card stock so the cards don&#8217;t bend or tear with normal use. Even if the game&#8217;s actual entertainment value is low, the collectible value is apparent.This item was purchased as a present for a big fan of the series, and she was happy.  I almost wish we hadn&#8217;t opened it. Unopened, it will probably be worth something years from now.On its own merits, the game is only two stars, but I&#8217;m giving it three because of the collectible value and the fact that a dedicated fan could tweak the rules to make the game more entertaining."
1,0,My teenager loves this game and plays with his friends regularly.  It's hard to find gifts for teens and this is a great alternative to video games for walking dead fans.
0,1,"This game is laid out simply enough, all you need to do is collect the cards at the four corners and avoid turning into a zombie in the process. It takes some strategy though. ""Do I want this bonus or this one?"" ""Do I go forward or double back?"" The other cool thing is that your role in the game switches when you lose a battle to a zombie (roll a die and get a number less than the number on their card). Upon becoming Zombified, your new goal becomes making your teammates meet the same fate. Fantastic game, even cooler that it's based off the show."
0,1,My teenager really had a good time making these things and he actually learned a thing or two so everyone is happy
0,1,sent 2 as gifts & the kids really liked them! I did the first experiment w/my g-son& it was a great learning eyes-on & hands-on experiment about how we can get clean water!
0,1,Fluxx is one of my favorite games to bring out with non-gamers.  Everyone that I've played it with has loved it and wanted to keep playing over and over.  You can't go wrong with this one.
0,1,Great game. It makes for a really good gift to someone and the whole family can play it. Very great game.
0,1,"I love the Fluxx series so much, and you can't go wrong with the original!Fluxx is the perfect go-to game if you want something fast-paced, fun and easy to learn.  Because the explanation and basic rules of the game are so simple, I've found that it's equally fun for brand-new players as for those who've played it before.  Everything is explained on each card, so you can give very minimal instructions to new players and they'll pick it up easily.  We usually use this as a warm-up game on game nights with friends and family, before moving on to more strategy-based games.Since I mentioned strategy, I will give you one word of caution: this is not a game for those who are looking for something with elaborate strategy and get frustrated when the plan they've been working on for several rounds either doesn't work out or backfires.  The nature of the game is to be ever-changing, so you have to be willing to go with the flow.  You can have some strategy, of course, but you have to be willing to see it blow up in front of you in seconds--and then laugh about it!A word about the theme versions of the game: I own several of the other versions (Monty Python Fluxx, Star Fluxx, Oz Fluxx, Zombie Fluxx), and this is the version I play with either new players or when I have a mixed group of people in terms of their familiarity with some of the other themes.  Monty Python Fluxx, for example, is best played by a group of MP lovers--this can be played by anyone, and they'll get the references and the humor!"
0,1,"This game uses the original Fluxx rules, and thrusts them squarely into a zombie theme -- and, surprisingly, it works very, very well.  The game play is relatively straightforward: (1) collect ""keeper"" cards in front of you while avoiding zombie cards, (2) play ""global"" cards that change the rules of the game, (3) attempt to collect the right combination of ""keeper"" cards to satisfy the ever-changing goal conditions.This game can be played as a standalone set and is also compatible with any of the Fluxx sets, although I've found that the game play is usually a bit stilted and less enjoyable with other sets mixed in.Each card contains its own set of rules that affect game play, so each card contains (often substantial) text.The game is fairly flexible in terms of the number of players it can accommodate, but somewhere between 3-5 is probably best. If you stick to those numbers, a game will usually take around 15-30 minutes. (2 player games are generally not much fun).Overall, the game is portable, fast-paced, and often amusing.APPROPRIATE AUDIENCE: Hardcore gamers will enjoy this as a ""warm-up"" between their more complicated gaming sessions. It's also a very useful tool for introducing newcomers to these kinds of games.Finally, this particular set is, of course, zombie themed -- in other words, if the player doesn't enjoy zombie jokes, you are better off getting a different set of Fluxx cards (Star Fluxx for sci-fi fans, Cthulhu Fluxx for Lovecraft fans, etc).OVERALL SCORE: B- The game is a lot of fun, but can get tedious if played too often."
0,1,"another fluxx card game. haven't played this version yet but got it for the boys.slow learning and getting into it, but when you do, it is fun. like that you can add cards."
0,1,"A fun version of the Fluxx card game that I would definitely buy again. Lots of wacky combinations of alien technology and weird rules. Fluxx is always a challenge due to its ever-changing rules, goals and actions. Be prepared to laugh a lot with this one, even if it's only two of you playing."
0,1,"I have several of fluxxs games, this is one of the other fun fluxx to play with. we are those aliens try to destroy humans. hahah."
0,1,"When I was a child we loved Uno because back then that was the best card game out there for children. Games have come a long way since then. This is an example of that fact.Family Fluxx is a wonderful card game for elementary school aged children. I've played it with my children (5 and 8) and with 5th grade students. My own children enjoy the game and think this is how a card game should play (having never been really exposed to Uno). My students, who knew nothing other than UNO before they played this were astonished and ecstatic over it.In Fluxx games, the rules of the game and the winning conditions are constantly being modified by the players. The game starts with the default rules of draw one card and play one card. Players then start laying down cards from their hand to change those rules. It could change to draw 4 cards and play all cards, for example. There are also goal cards which show two pictures on them. These two pictures match other cards, called Keepers, which have one picture each on them. Keeper cards are placed face up in front of the player from their hand as a possible turn. Players are constantly replacing the current goal card, in addition to the rule cards, in order to attempt to make it match their Keepers. There are also action cards which let players do things like steal Keepers, trade them, or other things.There is a great deal of strategy happening in this game, mixed in with the luck aspect of drawing cards. Far more brain cells are firing in Fluxx than in UNO I'm sure. The fifth graders like the ""Take that!"" aspect of gameplay, of course. My own younger children like working out their plans to get the right Keepers.Family Fluxx is the easiest of the Fluxx games to learn. But I wouldn't attempt it with a child younger than a very bright 5 year old who is reading comfortably. It should be good for most children 7 and up.Family Fluxx is a great game for family or classrooms."
0,1,"another fluxx game. all of them are fun but slow to start. you're just learning how to manage changing rules, which is actually part of the fun."
0,1,"Bananagrams is a great game for everyone, kids & adults, who can spell and arrange words cross-word style.  And it doesn't matter how many different levels of readers / spellers are playing.  Since you're creating your own board, you're competing against yourself.With it's yellow banana-shaped carrying bag, Bananagrams stows in your purse or backpack to take along everywhere!  I love travel games that still have full-sized playing pieces.All players start with the same number of face-down letters, someone says ""split"" and players begin creating their own Scrabble-style layout with their letters.  When anyone runs out of tiles, she says ""peel"" and everyone draws another tile.  You can always ""dump"" a tile, but you'll have to draw three!  When there are less tiles left than players, the game continues until someone uses all their letters and calls ""Bananas!"" She is the winner... unless someone challenges one of her words.  The dictionary can confirm any ""rotten bananas"" and the rest of the players may a chance at the win.If you need to adjust the difficulty, you could level the playing field: limit stronger players to longer words, or give the weaker players a little extra time at the start of the game.Bananagrams is great fun for adults and kids, mixed age groups, anyone who can spell.  We do keep a dictionary around to double-check those rotten bananas.We LOVE Bananagrams!"
0,1,"As others have said, a bit like Scrabble, without the board and points.I read the negative reviews and simply cannot identify with their criticisms... particularly that adults won't like it.  My husband and I LOOOVE to play against each other and get quite competitive - glancing at each other's words to ensure correct spelling and propriety, speeding up, reworking existing words... In fact, we were introduced to this game by a group of older adults at a family summer camp.  While the children played soccer, we sat at a table and raced to beat each other!That said, my daughter loves the game, too, and she's learned quite a bit in playing.  We always keep two dictionaries nearby - one that is current and Webster's 1812 - and if she has a question about a word, she asks and then uses it in a sentence.  There are always opportunities to learn, for all of us!My favorite way to play is on my own, with a timer.  The possibilities are many.Highly recommended!"
0,1,Great travel game.  Helps teach how to spell and combine words and kids have fun creating their own games out of it since there are really no rules.
0,1,"This game is great for all ages and so easy to take with you where-ever you go.  It can be as fast or slow as you want it to be. My father is in his 80's and is a Cross Word Puzzel whiz and he loves it.  I have grade school grandchildren who love it as well.  It's great to take with you camping or anywhere.  I have adult groups who even keep a set in the car... just in case the chance to play Bananagrams presents itself.  It even has instructions to play it solo. Bananagrams also offers a jumbo size for more players.Bananagrams JumboGreat game - great price and no better place to buy it from, yeah Amazon!Bananagrams"
0,1,"Bananagrams the game is ok, not great.  I guess some people like it, but it's not my cup of tea.  What this is to me is a great set of tiles in a portable bag.  I use the tiles to play another game, Snatch-It.  Snatch-It is a much better game than Bananagrams, but it comes with terrible tiles.  They're harder to read, and there's not nearly enough vowels.  Buy Bananagrams, buy Snatch-It, use the Bananagrams tiles with the rules from Snatch-It."
0,1,We made up some of our own rules and enjoyed playing Bananagrams more then. The first one to use up all their first 21 tiles is the winner.The game is way too long otherwise.
0,1,Bananna Grams are made well. The tiles are a hard plastic and the zippered pouch makes it easy to store and/or travel with. It's a fun game and it helps kids learn to think better and improves their spelling.
1,0,"This game can be compared to a live crossword puzzle without the clues.  It is also similar to Scrabble, but much much better and more fun!  The games do not take very long because the first one finished wins!  No complicated scoring or turn sequence.  The letter tiles are built to last, and the banana bag is durable enough to hold the tiles for the life of the game.  A great game to exercise the brain!"
0,1,"All of the ""10 Days"" games are fun, and 10 Days in the Americas is no exception.  A new area to explore (North, Central & South America and the Caribbean) and a new twist (""cruises"", in which you can string together sequences of oceans) make this a great addition to the series."

0,1,I purchased this for my 5 year old daughter for her birthday. She is fascinated by the human anatomy and plans on being a doctor. She loves taking him apart and putting him back together. My only complaint is that the scissor tweezers broke coming out of the box.
1,0,"My daughter loves this! All of the organs are squishy and sticky which kids love..anything to making learning FUN!! The tweezers and pieces used to pick up organs are a little flimsy, but other than that this is great quality. It has lots of education materials with it to explain what everything does. May be a little hard for a younger child to put the body back together."
0,1,"Simple game once you learn the rules and play for 5-10 minutes.  Each tile has one of six shapes, in one of six colors, five tiles in their hand.  Each turn players can place (or trade in) their tiles.  If you place, you must place tiles so that you form a row of either:  (1) same color tiles, with no shape repeating (meaning the maximum row size is six); (2) same shape tiles, with no color repeating.  You get 1 point for the length of the row formed.  For example, if you add two tiles to a row that was 3 tiles placed by another player, you would get 5 points.  As long as you place tiles in a straight line and obey the above rules, you can form more than 1 row, and get points for all.  For example, if you add a tile to the end of a row of 3, you get 4 points for that, and if you place a tile below the 4th tile in that row (the one you added) you get another 2 points for that new 2 you created.  In other words, the scoring works like scrabble, in that as long as you place your tiles in a row, you can form more than one scoring line -- more than 1 ""word"" in scrabble terms.  If you form a color row with all six shapes, or a shape row with all six colors, you get 12 points, not 6 - that is called a ""quirkle.""Sounds complicated but its not.  As long as an adult is keeping score, kids as young as 5 (maybe even 4) can pick this up.  In my house, my kids being 6 & 9, we find it most fun to play 2 v 2, with everyone having their own hand, with team members seeing their teammates hand and jointly planning strategy.  While this is mostly because the 6 year old would not be competetive on his own -- and he hasnt learned to like games he always loses -- team play actually does add to the level of strategy.  My six year old can sometimes spot plays that I miss.There is easily enough strategy that a strategic minded adult would almost always beat a non-strategically minded adult, and that adults will always beat kids in solo play, but team play with teams of adult + kid fixes this problem.  While it may not be strategically deep enough for the very serious strategy gamer, its a total winner for everyone else."
1,0,"Qwirkle is a very simple, yet very fun game!  Kind of like a cross between matching and dominoes.  What I really like is that you can play it with almost any number of players, and even relatively young children (such as my six-year-old) can play competitively."
0,1,"I love this game so I purchased it for my grandson for Christmas.  I haven't had the chance to play the game with him yet so I don't know if it was a good fit for him.  I think as the newness of his other gifts wears off, he'll turn to this game."
0,1,"My six-year-old daughter and I have played this game a few times since receiving it.  It is **Fun **Challenging **A great way to spend time together **Easier yet more challenging than Scrabble!  As a Scrabble lover, I understand that it can be frustrating for younger cutie pies to keep up without getting frustrated (with Scrabble).  This game has a similar premise: creating a grid by building or adding onto rows - in this game: of color or shape.  Starting a new row or finding a way finish an existing row of shapes or color (&#34;Qwirkle!&#34;) really makes you use your thinker BUT it's very fun so the mental challenge is greatly rewarded with lots of smiles and high-fives :)  We have yet to use the scoring system...  We just like the challenge of tile arranging!"
0,1,Purchased this for our 6 year old.  tried to play it once.  the instructions were too difficult to understand and play.  getting rid of it today.
0,1,"This is a very innovative game which is simple and complex at the same time. Initially it appears simple but in order to score big, excellent strategy and analysis is needed. This can be enjoyed by all ages."
0,1,"We got this for our 7 year old daughter this past Christmas and she loves it!  In fact, we all love this game.  It took her a few games to realize the strategy part of it, but now that she's figured that out, she seriously kicks butt playing this!  She absolutely loves to yell ""Qwirkle"" and has become rather skilled at getting them!  She asks to play this game every day.  Even my {almost} two year old enjoys sitting and matching the shapes and colors {with supervision of course}.  We had our neighbors over one evening and they and their eight year old loved it so much they went out and bought it the next day.  It's no wonder this game has received its awards and excellent rating ... This truly is a fun and educational game for ALL ages. If your family is into playing games, other than video, I highly recommend getting Qwirkle."
0,1,I bought this for my nephew for a gift.  He loved it.  Its great to challenge the mind.

0,1,"It is hard to find a game for kids and adults to play together, but this game is great!  It is challenging and educational for kids.  I played it with a 5 year old and 8 year old and they both loved it and only needed a few reminders of the rules.  It teaches patterns, and is very fun.  It is really well made too, nowadays most things are so cheap but this game is wonderful.  A great game to purchase for a family!"
0,1,"I can totally see why this game was endorsed by Mensa. I bought this for my 5-year old's birthday and we just opened the box. The pieces are very nicely made, and feel high quality. It took some time teaching my son how to play the game, but he eventually picked up the basics. While it is a simple concept, there are definitely strategies that can be enacted to make this game more complicated and technical than it looks. For this reason, I believe that it would be enjoyable for a range of ages, from 5 to 100+."
0,1,Fun game for the whole family. The only thing I don't like about this game is the extensive recording of points on paper. I feel like this aspect could have been better integrated in the game itself. It's really annoying to constantly keep track of score on a piece of paper after each person plays tiles. Otherwise a good and fun game!
0,1,"NOT SUCH A FUN GAME, UNLESS WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY, BUT SO FAR, WITH ABOUT 3 VERSIONS THAT WE HAVE TRIED, IT ISN'T ALL THAT GREAT."
1,0,"I bought this game for my boys, 9 and 4.  I wanted something fun that the whole family could play together... which is sometimes difficult to find since the youngest can't read yet.  I wasn't sure if this would be too hard or not for the 4-year-old, but he seemed to catch on pretty fast and he really enjoyed it!  Now and again he would ask for help, but that didn't seem to bother him, since he actually got to play by himself and didn't have to be on anyone's ""team"".  Anyway a couple of the other adults who played this game liked it so much they're going to purchase it themselves.  It really is fun!"
0,1,I bought it for my six year old grandson who loved it & we loved playing with him as well. A game for the entire family.
0,1,Had a family night with this one...Pros:Lots of InstructionsShort and Longer gameplay on gameboardCons:ConfusingHave not heard of many of the filmsBoring and Loses interest because most of the stuff has never been seen before even though we watch tons of movies and tvShort review but I say pass on this one!
0,1,"We got this for the family before our first trip to Disneyland (we've been to Disney World several times, but never Disneyland).  It was a fun way to get into the spirit and see Disney hidden gems that we had missed before.  Not being the biggest Disney movie fans out there, we didn't fare very well in the game, but we all had fun.  This was also our first Scene-It game, but I think we'll get the Star Trek one now, since that's more up our alley.Another positive for a family game is that you can play this in about 30 minutes.  This isn't a marathon board game that sucks all the fun out of the game over the hours (I'm looking at you Monopoly!).  Its just right for a family game."
0,1,"As the wife of a youth minister, I have gotten sucked into all sorts of teen-obsessions.  I always take a group to see whatever Twilight movie is newly released.  It is always fun.  This game offers another way to get my girls to interact."
0,1,"I guess it was because I told the boys that girls liked Twilight because Edward was the 'perfect' boyfriend....but after that, my teen boys, 14 and 15, started studying the Twilight movies like they were some magickal text.  They swear that they HATE Twilight, but couldn't wait to dive into this game when I got it.The game is hard, but it's fun for them, and I play it too. I  really liked the books, and I'd think I'd have an advantage, but I don't seem to, as I never win. There's a lot about character names.  I'm bad with names.  The puzzles include putting the scenes in order. I really like those.There's a short version and a long version.  The short version takes the 3 of us an hour.  It's a well made game.  Our biggest complaint is the narrator's voice.  It is supposed to be ""Carlisle"" from Twilight but it just sounds like, as my son puts it, ""Some guy sounding fake English.""I've had it 3 weeks now, and it's been played 5 times.  I've no doubt when we have company it will get pulled out again.  This would be GREAT for slumber parties."
0,1,"Scene it? Twilight Saga Deluxe is a fun game for the whole famliy. It will be more fun, however, if you have watched the movies. There were a lot of different scenes not seen before so that made it more fun. The game is very engaging and would recommend it for 10+ as well. I played this with my daughters, and do plan to get more Scene it games in the future."
0,1,"Great game! It was a little harder than we thought. The cards are sometimes ridiculous as in ""Who would EVER know that?"" pretty hard to get. Otherwise it was fun and had a good time watching the scenes from Simpsons."
0,1,"My editorial review:The Rudolf DVD game is geared toward kids, but is a good option for the Rudolf-loving family game night.  If you've played Scene-It, the gameplay and DVD usage is very similar.  Most of the questions and games are pretty easy, and they mirror some of the same types of challenges in Scene-It.  The difficulty is reduced for younger kids.  My 7 and 9 year olds had very few problems playing the game on their own once I had played a couple rounds with them.  Most game-related instructions are both spoken and shown on the screen so that players with limited reading skill can still play.  The time per game is pretty accurate at 30-45 minutes.  It is limited to 4 players, though you could have more than four work as teams to answer the minigame challenges.The object is to collect and return the toys which have been scattered across the land.  You roll a die to move your character onto a toy-token, then successfully win the on-screen minigame to collect that token.  Collect 3 tokens of different colors to win.  At the same time, the Bumble (which is controlled by the game) is also trying to steal the toys.  If he steals 6 before any player collects 3, the game is over.  Therefore, the gameplay is a mix of board-based movement and on-screen games and instructions.As an adult, I really appreciate that all the graphics, characters, and scenes are from the original movie.  They did a good job of keeping the look of the game consistent with the original rather than resorting to computer-graphics likeRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer & the Island of Misfit Toys.  The packaging is nice and everything fits well back into the box.  I would have liked a plastic jewel case for the dvd rather than a cardboard sleeve, though.Overall, the kids like playing it, and it's as enjoyable a flashback for my wife and I to watch and play along or help our kids with some of the answers.  I might not pay the full $20 for it, but at a reasonable discount it would be a good purchase in my mind.Quick assessment:Overall, I think the game is worthy of 3 stars - It's ok.  I like it, and it has potential for a better rating, but there's some gameplay issues.Good points:-All original graphics and scenes (except for the game narrator).-Gameplay suitable for kids on their own-Difficulty applicable to the age range-No reading required for young playersAreas of improvement:-Gameplay speed-Not a lot of strategy or depth-No freeplay or quickplay mode-Instructions not entirely clearDetails behind my opinion and rating:To be 4 stars:The game mechanics need improved.The DVD menu layout should match the game board.  I suspect they rearranged it so that you could easily tell whether to press up/down/left/right on the DVD remote.  To make the screen match the board would mean the regions are in the 4 corners of the screen, meaning you'd need to potentially press in two directions to get to the correct region rather than just one click.  Even so, the screen doesn't have the regions in the same order as the board.The number of toys the Bumble steals should go from 0 at the bottom to 6 at the top.In the voice instructions, it says ""Move the Bumble's counter up"".  It means ""up by one number"", but on the game board the numbers increase as you move the counter down.  Only slightly confusing, but for kids, everything should be more clear to avoid mistakes.Add full audio setup instructions with an option to repeat the last message.When setting up for the first time, neither the DVD nor the instructions have the full setup and gameplay procedure.  It takes a combination of the two to do it right.  Once you've played a couple of times, it's easy to understand, but it's frustrating for the first few rounds.  Additionally, there's no option to repeat the instruction last given, so if you miss it, you're stuck figuring it out on your own.  Once you select an option, there's no ""undo"".  So if you select the wrong region, or accidentally say you've collected 3 toys, the game doesn't give you a chance to correct your mistake.For 5 stars:Speed up the gameplay.The transitions between actions occurring (Bumble moving, Bumble stealing a toy, and Placing/removing tokens) doesn't flow well.  Often the next person is taking their turn either because the pause is long enough you think you're supposed to, or you're just too impatient to wait for the ""Pass the remote to the next player"" message.  Often, you'll get two or three instructions per turn, meaning it really slows down the gameplay.  My kids didn't seem to mind, but I lost interest after about two games because of how slow it was to get from one turn to another.  Even allowing you to fast-forward the individual instructions would help.Fix gameplay irregularities.The game seems to try and keep track of how many tokens are on the board and where they are, as well as how many token the Bumble has stolen, but it doesn't always seem to work right.  We've found that it sometimes tells you to put a token on a spot that's already occupied.  The instructions aren't clear if you put a second one down or if you don't.  Once we were told the Bumble stole a toy, but in that region there wasn't one on the board.  These might have been our error as well, but it adds to confusion on occasion.  All of these can be played around, but I didn't get the feeling that the game was truly polished and error-free.  Also, it could do a better job of randomly assigning where to put the tokens.  The Bumble sometimes moves to a region that he's already sitting in.  By telling you to put him where he already is makes it a bit confusing and at the very least adds extra time to the gameplay for no reason.  Lastly, on at least one occasion, if the DVD thinks there's no token in the the region in which you've landed on one, it won't let you select that region's minigame.  Therefore, that player can't play a minigame without potentially messing up the token count of other regions.Allow a free-play mode.I'd really like to be able to play the minigames without the board.  If you're a fan of the movie, it's still fun to play the minigames even if they are a bit easy for adults.  It would be nice to have a ""free play"" feature.  This could also let you create a ""quick play"" version that allows 4 people to race to collect all 5 misfit toy tokens of their color by answering questions correctly.In the grand scheme, I do like the game but feel it could have been polished up a bit and it would be much better.  I like the game, but the poor setup procedure, occasional errors in gameplay, and how slow the game progresses are what keep me from giving it a 4-star rating.Other observations:-My contents differ from that in the product description:The ""4 Collectible Figurines/ Movers"" are really just cardboard cutouts with plastic stands.  They're nice, thick cardboard, better quality than those found in many kids' games, but definitely not collectible figurines.It mentions 9 Yukon Cornelius tokens and only 11 misfit toy tokens.  I'm not sure what those are.  We had 20 toy tokens, the single Bumble token, and the player markers.  Maybe the description is referring to a different game or an earlier version.  All the pieces are included to play the game, they are just different than what the product description calls out.  Amazon's review is functionally the same as what I received, though slightly different than what the pictures"
1,0,"DVD games are a real mixed bunch. Sometimes they are good, sometimes they are bad. But when they are bad, they tend to be horrible. My kids really enjoy the little mini-games the come as extras on some movie DVDs, so I thought I would give this game a shot. While it is not the worst game I've ever played, it ranks pretty close.The pacing of this game is just too slow. I got bored, my kids got bored, and in the end we just pushed on to say that we finished. I don't think we even got excited about a winner. Don't get me wrong, I think that if the family sat down to do this as a Christmas chat type activity, it would be better. We just sat down to play it (we were too busy to play during the holidays) and there just wasn't any magic. I think that a game should be fun no matter when you play it, so I am not taking the ""Christmas Magic"" into account in my rating.Overall: If you need a family activity for Christmas time, you could do worse than this. Just do not think that this is a game that you will get out often (or even every Christmas). As with most DVD games, replay value is very limited."
0,1,"If you're a fan of the classic Rankin/Bass TV special, RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER, first of all you should have the ""making of"" book by eminent R/B specialist Rick Goldschmidt as well as the soundtrack album on CD. You'll also enjoy this interactive DVD/board game version though you won't be able to impress anyone with your detailed knowledge of the longest running holiday TV special in history.However, don't let that stop you. The folks who made SCENE IT came up with a colorful, nicely paced game that can be played by young children and adults with no one getting frustrated or bored. And the DVD is not an ancillary part of the game -- you really need it to play along.The narrator, a well-chosen, grandfatherly type who could very well have been in the original cast (though of course he was not), guides you warmly through the proceedings. The story is that the Misfit Toys have scattered and the players must rescue them before Bumbles the Abominable Snowman captures them. The DVD tells you where to place the toys and Bumbles and you choose to be Rudolph, Hermie, Clarice, or Yukon Cornelius.Every time you attempt to rescue a toy, the DVD has a game for you to play, from watching a clip from the film and recalling a detail to guessing which character will win a race. Some are pure chance and others require observational skills.It may be my DVD player, but there was a bit of inconsistency in the time allowed to answer the challenges. Also, it's not clear where to keep the Misfit Toys -- on the image in the game board or off the board -- because the narration contradicts it. When you are standing on a space that the DVD suddenly assigns a toy, do you get to rescue it on your next turn or do you have to leave the space and return later? We decided that since there is no minimum number of spaces to move regardless of the roll of the die, you could stay there and help the toy.The overall design of the game board is lovely and the DVD cleverly manipulates images and audio from the film for various purposes. My only quibble is that there should have been credit given to Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass, since the classic film is their landmark production. I don't care whether it was determined by marketing people that it doesn't matter -- it does, to more people that you think. It might have been nice to offer special thanks to the voice cast and also Anthony Peters, whose art direction graces all of the Rudolph merchandise. Just a nod would be an act of courtesy and respect to great artistry and talent.My son loves the game by the way and wants to make it a holiday tradition."
0,1,"This game works for us sometimes.......and sometimes not.The premise for the game is cute.  We love this movie and watch it several times each Christmas, so when I was offered to try out this game, I jumped at the opportunity. Unfortunately, the game didn't always quite work out the way I was hoping it would. The questions were appropriate for my 5 year old and she always gets excited when she answers one correctly.....but she is an extremely sensitive child.  The way this game works, Bumble has an opportunity to steal presents and once he successfully steals 6 presents, *HE* wins the game. This REALLY upsets my daughter. She doesn't mind losing a game to her mommy or her daddy.....or one of her stuffed animals, as they often play with us.....but she has a serious problem losing to a &#34;bad guy&#34; like Bumble.Overall, this game is kind of cute, but we don't get all that excited about it. It's one of those take-it-or-leave-it kind of games, i.e. if the weather is bad and there is absolutely nothing else to do, we'll drag this game out. But we usually pick just about any other activity (over this game) if given the choice."
0,1,"We are enjoying making sentences for each other.  But when mixed company is over, these are the first to be put away, for obvious reasons.  We're having a blast with them, though.  Thinking I need to order more sets to have more fun, though.  Good set stands on it's own very well."

0,1,Keep your Fluxx play in more flux by adding Star Fluxx or playing it stand-alone. While this is not our favorite theme Fluxx game it mixes well with any of the others and plays well on it's own too. If you've ever played any other Fluxx and have a desire to reach for the stars then this one might just be for you.
1,0,"I'd like to try a couple of the other fluxx games as well, but being a sci-fi geek, had to get this one first. The always-changing rule structure is genius. I only like certain kinds of card games and this definitely makes the list."
0,1,Keeps you on your toes. constantly changing so you don't get bored. Very clever and funny similarities with Star-Geek stuff
0,1,"Since every American kid and quite a few non-American ones are familiar with the Wizard of Oz, this ever-changing card game based on the Oz theme is fun for all ages. Nothing really scary here, just non-threatening, non-competitive family enjoyment. :-D"
0,1,The pictures are awesome and very detailed. I do have to sit with her to work on this as it is a bit of a challenge for my differently able 10 yr old daughter. But she is very proud of the results she gets. Make sure you use sharp color pencils as some of the sections are very small. But I would recommend this product and it's quality.
0,1,"I hadn't played this game before purchasing it, so I was a little nervous that it would be overly complex.  However, it has turned out to be an excellent game.  It is quite complex, but it isn't terribly hard to learn.  The game is about achieving honor for your family in a medieval village.  While I have never been in a medieval village trying to achieve honor for my family, the game does feel very realistic in that respect.  Time is one of the main resources in the game as you go through several generations of family and nearly every action that one takes requires a certain amount of time.  Family members even die over the course of the game, yet somehow the game manages to be fun and lighthearted rather than depressing.  Overall, this is a beautiful, complex (in a good way), challenging resource management game!"
1,0,"The game components are excellent and I love the custom dice.  The cards have good artwork, the counters are thick and double-sided, and the box looks like a little (3&#8221;W x 3&#8221;L x 3&#8221;T) treasure chest and is used to store and draw from for treasure tokens during the game.My 14-year-old son and I have played this a dozen or so times now, and it&#8217;s a simple and fun game.  Playing time for two players is about 15 minutes, and only slightly more for 3 or 4 players, so it&#8217;s definitely a quick-play game, suitable as a warm-up game for something longer, or to play while waiting for other players to arrive.  It also has a solo mode which plays exactly like the multiplayer, and strength is the biggest failing of Dungeon Roll.Playing the game is really just the player doing hand-control with his party dice vs the monster dice he is facing, pressing their luck as far as they can without being defeated and having to flee the dungeon.  There is no interaction between the players at all.  Yes, another player rolls the monster dice each round and keeps up with what dungeon level you are on, but there is no point where a player can take an action in their turn that affects another player at all.  You are multiple players taking turns playing a solo game, and it feels that way.  The only competition at all is when you add up Experience Points at the end of the game to see who had the most and therefore won.Still, Dungeon Roll is fast, well-themed, well made and despite the lack of interaction, it is still fun. For the price, it&#8217;s worth picking up if you play games like Zombie Dice or Cthulhu Dice, or just want a simple filler game with nice components.We&#8217;ll be playing this one for years to come."

Each Hero also has a Special Ability that can be used anytime and and Ultimate Ability that can only be used once per delve into the Dungeon. Hero can level up once after gaining enough experience points to help their special abilities.The game is played in the rounds or each playing delving into the dungeon three times each. The first player then rolls the 7 white dice to determine their party that may include Champions, Fighters, Wizards, Thieves and Clerics. The person to the Players left is the Dungeon Lord and rolls the Dungeon Dice as well as tracks the current players lever with the Level Die.The players turn consists of four different phases:The Monster Phase: The active player uses his companions (Champions, Fighters, Mages, Thieves and Clerics) to battle the Monster Dice (Skeleton, Goblins and Oozes.) Any Dragon dice rolled are set off to the side to be faced later if three or more Dragons are rolled. Once a companion is used to battle a monster is put in the graveyard and cannot be used again unless brought back with a potion later in the turn sequence. Dungeon Dice are returned to the Dungeon Pool to be reused again. The current player can press their luck and go deeper into the dungeon increasing the level on the Level Die and gaining more experience points. Level 1, one Dungeon Die is rolled, Level 2, two Dungeon Dice are rolled etc. If a player fails to defeat the current level, they must flee the Dungeon and their delve is over with out gaining any experience.The Loot Phase: The player can choose to do these in any order.Open Chests: One Thief or Champion may open any number of chests and all other companions can open a single chest.Quaff Potions: Any companion (including scroll die) can be used to quaff any number of potion dice. One potion equals on companion resurrected from the graveyard.Dragon Phase: If there have been 3 Dragon Dice rolled then the current adventurer must battle the Dragon! The adventurer can only defeat the Dragon if they have 3 different companions to battle it with. If there are not 3 Dragon Dice, skip this phase.Regroup Phase: Here the adventurer retires to the tavern. They collect experience points equal to the level they achieved on the Level Die. If the adventurer was brave enough and somehow made it all the way to Level 10 on this delve, they must retire and collect 10 experience points. The adventurer can keep seeking glory by going deeper into the Dungeon if they have not achieved Level 10 yet. Remember if the adventurer cannot defeat all the Monster Die, they must flee the Dungeon and no experience points are gained.Once the delve is over, the adventurer passes the dice to the left and play begins again with that player.Once all the adventurers have completed all three delves the game is over and the players count up their experience points. The one with the most wins!Treasure: When a chest is opened during the Monster Phase, the current player gets to retrieve treasure from the Dungeon. These can be used during a players turn if applicable like a fighter token or a mage token which acts as an additional companion die. Once the toke is used it is returned to the box. All unused treasure tokens count as experience points at the end for the player that has them.The components for Dungeon Roll are very good. The artwork is very nice, the dice are high quality with cool graphics and the tokens are small but serviceable and sturdy. The box is a cool treasure chest look for the packaging but I can see the lip on the inside getting damaged fairly easy so take care when closing the box. The Hero Cards are very attractive and of decent quality. As much room as in on the card, the text could have been bigger for people with eyesight issues but that is a super small quibble.Dungeon Roll is an very fun, quick romp through the dungeon and in some ways the theme really comes through. This is a great filler game or travel game as it all fits in the small treasure box and is playable anywhere anytime as it really only lasts about 15 minutes each game. Designer Chris Darden did a great job of finding a way to mix the luck of dice rolling with strategy and the feel of a dungeon crawl in such a small, compact quick game. This is a winning design and game. Great job Chris and Tasty Minstrel Games.I am giving this game 7 out 10 stars as it is very fun, quick and thematic at its core with just the right amount of luck and strategy for a filler game that keeps everyone engaged and is going to be great fun for kids and adults.This review was originally posted here: [...]"
0,1,I love a great game that is unique and different than the rest.Quick and easy to learn with advanced play that will challenge all hard core gamers.
1,0,"Formula D is a great party game that gets the entire room cheering. Even for the starter players, there is a set of basic rules that most can grasp very quickly. Every time I have played this game, I've had a great time. I do not enjoy cars or racing but the excitement of this game really gets your adrenaline going.The game lends easy to advanced players who want to implement the advanced rule set that want to make the game far more complicated and even more exciting.With the amount of people that can play, this game is a great pick for people that want to start introducing people into unconventional board games. I highly recommend this for anyone that is looking for a game to include a large group of people."
1,0,Dixit is the one game I own that nearly EVERY person will enjoy.  The artwork on the cards is beautiful and the game is always competitive and unique.  It has tons of replay value and there are expansions to add hours of more fun.  This game is a must own in any family that enjoys board games.
1,0,"This is a tricky game. My wife and 8-year-old daughter and I played it twice so far, but because we grew up in different countries & cultures, it's often impossible to come up with the shared but non-obvious references that are required to play the game. Whereas games like Trivial Pursuit are enhanced by having a variety of players, Dixit seems to rely on a bit of exclusionary tactics to make it playable: your piece moves further if at least one person chooses incorrectly.So I would not recommend this game for families and multi-generational groups, but I can imagine having a lot of fun playing with my metalhead friends and coming up with song titles, lyrics, and album covers that match the imagery on the cards."
0,1,"Dixit is a great game and why not get the Odyssey edition in case you end up inviting 12 people over for a game night one time? If I had to describe this unusually fun game, it's like 'Apples to Apples' with pictures =)."

0,1,"I have purchased S107, S032 and was given a Double Horse 9053-(Broken but now working). ALL COMMENTS ARE BASED ON ALL 3 HELICOPTERS BECAUSE I FLY THEM THE SAME WAY.  HARD AND FAST. All 3 controllers are touchy. A GOOD TOUCHY THOU. The BIGGER ones are the ones to watch.  They will shoot up fast on a full charge so all you have to do is hold them at (HEAD LEVEL) trim the helicopter.  Meaning a knob that will slow or stop the Heli from spinning.  Work the UP and DOWN Throttle first on ALL,  Then work the FORWARD and BACKWARD motion.  Do CIRCLES, FIGURE 8's and straight flying (BAM!) YOUR DONE.KEY POINT: TAKE YOUR TIME THIS IS NOT A REMOTE CONTROL CAR YOU CAN SLAM INTO A WALL AND GO OPPS! WITH PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY THE AGE REQUIREMENT IS HIGHER.S107: Hardest one to repair because of paper thin wires. One wire came disconnected from one of the motors.  Finally got a sodering gun TAP TAP, wire ON back in business.S032: Easy to disassemble & re-assemble disconnecting wires from circuit card easy. reconnecting motors, light sources everything. I have not had a problem other then on chipped blade.Double Horse 9053: Even easier. Bigger wires, bigger connectors on the circuit card  20 bucks for battery, $19.95 for a new transmitter and extra blades 10 bucks. It seems to meet all my standards as far as build quality on ALL THE MODELS I OWN. So I might buy a new one and have a second for spare parts.  I love taking care of stuff.  You know making the old new again.  It fancinates me.This is just pass time for me while I am deployed in Iraq.  So when I get home I will look at more high dollar ones for me as a new hobby and my grandson will fly the ones I have now.

This particular one was a lemon, but I would order another one because I have had good luck with Syma in the past."
0,1,A cheap but fun helicopter. It will not fly after several hours of use no matter what you do.I enjoyed three of them but bought a much larger and better one and it has many hours of flight time.Look for a better one and it is worth it. You can not use this outdoors at all.
1,0,"The toy, when working it a hoot.However, it was DOA out of the box. The problem was the battery compartment in the remote...  the battery lugs need to be pried out so they make contact with the batteries.  Did that, and it worked fine.Went about 5 flights, plenty of awesome wipeouts, then the rear motor cable came diconnected from the board...  the solder broke.  That's freakin' weak I say... if this thing breaks it should be due to a transmission failure or motor overload, not a breaking solder on the circuit board.  Anyway, splice it to another wire and it works again, so we'll give it another goSimple fabrications errors are all that need to be corrected with this thing, and you'd see next none 1 or 2 star ratings."
0,1,This is fairly easy to use but does take some practice. My teenager got it as a gift. He's played with it quite a few times. Always in the house. It's had a few accidents and bumped into the wall a few times but it's still good. His only complaint is the joystick is a little loose so it's hard to make it fly straight. It could just be inexperience also as it's his first remote control helicopter.
0,1,"Well our son of 10 has wanted a RC heli for quite some time . So I did allot of research a while back and had this added to our kids wish list. I noticed that the price had dropped below 20 bucks. I say what a deal, this little heli keeps him entertained indoors on rainy days. Not only is it durable but is easy to fly and Amazon carries extra parts if anything brakes.So far it has stood up to his flying abuse.As a Dad it is our duty to be the tester's and if it fails ,then it's not good enough for the kids.This heli is not for outdoors because of its Infrared radio band. I like the small size of the heli,great for small or big rooms.The heli comes with a USB cord for charging,which saves on the batteries in the controller.I have never timed it's flight or charge time.But I can guess about 30-50 min. charge for 8-10 min. flight. Not a whole lot of flight time , but this little booger can fly.Great little beginner heli for ages 8 and up! I would highly recommend the Syma S107G 3.5 ch R/C Helicopter for any R/C Heli beginner or that little big boy inside us Dads."
0,1,"This helicoptor was purchased for a four-year old.  After seeing his older brother with a different remote control helicoptor, he decided he wanted one as well.  The helicoptor is smaller than I had thought it would be.  Considering its size and the material it is made with, I have to closely monitor my child while he is using it.  If you are purchasing this for a young child, you may want to consider a different item."
0,1,"I chose this helicopter because of the reviews.  It sounded like a fairly sturdy and easy to operate toy.  It was a gift for my grandson, and they have had very little time to play with their Christmas toys as they've been on vacation.  The shipping was fast."
0,1,"I have purchased several of these helicopters as gifts.  They are easy for my 8 year old son and some of his friends to control.  Some other helicopters that we have played with in the past are too hard for him to steer without crashing.  Amazon also sells replacement parts for low prices, which is great if you crash it and damage the trim pieces.  You can also buy an AC charger for the battery which I recommend."
1,0,"These are fun to play with.  Some things that need noted: 1) Don't plan on using these much, if at all, outside.  The smallest breeze messes them up.  2) I ordered two of these and getting the channels setup is a little difficult- not impossible just difficult.  3) If you need directions, the ones that comes with these are not the best.  My advice, throw away the directions and figured it out on your own.Don't get me wrong for the price these are a lot of fun.  My 9 year old daughter has no problem flying them."
0,1,"I have purchase six of these Hero RC Viking quads...  I have not been more pleased with them.. They are very tough I have crashed them into buildings, trees, and the ground so far all are still flying.. You can have air combat with friends with two or more flying at the same time.. I have crashed so hard that the battery flies away from the accident scene.. I bought my grandson one he is just nine months old he sat on it, but it still flies.. The thing I have found with this quad is that once you insert the battery the quad needs to be on a level surface... I have it upside down and insert the battery once the red LED starts to flash fast turn on the transmitter and allow it to bind you will hear a beep and then it's time for some fun... The transmitter has a high/low setting use the high setting low is disappointing and with this transmitter the button on the right is the flip control have the quad hover press and hold the button then used the joystick for direction and the quad will flip.. It loses altitude while flipping so have some ground clearance once you start flipping the quad.. I ordered four more co workers have bought them, and it's on during breaks...  Warning these quads will fly in the wind and I find it is much more fun trying to control them. However the quad will fly very high so much so that you will find it difficult to track them...They are green and black so finding them after a high somewhat windy flight may be difficult in trees and high grass. Once the battery has been discharge the LED will start to flash it's time to land... The unit comes with two batteries so you have some great flight time... So order one have some fun!! Order two and have a air combat battles... Remember to protect your eyes from the rotors if you fly to close..."
0,1,"This this is huge. It is fun for a 3 channel coaxial. It is no different than a cheaper tiny one except being enormous. If you don't want to get into pitch control but want something larger and fun, get this. It can be flown inside, but you better have enough space to bail out safely if you lose control of it. It would seriously cause damage considering it essentially has 2 lawnmower blades. It could probably break fingers or seriously bruise you so be careful."
0,1,"I loved this game as a kid and recently got back into it when I started playing online.  So for Christmas last year it was one thing I asked for.  I love it!  Although it can be a quick game sometimes it can take forever!  J but once you get going you can usually figure out which direction to go.  I like to play this game with the family-even though it is for only two people we usually can find ways for everyone to play or my mom and I or sister and I will play.  But, we all thoroughly enjoy it!  I would recommend this for anyone who likes board games young or old.  As this is one you will have a blast with."
0,1,"We love playing pit together with our international friends. It is a fun game to play when folks do not have a lot of language in common. I also gave this as a gift to an international student and it has been used and enjoyed! Be aware, thought, that this is a loud game! So it is not a good choice when you want to have quiet interaction. But if you don't mind shouting, some rowdiness and hysterical laughter, this is your game. All in all a great group game!"
0,1,"Fun quick game 20 minutes playtime.Fun, though exhausting!Very easy to learn. Intuitive, Fast,  fast, fast!There's a lot of yelling. Fun."
0,1,I love games that are more of an all play.  Have played the original and this just is a bit more up scale.
0,1,"My now adult sons owned this game during their childhood which I still have in tact and in great condition.  My granddaughters ages 9 and 7 learned how to play the game at camp last summer, so I ordered this one for them to have at home.  It is still a great game but not the quality of the one that was purchased over 30 years ago."
0,1,"My 5 year old son loves this game. It says you have to be 8 years or up to play, but we explained the rules to him and he understood. It is challenging and fun!"
0,1,"A little more ergonomically made since I was a kid, but still the same ol' game! Love it! Wish my 8 year old son loved it just as much, but it's not electronic, of course."
0,1,"I like the new look and feel of this Mastermind game. Beyond that, there really isn't anything I can say about it. It's Mastermind."
0,1,"Surely everyone knows Twister? My first encounter was when my sister got the game for her birthday in 1976.She and her friends had a ball with it at her party, then the adults had a go; or rather the Dads.The Mums all seemed to wear frocks in those days and they didn't want to disgrace themselves at my Sister's party! The Dads on the other hand, would be really dumb at the drop of a hat to make us kids laugh.I remember it being fun whatever age I was (I played a lot of games at college and we were all pretty giddy with wine then, much like the Dads back in 76!).You can't fail to enjoy it, just be careful if your back is troubled or you have any injuries that are healing. Oh and be careful if you play with someone with stinky feet! the game really is a ""shoes off"" number, This is a fine idea but I remember back in 76 one of the Dads was not so sweet and one of my college buddies was rank! This means the mat needs a wipe down occassionally, otherwise there is a unfortunate lasting pong every time you open the box!!"
0,1,Small little set not what I expected.  Found a much nicer larger set at one of the big dollar chains.  A waste and not a good gift. Looks cheap
0,1,"I'm not sure how these blocks got any positive reviews. Most important to me...all the blocks with the pic of an elephant are misspelled and read ""elerhant"". The pictures over all are not great. The grapes look like cherries...have you ever seen candy apple red grapes? The apples look like red pumpkins. Some of the blocks have pictures but the corresponding letter has been replaced by a symbol and other letters...confusing to a child trying to learn. Additionally, the quality of these blocks is not great as the paint was already scratched off on a few when they arrived and the wood is frayed on some. They have a strong odor (kind of like clay). Lastly, they are quite small as others warned although the size is clearly written in the description. I expect to see a set like this at a dollar store and would not recommend."
0,1,"My mother bought this toy for my 3 year old son last year for Christmas. The product description said it was for 36 mos to 7 years old.  When we opened it up and started to play, we quickly discovered that this toy was NOT for a three year old.  It was fairly simple to make horizontal gears move and rotate, but when you started to build vertically, things got extremely complex and did not work without serious forethought, planning, and experimentation.  In this aspect, I loved the toy as its educational value skyrocketed.  The creativity aspect of the toy is boundless too, as you can build and imagine anything you like with it.  However, my 3 year old did not have the skill set to do this type of complex engineering.  We broke the toy out again about a month ago and my now 4 year old was able to build a really cool gear plate with multiple horizontal connections, but he still did not have the ability to build or imagine vertically.  We sat down together to try to build vertically, and he did not enjoy the challenges this presented - frustration was quick.  I had to give this toy a 3 star rating because of the complexity.  My son has a fantastic attention span and can sit for long lengths of time on a project, but this toy was so difficult that he lost interest after about 25 mins.  Children with shorter attention spans I don't think would put in the time.That being said, I think this toy could be VERY cool for older kids - maybe 3rd grade and up?  Maybe even Middle School and High Schoolers could get a kick out of creating something with it!  It is colorful, teaches multiple skills at a time (planning, designing, experimentation, cause/effect, etc.) but I would never recommend for young kids.  The coolest part of the toy for my 3 year old was the light up flashers that came with it.  We kept those out and he'd turn the lights off in his room and place the flashers all around in the dark, turn on his Disney CD player and make a pseudo dance club.  LOL!"
1,0,"This it the type of toy that looks great for 2-4 year olds to work on spatial perception, cause/effect, etc.You can set the gears in several configurations to figure out which parts will move or not. With this specific set you can't build a lot of different contraptions, but you can set gears in different spatial configurations.Conceptually, this seems great for young kids, but something that is somewhat limited for older kids. The pieces are durable and of high quality. The problem is that the pieces fit too tight, so it is really hard (nearly impossible) for little hands to do the assembling and manipulation. If the adult needs to put together the toy, and then help the child move the pieces then, in my opinion,  the value of the toy goes away. Now, if they could only modify the pieces slightly so little kids could actually play with them (instead of just looking) this would be a wonderful toy."
0,1,"These sound like a really great building set with lots of educational potential. Unfortunately, the pieces are not designed very well. Many of the pieces are difficult for little ones to put together, much less to pull back apart. Also, the way the pieces work together is pretty limiting to how you can build and get the gears working together. Various pieces interconnect, but they don't all universally interconnect, and if you connect some with blank spacer connects and others with the gear axle pieces, they come out different heights and the gears don't line up. Ideally a set like this would be designed with universally connecting pieces that would allow for things to easily line up and work together. There's definitely fun to be had with this toy, but it could be much much better had more thought gone into its design."
0,1,These are a nice little toy. stimulating for the young mind. I have incorporated this into my engineering lesson plan.
1,0,"This was such a great buy! I originally ordered one as a gift for my nephew but when I saw it in person, I had to order another one for my son. It is very sturdy plastic and you can build a lot from just this set."
1,0,"This gift was very well received by my niece and her two small boys. She said it was a wonderful teaching experience for them; to count, add, subtract, and handle play money. They play with it all the time and it never gets old."
1,0,Our little man loves this cash register. He puts real money in it as well. We are playing/working on early math skills & it makes it a lot of fun.
0,1,"My 4-yr-od daughter got this for Christmas and I noticed the older kids kept wanting a turn! It &#34;cha-ching's!&#34; when you open the drawer, the money is very life-like, and the little card is sturdy. I love that it shuts off on it's own and isn't one more toy requiring batteries. It's a sturdy little machine that I am sure we will have for many years to come!"
1,0,This is a newer register than the 10+ year old one I had I was allowing my granddaughters to use and she will be so very happy when I allow her to open this new one.  She loves the sound of the card scanning and the opening of the register and the handling of the money and it is going to be a tremendous resource in teaching her about money and counting!
1,0,"I purchased this for my son on his third birthday. I was really surprised at how sturdy and well made it was. It is solar powered so the calculator will always work. You will need batteries however for the cash register to make the ""ching"" noise as it opens and closes and for the beeping noise with the credit card. The batteries were already included which was nice. It came with plenty of play money and coins and a credit card. It is a great eduactional toy which kids as young as my son all the way to much older kids will enjoy playing with. I highly recommend this cash register. It is a great buy!"
1,0,"I purchased this for my son for Christmas. He loves playing with the money, the coins especially. The set up is pretty simple, it has a calculator, on/off buttons and an open button. The money looks fairly realistic-the coins more so than the bills, and the trays can accommodate real currency as well.  This is a great cash register for a child to pretend with."
0,1,We love the book in our house so I assumed this would be a GREAT game for the kids.  We have played it twice and the second time I could tell the kids were not interested in playing.  Pretty boring and disappointing for the $18 or so I paid for it.
1,0,My son has had a great time figuring out this game and doing different configurations. Perfect for him and his sister at ages 6 and 4.
0,1,We love this game.  its great and portable for taking to doctors offices and other long appointments and a lot of fun to play.  My 10 year old and I take turns doing puzzles and have a lot of fun together.
0,1,"My kids love this game. I loved this game as a kid. But as an adult, oh my G! This game is tedious and can be REALLY LONG. Basically, it sucks. It totally sucks.But it's a classic. You loved it. Your kids will love it. So you have to get it. If you live in the United States and have a child, you simply have no choice."
1,0,"Loved Candyland as a kid, and was so glad to be able to buy it for my own daughter.  Unfortunately, I really do not like the graphics they use now compared to the original.  Otherwise, the game is still classic fun and enjoyable for the kids."
1,0,"I gave this 5 stars because this IS a truly classic game for many past generations and for many future generations to come!  As a grandparents we both remember playing it as children.  I purchased this for our granddaughter who is too young for it at the present time however, we KNOW she'll love it as much as we did and our children did growing up.  Absolutely recommend it for ALL children!"
1,0,"I remember this game from being a kid, and I purchased this one for Children's Hospital LA.  Still as cute as ever!"
0,1,"There is a reason nearly every child owns or has at least played Candy Land at least once. Its a classic. It's easy to learn & small children can join in the fun because they don't need to know how to count or read. If they can identify colors, they can play. We had a Candy Lane game for our first grandchild. She lives 2 hours away. She enjoyed the game so much, we let her take it home. This game is going to remain at Nana's house so all of the grandchildren, as well as Nana :) can enjoy the game."
0,1,We play this a lot even though our children are slowly aging out of it. Great for them to play with younger siblings and cousins.
1,0,"I loved this game as a child.  Turns out my 5 yr old loves it too!  The only complaint: it doesn't seem as sturdy as the one I had as a child.  Other than that, we love it."
0,1,We purchased this as a gift for our son. He LOVEs playing it! We were unable to find it in store. I am glad we found it on amazon.
0,1,"Just like we used to play, new vamped up colors, new pegs to move, but the same classic game. We have lost the little rubber feet pegs that are inserted into the bottom of the game board. But even without them, the game works great."
0,1,"This is not the Trouble you might remember from childhood.  ""Chinky"" is the word that comes to mind - the bottom is a piece of flimsy cardboard, similar to what is used in cereal boxes.  Very disappointing!  I'd rather spend a bit more and get a quality product than get this garbage.  What a shame."
0,1,not only a great game helps kids count also. everyone should love this game most of us grew up with it
1,0,"Trouble is a classic game - Milton Bradley brings us the classic board game that is fun for the whole family to play.Four players can play this, my only concern is the popper, I wonder how long it will last, the metal popper is a little flimsy and may break over extended use - we'll see. You can always use some dice as a backup.  Game is fun for the family to play.I purchased this along with Connect Four, good games next to Checkers and Chess."
1,0,"After recently purchasing Sleeping Queens and LOVING it, adults and kids included, I started looking into other card-based games, which are perfect for travel. I bought this one based on reviews and because I thought perhaps my 4-year old daugther could easily join in as well, and hid it to be a surprise for a recent vacation.We played it once. It NEVER ends. Like literally, once you get down to two people, I cannot see any way this game ever ends. And that sucks. Really, my daughter and I were the last two left, and ended up playing for 20 minutes after everyone else had left, eventually deciding to end and eat ice cream. Such a boring game in general, and it goes on and on and on.Get Sleeping Queens."
0,1,"I bought this game for my 7 year old son who is crazy for card games, but this was too much.  It's a little complicated at first but my 10 year old started to catch on to the rules and enjoyed it.  I wouldn't recommend it for a child under the age of 9-10."
0,1,"We've had this game for quite a long time. It has held up over the years and makes for some fun game play.It is best played with a younger child (we've done it ages 4 to maybe 8). Each sandwich shaped card has a food item picture. Players take turns turning over their Slamwich cards one at a time. If two cards are the same in a row, the first player to slap the pile gets all the cards in the current pile and adds them to the bottom of their pile. Or if there is one card separating the match, you can do the same thing. There are also thieves that require a loud, ""Stop thief"" and a slap. There are muncher cards too but we've never been able to work that into our game, they seem to make it more awkward to play.So the game continues until only one player has all the cards.It is fun seeing some of the combinations of pictures (peppers with jelly side-by-side) and it is fun for the kids to slap the table.It takes moments to learn and can be played for just 5 minutes or longer if you want to drag it out or play again. k"
1,0,"We were looking for a quick game that we could play on game nights between longer sessions.  This fits in just perfectly.  The game has very simple rules (the lowest score wins), and it is player ended (first person that believes they have the lowest score, says ""Rat a tat cat"" and brings the game to it's final round).  It goes by quick.  A game can last anywhere from 60 seconds to a couple of minutes, especially once you get the rules down, cards are flying.  Everyone seems to enjoy it too, all age groups, and the strategy and counting aspect is simple enough that my 5 year old can play without assistance, and often beats the adults!The game itself is just cards, in a much larger, sturdy cardboard box.  If you have other Gamewright card games, it's the same kind of box you get with Sleeping Queens, Zeus on the Loose, etc.  The game itself doesn't take much space (four cards for each person on the table at a time, plus a draw deck and a discard pile - that's it) so this makes a good game to take with you on vacations, traveling or while visiting friends.  The rules are simple enough to explain and lure others into a game as well.The only two complaints are very small...  First is the ""6"" card.  It has a giant green cat balloon being lead by small rats.  It is indeed a ""Rat"" card and not a desirable ""cat"" card despite the cat being depicted as the focus.  Also the ""4"" is very slim and stylized and looks like a ""1"".  Have had confusion over a younger player and an elderly player believing they had a ""1"" when it was really a ""4"".  Do these little things ruin the game?  Absolutely not, but it is something you might want to point out to those new to the game.Also don't expect lengthy game sessions.  Rat-a-Tat-Cat is fun for the fast paced, quick card game that it is.  It's not nearly as popular with my kids as ""Horse Show"" or ""Sleeping Queens"" but they always demand to play it in between games, and that says a lot."
0,1,Great Game for a family with younger children. It's never to early to teach your kids a poker face. Have fun.
1,0,"This was a birthday present for my 4-year old little girl. Since her birthday (3 months ago), she has asked to play this game EVERY day, multiple times a day. She loves it! I have to admit that I really enjoy it too. It says it is for ages 6 and up, but she grasped the concept of the game very quickly and is able to play independently. It has been a fun way to also work on addition. I love it, my little girl loves it and my husband loves it! What more could we ask for. The packaging is very nice. It is easy for my little girl to put the cards away when we are all done playing. The cards seem to be very durable as well. We play it a lot and we haven't seen any wear or tear. Can't recommend this game enough. Now if I could find another game that we could enjoy just as much!"
1,0,"I gave this Mathshark to my son for Christmas and he LOVES it.  He is 7 and my daughter is 11 and they are both enjoying it and using it.  I figure if they want to be on a type of video screen sometimes, they might as well be learning!  I highly recommend it."
0,1,"Bought for my seven year old grandson.  He had loved the electronic dictionary but found this toy below his level.  It did not hold his interest.  It only allows you to drill, like electronic flashcards - there is no ""game"" aspect to it so he gets bored fast. I could see keeping this in the car or using it as part of daily homework, but he's unlikely to pick it up and play just for fun.It fits better in an adults hands than a childs, as it's quite bigger. The buttons feel almost old-fashioned, you really have to push them with force to make it register - I think if this was used often, the buttons would wear out. It's easy to figure out how to use it, but once you start one of the flashcard quizzes, there isn't a good way to exit. You have to finish the whole quiz or turn it off to start over on a different skill, which is a bit annoying if you start a quiz and realize it's too easy or difficult and want to change the level.That's about it - a good tool but not a lot of ""fun""."
1,0,"Gave this to a 12 year old boy who loves this kind of thing and he told me it was great fun!  Not so good for my brain, but he loved it! (-:"
0,1,I've stocked up on these ThinkFun games.  They're great for cottages and family trips.  The best part is you don't need batteries!
0,1,This is a nice gift overall but comes apart too often for me.  Especially when other children are visiting my house.
0,1,I bought this toy for my daughters second birthday. Shes three now and it remains one of her favorites. Its so sturdy i have to tell my 9 year old to leave it alone LOL.The only problem that i have withg it is that it only fits one comfortably. But other than that ITS GREAT!!! I highly reccomend it. You will defenetly get your moneys worth!-L
0,1,"My 5 year old and almost 2 year old love this, it's one of the few toys they have where they play together without fighting. They fill their backpacks and lunchboxes, put on jackets and hats and out they go. I've even been given a small part in the production; when the five year old comes back in and says ""Hi mom"", he has instructed me to say ""How was soccer practice?"" It's great, folds pretty much flat and slides under the couch. Unfolds in seconds and can be used indoors or out. There's even a cool inflatable steering wheel. The photographs of them peeking out the windows are fab!"
1,0,"This is an awesome buy! Sturdy, hours of fun. Very easy to store and it pops open in seconds. I love how it isnt held together with pvc so it doesnt bend or break easily. Love it!"
0,1,"They said this is for ages 3+, but I bought this for my grandaughter who is 16 months and she had it mastered within 5 minutes.  Great teaching tool, since so many toys don't teach but kids get to watch.  This teaches pumping the arm up and down, how to stick it to the floor and watch it and then start it up again - one of her favorites."
0,1,These bathtub fingerpaints colors are not nearly as vibrant as the two different bathtub crayons I also purchased and not nearly as much fun for my 20 month old.  He loves to write on himself and the tub with the crayons but the paints are much too thin to really even see.
0,1,"The amount of ""paint"" was pretty minimal given the amount needed to really make designs or pictures.  The palette ""hand"" was a waste entirely.  It isn't meant to float, its too big for the side of the tub or the corners of it and not many toddlers are going to want to finger paint and have the coordination to do so without tipping it over.My son found this to be fun, I found it to be a waste of money in terms of length of play.  Bathtub crayons last longer, are less costly and have more options."
0,1,"Like Rush Hour, Railroad Rush Hour has you ""escaping"" the traffic jam... this time in the railroad yard, where the traffic can include rail cars and cargo.  Rearrange the pieces to get the engine out.40 challanges included; nylon bag stores pieces when not in use.  Larger than Rush Hour pieces makes this puzzle easier to handle for eager young solvers.  And with the new pieces, the challanges are all new and different, even for Rush Hour lovers!"
0,1,"I am spatially impaired and tend very often to play with tangrams. I hesitated to buy this at first since I already used the standard tangrams. However, after I purchased this set which consisted of 2 colors there were puzzles in which I enjoyed slight challenges. This set uses a set of tangrams which are differently shaped called isosceles tangrams. If you already play with tangrams this puzzle set may be redundant, particularly if you are very good. But for others, I recommend this to be a reasonably good challenge."
0,1,"Everyone likes to try this, but after a few puzzles they get discouraged.  The help or &#34;cheat&#34; cards really are great and do exactly what they aim to do - help you solve the puzzles but the kids lose interest when they have to use the cards each time."
1,0,Purchased for the grandsons that are being home schooled by their mother and keeps the kids on their toes and thinking.
0,1,Excellent game for problem solving skills and spacial relations. Shape by shape is challenging and provides hours of entertainment. Another exceptional product by ThinkFun.
1,0,Very satisfied with my purchase and the quality of the toy.  Bought for my grandchildren to enjoy the jack-in-the-box as I did when a child.
0,1,This jack in the box is just like old time.  It works really well.  An older child or adult has to turn the handle to make the music and to make the jack pop out of the box.
1,0,"This classic never goes out of style, or fun! Cute, funny and nostalgic! My kids loved it! Would recommend this product!"
0,1,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS!! What a great drum. First off its sooo cute, the colors are great, materials used are of really good quality and the adjustable strap is comfy around your child's neck. Awesome price, wonderfully made drum and a happy mom! Great purchase!"
0,1,"We LOVE Insect Lore's Butterfly Garden and Butterfly Pavilions (the bigger sets). They were SO easy. The caterpillars come in, and you don't have to do anything! It's all in a self-contained food container. Once they turn into chrysalids you move them into the habitat (a little difficult) and voila- butterflies emerge! My 4 year is amazed at the transformation. It has made a fantastic science lesson as he now knows the entire life cycle."
0,1,"We have used the butterfly garden twice already. I ordered the larva online (5 bucks I think) and shipping was pretty fast, within 4 or 5 days. Since my daughter was in the 5-6 range when using, it involves some adult help (transferring the cocoons, feeding, placing in a safe area away from curious cats, etc). I like that there is an option to reorder more caterpillars from their website. The two times that I ordered, I received 5 larva each time and all hatched (even when one of the cocoons fell off the paper when transporting)."
1,0,"The Live Butterfly Garden by Insect Lore is a fun, hands- on educational experience that is certain to appeal to even the most stubborn, disinterested child. With the Live Butterfly Garden, children get to observe the process of metamorphosis, right before their eyes. Starting with caterpillars, children watch the little critters eat food, create a cocoon, and then transform into fully grown adult butterflies. The butterflies can then be observed in their habitat for a while before setting free.This butterfly garden is great for dozens of reasons, the most obvious of which is the educational value. Reading about insects and metamorphosis is one thing, but seeing the process live is another thing entirely. Kids get to learn how caterpillars/butterflies live, eat, and thrive; how to care for them; etc. They get to observe the caterpillars and butterflies at play and watch the butterflies eat their food, which is provided in the package. The caterpillars that come with the Live Butterfly Garden are painted ladies, which are not very common and will not be recognized by most children. However, most kids won't care- the fun of watching these small caterpillars transform into butterflies will have many kids gazing in awe, and prompt them to ask many questions.This educational toy is a huge hit and my kids loved it, but there were a few small issues. One was waiting for the caterpillars to arrive in the mail. To get the caterpillars, you have to mail in an included certificate, along with a check, and then wait. It seems like an eternity, especially from the perspective of young children, and it took longer than expected. Anther problem was parting with the butterflies. Once you have the caterpillars and they have transformed into adult butterflies, the next problem will be setting them free. Kids will grow attached to their small, winged friends and will not want to let them go. Another minor issue is with the transferring of the caterpillars from their small container- the one you receive in the mail- into the actual habitat. The container that the caterpillars arrive in has a paper area at the top, where the caterpillars will hang as they spin their cocoons. This paper section is fairly easy to remove, but the problem is that the cocoons are very delicately attached, and that means that some will fall off when the transfer is made. You will need to pin this piece of paper to the inside of the butterfly garden, but the kit doesn't include any pins. Safety pins or straight pins work, and it would have been nice if these were included in the kit.Still, when all factors are considered, the Live Butterfly Garden is worth the purchase and young children will enjoy the educational experience. Sure, it could be improved a little bit by making a few minor changes, but this is still a very good toy and considering my kid's fascination with the process, along with the educational value, it earns an easy recommendation."
0,1,I got this for my 5 year old daughter.. first I thought wow what a great deal then you have to go the website and pay another 5$ for shipping of the caterpillars. Which takes over a week. When we finally got them they went into their cocoon in 2 days. Then once they come out of their cocoon they bleed all over the place. My daughter was too young for this but we will try again when she a bit older.
0,1,"So, okay, I could deal with the balls of caterpillar excrement all over the cup, and the fact that I was supposed to pull it off the chrysalides when I transfered them to their netting.But what really turned my stomach-- and my daughter's-- was the meconium all over the place after they hatched.My caterpillars developed at different rates. We had four. (One must have died in transit.) One of the chrysalides hatched days before the others. Then came the next two, then one lagged behind by 5 or 6 days. The problem was that the first one expelled meconium ALL OVER the white paper, looking like a big bloody mess. I know it's not blood-- it's &#34;waste matter,&#34; which isn't a whole lot better... but whatever it is, it looked just like blood, and we couldn't get rid of the paper because the other three chrysalides were still attached to it. When they emerged, they sprayed their meconium all over the ground, the netting, everywhere. Honestly, I have no idea if this is normal or not-- I don't see a lot of other reviewers even mentioning it, so I'm guessing we had some seriously meconium-filled butterflies!Anyway, my daughter basically wanted nothing to do with them once the giant blood stain appeared, so I was pretty eager for the last guy to hatch so we could set them free and throw away the netting. In fact, I haven't been able to bring myself to touch it again... it's sitting out in the yard just where we set them free!I know that it's a fact of life, the beauty of nature, blah blah. But we'll be just as happy watching the butterflies in our yard and never again having to see exactly how they came to be that way! Kudos to the rest of you, who apparently have stronger stomachs than we do. ;)"
0,1,My boys loved this and so did I this was well worth the money.. Very educational  so much fun watching these grow l
0,1,Have given one to a 5 and 6 year old boy and they get a lot of fun and education out of it watching the butterfly grow.  You can get the larvae mail order or just do what we do and go outside and find a caterpiller.  Kids like the outside adventure much better than the mail order approach.
0,1,"My grandkids love this (ages 5 & 7), but even the little one (18 months) watches the ""babys"" to see what they are doing.  Easy to use, doesn't take up a lot of space (you can hang it) and the kids love watching and waiting for the butterflys to emerge.  Educational, fun, teaches patience, many object lessons.  Overall a wonderful product."
0,1,"This is a great product. My boys loved watching the process. Everything goes perfectly if you follow the directions. I was worried the catapillars were dead on arrival, but they perked up later in the day. My only warning is that when the butterflies hatch out a reddish goo comes out with them & that reddish goo will go through the bottom or sides of the habitat onto your table. We originally had it on my dinning room table, but moved it when they were ready to hatch (thank goodness) The directions do warn you not to worry about the goo, but don't warn you it will soak through. Don't set the habitat on anything nice in your home. That is the only minor negative. It's a great project for small children & there are so many kids books out on butterfiles to make it even more fun."
0,1,"This butterfly garden saw so much use over the years for all manner of critters, not just butterflies. It finally dry-rotted from so much time outside but we sure did get our money's worth out of it!"
0,1,"This was so much fun!  I gave this kit to my son and he was absolutely magnetized by this.  Once you get the kit, you have to send in the form with a small s/h and, in about a week & 1/2 you get little critters (look like dark maggots) creeping and crawling around a cake of solid sand (I am aware that this does not sound good:).  Then, they make their way to the top of the lid and instinctively hang upside-down by their own silk and turn into this weird shell-like creatures.  Then, they pop out and become beautiful butterflies that you can release.I think I had as much fun with this than my children did.Of course, the habitat can be reused and all you need are the larvae (inexpensive).Have fun (hope I didn't gross you all out...but, hey...that's nature:)Miles"
0,1,Two of my children received two butterfly kits for their birthday and we are currently waiting for our butterflies to emerge.  This kit is very easy to use and crazy fun.The kit comes with the mesh habitat and a certificate to receive caterpillars in the mail.  What arrives a few days after you order them is a plastic container with larvae (caterpillars)inside for which you put honey water in the bottom and close with the paper lid sealed under the plastic lid.  The caterpillars eat the  honey mixture for several days then attach to the top of the paper lid while making their chrysalises (about 2-3 weeks wait for this).  A few days after that you pop the plastic lid off the container and pin the paper to the side of the mesh habitat wall. When the butterflies are emerging you drop flowers and/or sugar water soaked tissue balls into the bottom of the habitat and watch your butterflies eat.  We are at that stage now (waiting for the butterflies) so I don't know yet if we keep the butterflies for a day or more.  The instructions say to wait to release based on outside temps (over 55 degrees for several days in a row).  Our instructions also say the new butterflies might lay eggs so I'm waiting to see if we get a full life cycle and can start over (for free!).  Either way we are very happy with this item and I highly recommend getting it.
0,1,"My daughter loves butterflies... all bugs really.. so this should be a fun experiment.. she wanted one when they were at Costco.. but they dont carry summer things during the winter.. so I was very happy to find Amazon had it.. thank you so much, I dont think we can order the butterflies until spring, but she is very happy to have this.. fast shipping, great packaging! Thanks.! v"
1,0,"My five-year-old was learning about the butterfly's life cycle at school and I thought getting this live butterfly garden would be a great idea, and it was! We bought one through Amazon and another off a different site with the same wonderful results. Like many other reviewers have mentioned, it's preferable that one waits until spring to order this as firstly, the larvae will not travel well in the cold weather, and secondly, releasing butterflies into the frigid cold would be a cruel thing to do. Also, the kit does NOT come with the larvae - you need to mail in the voucher that comes with the kit together with a minimal processing fee of three dollars and the company will send the larvae and food. We received five larvae in their own little container and food. All five turned into butterflies - and watching the entire process/life cycle is a wondrous experience indeed! My daughter was amazed at how the caterpillars turned into chrysalis and finally transformed into butterflies - the expression on her face alone was worth the entire experiment. The butterflies are the painted lady variety and are beautiful to behold - we released them after a few days. This is a wonderful learning and observational tool which will encourage children's interest in science and to appreciate the beauty of nature. Highly recommended!"
0,1,Exactly what we needed for extra activities for busy preschoolers.  I would definately buy them again.  They were all working and have not had any problems with them.
0,1,"Great for young kids!  Who didn't love playing with bean bags as a kid?  A great product to have around the house and let the kids or you come up with games, who can balance a bean bag on their head the longest?  Make up a toss game so kids can practice their aim.  Or try something as simple as playing catch with them!  The possibilities are endless!"
0,1,This is a wonderfully creative toy.  It is colorful and well made.  The board is magnetic and the gears are lots of fun.  The seller was prompt and the package arrived in great shape.
1,0,"My toddler (28 months old) loves gears.  We bought this set to supplement our refrigerator set (TOMY Gearation Refrigerator Magnets Building Toy) with more gears.  This set exceeded our expectations.  Like the other set, the plastic gears and decals are colorful and fun.  This set includes eleven gears, including two sound-making gears (a ""clicker"" and a ""ringer"", with a tiny bell).We liked that the gears' teeth are smaller than some of the other play gear sets, giving this one less of a ""little kid toy"" look. Our toddler, like most, is drawn to things that aren't toys first and foremost. The magnets are strong enough to keep the gears where they need to be, but even a small child can still easily nudge one across the metal surface to mesh the gears.All is not perfect, though.  The gear with the rotating arm sometimes touches other gears instead of gliding over them, making the gears stick and stop rotating.  The gear that has a sold-colored cutout top with the teeth that spins over a fixed base with a colorful sticker has a similar problem. It's a mid-sized gear and the principle is good, but the execution is lacking. The cover wobbles sometimes, making the gears stop spinning and the motor click painfully. (Poor motor.) Then the kid (or you) has to figure out which gear is causing the problem, interrupting play. Or enhancing problem-solving, if you want to think about it that way.The powered backer board is a good idea, but with the batteries, it's very large and heavy for even a tall two-year-old.  It's in the closet until he's bigger, but by then I doubt he'll be playing with this toy anymore, unless Tomy comes out with new gear expansion sets.  If you're buying this for an older child, I think you'll get more use out of the board than we have.Bottom line:  If your kid likes the Gearation refrigerator set, you MUST HAVE this set, too, so you'll have a respectable number of gears for play.  Be aware that each of the four non-powered gears in the refrigerator set is duplicated in this set, though they have different decals."
0,1,"Really liked all the gears that came with this toy, a nice variety with sounds (bells, clickers), eyes that move and flip, and the various decals that make them interesting.  The only thing I don't like is that the magnets could be a little stronger.  They don't really fall off, but a small accidental nudge as you are arranging them and they tend to shift so you have to go back and nudge them around until they are all touching again.  It says you can move them manually, but becuase they shift so easily, it is hard to do this w/o the gears moving apart.Overall a good toy."
0,1,Bought this for my 2 1/2 yrs old son... He loves it.  He learned the concept of speed... Slow vs fast.  As well as fitting the gears together.  Even my 4 months old son loves watching the gears turning.
0,1,"My two and a half year old has been playing with this toy over three days now and he just loves it.  As he has figured out how to play with it on his own he has gained a sense of accomplishment and it is good for fine motor skills as well as learning consequences (if the gears don't mesh, they don't turn, etc.).  It is brightly colored, the sound can be annoying but no more annoying than most other toys.  I highly recommend this toy."
0,1,"I bought this after seeing it at one of our early development classes for our Autistic 2 year old.  He loved it at class and now loves it at home!!  Our 4 year old (who is not autistic) loves it as well and it has definitely been worth the money.My only wish is that there was an accessory pack of extra gears that work with the board.  It comes with 11 gears total, but it'd be fun to have a different variety pack of gears that do different things.Overall, very happy with this purchase!  Great for a rainy day or any day at all really!"
1,0,Bought this for 7 year old daughter who is totally into sharks. She had a great time making the casts and later painting them. I was impressed at how good they turned out. We attached the magnets to them and have them on our fridge. One fell and broke but we were able to glue it back together.
0,1,I actually found these at home goods for [...]...well I am glad I did not pay more than [...]... First off the colors of the dolphins were all messed up..they didn't match their tubes...When I mean they didn't match...they put in whacky colors like red/orange colored dolphin but a yellow tube (no yellow dolphin) then we got two of the same colored dolphins.  Okay..so the colors weren't a huge deal I suppose but then the dolphins wouldn't whistle...that's totally useless...and as someone else mentioned the links don't stay linked. HUGE disappointment!
1,0,"I swear by the reviews on Amazon.com, but unfortunately I did not read them before purchasing.  Our 4th son just turned 1, and celebrated his 2nd Christmas.  I just bathed him and put the dolphins in with him....believe what you read.  The rings do not stay together and the dolphins really don't sing!!  If you tap the tops of the head, nothing happens; if you lift the dolphin out of the water and slightly &quot;smack&quot; the water with it, it will make a noise.  Quite frankly it works better if you blow into the dolphin.  The baby got a kick out of the toy for a short time.  Maybe I'll keep it just because he can dunk the dolphins and toss them around.  Also, this toy takes up lots of room!!  I gave it 4 stars for durability since it does seem pretty sturdy."
0,1,Received this for my 1-yr-old and he still plays with it sometimes - he is now 3. It is really hard to get it to play music how it is intended to be played with. It is also way too big - I hate drying out all of the peices all the time when my son is done with it in the bath. He likes to play with the dolphins individually and just pretends with them instead of using it as it as advertised. It has poor musical ability...Buy something more fun with your money!
0,1,"I bought this for my daughter, new in the package at our local Goodwill, for $7.99, no tax. Its just a simple, colorful water toy. I filled a pasta pot 1/3 way with H20 and she has so much fun with it. She doesn't ""get"" the musical part, which is that the dolphins are hollow and have a whistle inside...when their head is tapped (they have to be floating in the life preserver ring) they make a short, pleasant little whistle. Eventually she'll figure that part out...she's 2 1/2 now -I'm actually kind of glad that they don't make too much noise, those musical toys drive my husband and I up the wall sometimes. I'm in no rush. This takes no batteries, is colorful and fun. If they fill up with water, they get emptied in seconds, it's not like they have to be completely shaken out. She likes to dunk them all the way down and then empty them out. So who cares if they aren't used the way they're ""supposed"" to be, she likes them for what they are. And for most kids, the box is more exciting than the toy inside, so I'm happy this has proved that wrong. I gave it high educational value marks because she likes the colors and matching. The rings on mine don't latch together, which is mis-represented, but again, I don't care about that either. For the price I paid, I already got my money's worth."
1,0,What little boy wouldn't love it because heavy equipment seems to make their little hearts beat faster. Colorful and fun. Ideal for the 4 years old.
0,1,Until I got this game I had forgotten that I played it as a kid growing up.  It is a great card game to play and be able to still visit and pay attention.  Fun for all ages.
1,0,I haven't found anyone to learn this game with me - it has been so long since we played as kids. But I love the memories with family fun times.
0,1,"This is a great value. We've had it for a year and and it's still in great condition. All the colors are bright, nothing is peeling or falling apart. My only complaint is that some of the small states are oddly shaped because they are just too tiny to get right in a wooden puzzle like this. A few of them share one piece. If they didn't, the pieces would get lost, so I don't mind that too much. Overall, I'd buy this again in a heartbeat."
0,1,"This is a really nice, well-made puzzle.  It is large, though.  It's not like the smaller ones you might see at Target.  The pieces fit together nicely, and the information on each piece is interesting to any child wanting to learn the states and their location."
1,0,"I'll confess, I was fairly undecided on whether this toy would be any actual fun. But since my two year old is really into shapes, colors, and simple numbers and I've just confiscated all the scary Melissa & Doug (see:toxic) puzzles in their collection, I thought this might stand as a fair replacement.The kids, 23 months & 4 years, both immediately loved it; ie. The youngest immediately took control of the toy whilst being loudly scolded by the bossy 4-year old on how she wasn't assembling it correctly(!!!!), which quickly spun out of control, and ended up in a draw with both of them letting out an ear-splitting screech. In toddler/preschooler world, I suppose this is a ""two-thumbs up.""After the dust settled, I took a look-see at this new toy, and received a few reprimands from the 4-year old on my unorthodox experiments with it. Namely the totally cool discovery that this toy not only teaches about colors, shapes numbers, with a little dexterity thrown in, but it also fits the bolts and nails that come with theGreen Toys Tool Setthey own, and that it also makes a whole new 'wardrobe' for theirTurnello the Mousetoy that they received for Christmas. My youngest, had she not been in such a tizzy at this point might have approved, but my four-year old insisted this kind of out-of-the-box thinking was a highly unacceptable use of a toy with only one stated purpose.Against her explicit warning, and under her disapproving eye, I continued to compose a little car - that would even roll for a time - though the nuts inevitably fell off, and thus the 'wheels' detached.My four year old, witnessing my experiments, eventually conceded there might be other cool things you could do with these pieces, and built a little neighborhood, with houses made from the 3-peg triangles and 4-peg rectangles, and over-sized people made from 2-peg rectangles topped with a circle. She flipped the board over to use as a mini-table for this project. Then she sat on the board, and we all held our breath thinking one of the pegs might pop off, but it withstood her 30-odd pounds of weight, so that speaks well of the integrity of the workmanship.I bet there are even more uses for these little flat pieces we haven't yet imagined. But I'm so crazy-bored I may just discover them over the course of a few days!In any case, chances are you can find a plethora of ways to use this toy - if the kids will allow it. Our toy seems pretty well-constructed, and it's attractive enough - though more utilitarian in appearance than most of the Plan Toys we own. And actually it's not a bad little teaching tool to have around, even if you do only use it for the stated purpose.And, unlike Melissa & Doug, Plan Toys line of products has been tested extensively - via XRF - by the Ecology Center, with one of the best safety records of any toy on the market. So I feel pretty good about my children playing with this toy, or using the pieces as throwing stars in their endless competition of sibling rivalry. Whatever. They might lose an eye, but at least I won't have to worry about lead and cadmium, so that's something.Bottom line: This is a great toy. Open ended. Educational. Safe. I highly recommend it."
0,1,"This is a great little shape sorter. It helps little ones learn shapes, colors, counting, sorting, stacking...and on and on.  I have seen many kids under 18 months easily master this, so it is a nice substitute for an early puzzle that will not be too frustrating for a little one to do on their own.  However, I have also had 4 and 5 year olds happily play with it too.  We love PlanToys, they are so durable and we are not as worried about the wooden toys going in anyone's mouth.  This toy will easily last to be passed down to even grandchildren, provided you can keep track of all 16 pieces!"
0,1,"I purchased this for my son (who was 18m at the time) thinking that it would be a good first introduction to shapes and colors.  It really was!  He took to it right away and (for all you tired mothers and fathers out there) he stuck with it for a good half hour!  It has pegs for each of the shapes and at first, he was having a little difficulty putting the appropriate shape on the right group of pegs, but he soon figured it out.  The holes in the shapes are large enough so it is not difficult at all to put the shapes on the pegs - sometimes the problem with traditional puzzles.  It is durable - made of really nice wood - made to last!  I love wooden toys - just for the sake of durability and longevity - and this one is really worth it because you really get your money's worth.  Just be careful - as with all puzzle pieces...they are easy to lose around the house."
0,1,"I love this toy!  It is one of our favorites.  Well made, no plastic packaging, colorful!  My kids love playing with this.  We sort by colors, or shapes, or they carry it around singing the &#34;Happy Birthday&#34; song, pretending it is a cake!  We have purchased this for many birthday parties for friends!"
0,1,I thought there would be more light behind the buttons you press for the answers.  Kind of hard to see the answers but the kids are using it so I guess it works and does keep their interest.
0,1,I bought this thinking it would be great way to teach kids their multiplication but it isn't the case. When you press down on the buttons you can hardly see the answers. I remember them being a lot brighter. Very disappointed.
1,0,Great alternative to flashcards & helping kids get those multiplication facts down.  I had one when I was young as well... a great learning tool~
1,0,"I set this on the kitchen table for my 3rd grader, along with the addition/subtraction version for my younger daughter  in kindergarten.  Every morning they have fun taking turns quizzing each other.  Seriously, they actually have fun with this every morning!  Maybe it's the competition of being able to answer as many right as possible, maybe it's fun for them to push the buttons, I don't know why and I don't care.  All I care about, is that they are having fun learning their math facts at breakfast!  By the way, dont believe the other reviews that say you can't see the answer when you push the buttons.  I cannot believe people are actually having trouble seeing the answers!  Either they need glasses, or they have the strength of my one year old who can only push the buttons half-way."
0,1,Got this for my 6 year old son who is really into inventions.  He loves being able to make different things with this set.
1,0,"Bought this for my five yo who plays it in his class.The overall compostion of the game is so cheap. It is like it was made on a copy machine. The cards are paper thin, and will not last over time. After setting up the game, many of the cards were already bent.Next thing is that the directions are somewhat complicated. Maybe I'm impatient, but I just did not get it.There are so many other games that are truly educational and that are well made. I'm just not sure that this is one of them."
0,1,"The Secret Door is a game I have in my gifted classroom. This is definitely a winner. I could see families enjoying this game, as well. The game pieces are a bit subpar in quality, but the game is so different from typical board games that I can look over this problem. I would recommend this game for a gifted classroom and for families."
1,0,I wanted to find a game that my kids could play without tears over losing. This game was great! My kids loved it and had lots of fun sending Max back home!
0,1,"My preschool age daughter loves board games, but I can only take so much of Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders, or Hi Ho Cherry-O.  Max is so much better than the ""regular"" board games you find at stores like Target.  The objective of this game is to get the squirrel, mouse, and bird to safety before the cat Max gets to them.  You roll the dice to determine if Max moves or the little creatures move. When Max gets too close, you can call him back to the starting point for a treat. Kids and adults can work together to try to get the little creatures to safety. My preschool age daughter has no trouble figuring out the rules and she enjoys calling Max back for a treat.  Like I mentioned before, some preschool games get old real quick for adults, but Max is entertaining for all ages. The only complaint that I have is that the pieces are made of cardboard paper. I think it would be more appealing and durable if they have little plastic figures for the animals."
0,1,"We got this for my three year-old to sleep in while staying a hotel.  She had outgrown the whole crib set-up but is such a restless sleeper, she cannot sleep on a bed or even the floor without ending up 15 feet away from where she started.  We got this so she'd have a semi-contained area to sleep in.The set-up is pretty quick and easy.  We set it up once at home to test it out before our trip and that's when we found that the string that holds one of the poles together came out of the end piece.  I contacted Pacific Play Tents as soon as it happened as we were only a few days away from our trip and explained what happened.  They sent me out a replacement piece, no questions asked, very promptly and we had the new piece in time for our trip.  Awesome customer service!The size of the tent was perfect for our daughter and it makes for a nice indoor/outdoor play tent or shade for outdoors.  The ventilation is good and the Velcro flaps/door are a nice size. It folds up very easily and quickly and fits nicely into the provided pouch."
0,1,This is a great gift for all ages especially for my preschooler and her toddler brother. Great size for indoor play- and can't wait to try it outside too. The tent is sturdy and I like that the construction of it requires the child to crawl through the tunnel before reaching the tent. The tunnel does separate easily from the tent though. There is also a door on the side so adults can fit. The best part is the carrying bag so we can put it away neatly when it is not is use. My kids love this item and I think we will be using for many years to come. I would strongly recommend this product to a friend.
1,0,"My son (he's 2) received this tent as a birthday present....and he loves it!  I love the bright colors too.  The tunnel simply inserts into one of the two holes in the tent, and stays put pretty well.  The doors have velcro on the bottom to keep them shut, but nothing really to tie them back with to stay open.  My neighbors, nephew and husband love the tent too, and makes for hours of fun.  Our house is now the ""cool place"" to go do!  I have to agree that I wouldn't bring this tent outside either...the floor seems like it could be ripped pretty easily by something sharp.  But it works great on the carpet, and haven't had any problems with it yet except keeping everyone out of it!"
0,1,"Great for beach or playing in the yard all day.  Nice coverage, pretty easy to get up, not really a &#34;pop-up&#34; though.  Will not keep all bugs out but will keep most of them away.  Great for if you are working outside in the yard and the infant is playing or the baby wants a nap.  Then they can get fresh air and you can get some work done.  Also good for beach, travels small, but there will be sand inside and again, not a &#34;pop-up&#34; so if you are on a beach in the sun, get ready to sweat."
0,1,We loved ths tent.  Our toddler is the type that needs structure and when we travel he has a hard time sleeping.  The tent gives him the structure that he needs and loves.  He used it for nap time and for sleeping at night.  We used the pad from our pack n play that he out grew to give him more comfort.
1,0,"I had purchased Five Crowns from this game maker and thought I would give Set a try. Like many ""simple"" games, this one is harder to master than one might think at first. Set is a pattern identification game and if your mind is bent in that direction, you will do well. Part of the game is also being able to identify when there is NOT a pattern. These aspects make this game a challenge. A great game for folks above about 13 or so. It gets extremely frustrating for kids and my teenager walked away in frustration while the rest of us were hollering out patterns. If you want a game for a family get together that is mostly adults, give this one a try. If you want a game for your family that includes young kids, look for something a little more age appropriate."
0,1,My 2 sons are grown college graduates now but we played this often when they were little. My younger son beat me regularly when he was in elementary school. I think I found Set the year it won the best new game award and it was one of the best games we had through the years. I think I'll pick up a new pack of cards because you can play it solitaire also.
1,0,"My child and husband wont play it with me because I see all the sets almost as soon as the cards are turned. It is way too easy for me and my husband and child have a very hard time finding the sets. They are very smart people, but for some reason at this game we are to unevenly matched to play. They can play it just them too, but they don't like the game much."
0,1,"This game is so much fun.  My 5-year-old loves it.  When he's not playing, my husband and I like to play the more challenging version just the two of us.  We ordered 2 more to give as Christmas gifts this year.  This game is fun and out of the ordinary.  My son is learning patterns, similarities and differences, and reminded of his shapes and colors."
0,1,"We originally purchased this game when my son was 8. He had no trouble playing it then and still loves it now that he is 11. The object of the game is to match three cards in fourcategories:- they have to be all the same color or all different colors (red, green, purple)- they have to be all the same shape or all different shapes (diamond, oval, squiggle)- they have to be all the same number of shapes or all different (1,2,3)- they have to be all the same fill or all different fills (solid, stripes, empty)When you find three cards that match all the above criteria, you call set and collect those cards. The person with the most cards in the end is the winner. The catch is that only 9 cards are shown at any given time (unless there is no possible set and three more cards are added as a last resort).It seems simple and it is but it takes a quick mind to look for the connections.Younger children can play it while the adults take their time and allow for some hunting.All the cards come in a plastic tray with lid to keep them safe for travel and storage.A great game for travel or restaurants to pass the time."
0,1,"So many ""thinking"" games these days cost big bucks, but not SET!  It is basically a pattern recognition game, but MUCH more fun than ""pattern recognition game"" sounds.  My family loves to play SET, and, as others have noted, five year olds can play on a par with adults.I also love the portability of the game - it's good wherever you have to wait, the dentist, the Drs. office, etc...And I also love the fact that you can lose cards and STILL play the game.  Our deck is probably 5 cards short but still going strong.I highly recommend this game."
1,0,"Our experience has been -- the younger the mind, the better the SET player! You play and see for yourself! :)"
1,0,"A friend of mine introduced us to this game after having played it on a missions trip. We sat around our college suite, about 5 of us, as we took 20 minutes trying to get the game. The rules are extremely simple (3 all the same or 3 all different) yet it takes quite the time to fully comprehend. It's best to just try as you go, even if you make errors. And, as I've found out, you'll make an occasional error after years of playing.It's a fantastic pattern-recognition game, and requires much attention. I admit I'm not very good at it, as my visual perception isn't up to par with those I've played, though I still like to play it. It's also a good solitaire game.The cards themselves are constructed similarly as Bicycle poker cards, though not threaded, and, after 5 years of having and playing with my own set, they've held up well.From Christmas parties to late-night sessions, Set is a great game that's easy to set up and easy to put away."
0,1,"Love this game!  Play with kids as young as kindergarten, just play face up.  It does not affect play.  Kids learn basic card strategy.  It is so fun watching the kids get excited as they begin to understand how the game works.  I have taught to any of my kid's friends whenever possible.  So far, have not found a dissatisfied player.  Grown ups and kids alike enjoy it.I can't get enough of this game!  Most fun with 3 or more people, but can be played with 2.  Easy to play with ghost hand.Don't get the wrong idea, this is not just a kid game.  Learned to play with group of adults when we were short partners for Pitch.  Sometimes our Pitch group picks this instead:)We play it a lot. Only complaint is that I wish the cards had a better coating for better durability."
0,1,"I love games that combine luck and skill!  The game itself is like Gin and Rummy in that you need to find  sets or runs and each round progresses in a certain pattern (don't worry it's easy to understand when you start playing!).  You need skill to see the possible sets you can create and play your hand properly to go out before your opponents.  You also need luck, someone lagging all game can suddenly get good hands and, when played correctly, come from behind to win it all!Great for groups of players with various ages.  Easy to learn.  Entertaining for hours.  I would highly recommend this."
0,1,I bought this game as a Christmas gift for our family to enjoy and we've had fun playing it.  It took us a bit to learn the game but once you do it is a lot of fun.  My son (13 yrs) often requests this game.
0,1,A good rummy-type family game that's fun for up to 7 players.  We were introduced to it on a trip to Oregon and came home and promptly ordered it.  Interesting and fun for the whole family!
1,0,"I played this game with my eight and nine year old kids. I am impressed how quickly they caught on to the complicated rules that  change slightly every round of the game. Basically, there are 11 (!!) rounds in this game, and each round, another card is &#34;wild&#34; and each round the size of the hand increases by one card. You can't play this game without a pen, paper, and perhaps even a calculator at the end to tally up the scores.What annoyed me the most was the length of the game. Eleven rounds is veeeeeeeery long. And I paid $11-12 dollars for what is basically a deck of cards. They're not like a deck of normal cards, because they have 5 suits and are missing the 1's and 2's but they are just paper and ink and some instructions. They should have been half that price. I can't really see my family playing it again, as I can't really include my younger kids and they won't be patient for the hour it will take us to finish this game."
0,1,Metal frame and cotton loops are preferred over plastic especially for classroom useI remember doing this activity as a child
0,1,"Lincoln logs are just too expensive. This is a great alternative. It's a big set, but as other reviewers have mentioned there are a lot of the smaller logs. These create support for the longer logs. I don't remember using them that way when I was young, but maybe I just lost the small ones. My 5 yr old enjoys playing with it and log quality seems good. The figures that come with it are junk though."
0,1,My 2yr daughter totally enjoys these. She is unable to lace in a straight line but she's enjoying the lacing anyhow!
0,1,"Lacing cards are a truly wonderful investment.  They're very good for using your mind, imagination, and fine motor skills. These cards are very durable, and there are several different shapes to choose from. Excellent purchase, with a very prompt delivery."
0,1,"INITIALLY:  Extremely disappointed when I took it out of the box because it seemed cheap and flimsy*NOW*: Love Love Love it! My 20-month old absolutely loves playing with this & it is teaching him so many different concepts with such a tiny and simple toy!When I first got this toy, I was a bit disappointed because the ""crepe rubber"" pieces seemed cheap and flimsy. Plus there were little tiny pieces of rubber all over the box and I had to pick some fraying pieces off of some of the shapes. Also the rectangular base didn't seem very sturdy so I just put it away. I wasn't even sure when I would give it to my son because I was worried it'd constantly be shedding little pieces of rubber and that he would pick at the edges and eat them.It's been sitting on my dining room table for a month and I decided to give it to him yesterday. Well he was DELIGHTED as soon as he saw it (he has a lot of toys and usually doesn't act this way when I give him a new toy)! He was squealing and standing and stomping with excitement as he started taking all of the rubber shapes off. He loved taking them off, putting them back on, just looking at them and bending them (they're actually very durable!). I love that there are so many ways to play with this toy...by color, by shape, by pattern, etc.But what I am most happy about with this toy and what stirred me to write this review is that after only playing with it for *one* day, he can put the wooden pegs back into the base. He's a big kid with big hands and this is a GREAT toy for him to work on his fine motor skills. With this toy he has to line up the correct end of the peg to the small hole and also be a little more gentle than he is used to being with toys while still using a bit of strength to push it in. Also I haven't noticed any rubber pieces fraying and he hasn't even tried putting them in his mouth :-).I highly recommend this toy!"
0,1,I guess that is my mistake for not reading the whole product description as I didn't know it was all made out of foam. Like we all know...you get what you paid for...
1,0,"My young kids (6 and under) love these toys. They are small and easy to cary and on the top of that these are educational toys.  Also, some of the pieces are small so my kids did lost few pieces.  I send email to the company and they send me replacement parts.  I will keep buying toys from them."
0,1,"We love this set, it's very durable and the carry-case is a huge bonus.My daughter likes all of it, the lacing shapes and the locktagon construction set especially. Her friends have had fun playing with it too. It's been very durable, and when she grows out of it we will pass it on to someone else. This is a great buy, educational and fun!!"
1,0,"This is a fun game.  The rules are similar to Gin -- get each card in your hand into a straight before your opponent does and you win.  But instead of suits and numbers each card has a letter or pair of letters, and the goal is to make words.  The first hand is 3 cards, the second hand is 4 cards, etc...on up to 13 cards.I like this game because unlike Scrabble, the person with the amazing vocabulary doesn't always win, because several short words are just as effective in using up your cards as one long word.  (In fact, you get a 10 point bonus for either longest word OR most words).  So my 8 year olds aren't outgunned by their word-loving elders.As a nice plus, the art work on the cards themselves is well done.The only minus is that the deck is double sized (110 cards) and so shuffling is a bear.  Would also have been nice if they included a container that held the whole deck (instead it comes with a tray that has slots for 2 half decks.)"
0,1,"Quiddler is an exceptionally easy make-words game. It is good fun for families with pre-teen kids, and there is just enough to the game to enable the parents to enjoy the experience in the family group setting. But 3-4 adults playing with no kids would be bored by this game.Why play Quiddler when your kids could play BananaGrams with you instead?The game is like the Rummy card games, except there is no playing off the cards layed down by anyone (remember, Quiddler is simple, even simplistic). Unfortunately, there are no big point swings in who is winning vs losing. In Rummy games the leading player can get stuck with lots of penalty points in the next round. In theory that can happen in Quiddler, but in practice that is rare.The cards are of high physical quality, except for one problem: the point values printed on the letter cards are in an unnecessarily small font. This means that a person who benefits from reading glasses cannot play without the glasses. There was plenty of space on the cards to make the point values larger.A possible flaw in the rules is that the game sometimes motivates you to not want to form All your cards into words and succeed in getting rid of all your cards. In the few times we played, luckily we did not hit a case where every player was unwilling to end the round. The underlying cause of this flaw relates to my earlier comment that players rarely get stuck with several unplayable cards in their hand, for which they would suffer many penalty points.From this same company, their game SET is better."
1,0,"I've now had this game for years and it continues to be one of the favorites within the household and among the gaming groups I play with.  Particularly enjoyable for those who also enjoy word games in general, and in particular a good game to introduce to Scrabble fans who may not have experience with many/any other word games.  If there is a flaw it's that outcomes tend to be a bit reliant on one's initial draw - it's common to not make it around for even a whole round before someone is able to &#34;lay down.&#34;  That could be a plus, though, if you prefer games that have a fast pace.  And in any case is still a test of skill with creating words given limited resources."
1,0,A fun twist on word games. This game is good for all ages. Even those not that into games have found this one fun. A good family game.
1,0,This card game is a very educational game for our grandchildren. We enjoy it very much. Have lots of fun playing the game with our schol age grandchildren.
0,1,"We love ""SET"" and were excited to play ""Quiddler.""We found the rules to be absurdly complex.  We also found that playing by the rules was not much fun.Just to explain - Quiddler is just a deck of cards with letters and point values on them (and they are beautifully illustrated) - it's a no brainer that you can just deal out cards and see who can make the most words, or the highest point words - it's basically like a deck of Scrabble cards.  And, the game is fun if you play this way.For us, the problem was trying to follow the written directions/rules included with the game - we found them to be absurdly complicated and really not that fun.  We wound up just playing by our own rules.  We enjoyed it mildly, but would probably rather play Bananagrams or Scrabble.This was only our first time playing so, if our opinion changes, I'll update this review.  For now though, it's a weak 2 stars."
0,1,"What a great idea!  I love Scrabble, but even in the magnetic portable versions, it's not quite as portable as I'd like.  Cards are much easier to carry and there's less likelihood of losing a card from a deck than a letter from Scrabble.Both the multi-player and the Solitaire options of this game are a lot of fun.  Plus, there's excellent educational value in both learning to spell and strategize.I'm hoping the company brings out a version of this game for my iPhone. It's a lot of fun and I enjoy the different challenge.Rebecca Kyle, February 2009"
0,1,"This is one of those games that keeps coming out at parties again and again.It's quick and easy to set up and the rules are not complicated.The play goes quickly but fun enough to puzzle your mind and make you laugh.It's easy for most age groups to play, and not slow and hard like scrabble can sometimes get.VERY FUN!!"
0,1,"For years, I have seen this game at the stores and yet it wasn't until now that we decided to give it a try. Wow, we were pleasantly surprised! This game is one of the funnest board games I have played in a while. It is incredibly easy to play. In less than five minutes, we were already having fun. I was amazed that for such a simple Card game, how high the Strategy Factor was. Just like dominoes, almost anyone can play the game but not everyone will actually master it. I can truly say that this is one of the few games that the luck factor doesn't bother me at all. Plus, this is a very flexible group game given that anywhere between 2 to 12 friends can play. If you are searching for a fun, quiet, simple game that requires no overwhelming strategy skills and players from all ages can play together then look no further, you found it. For those interested in more details keep reading:Game Play - 2 or 3 Players can play individually against each other. If more than 3 are playing then everyone plays in teams up to a maximum of three teams, which will not allow 5, 7 or 11 players able to play. This means that if twelve friends are playing, there will be three teams of four players each. Each team will take turns playing a card and placing a token on the board matching the card played with the attempt to place five of their tokens in a row before their opponents do so. There are two types of Jacks in the game. One can be used as a Wild Card, which will allow you to advance your game or block your opponent. The other allows you to remove any token from the board. One set of five in a row wins the game unless being played by 2 or 4 players, which will require 2 sets of five in row to win.Strategy vs. Luck - For a card game the Strategy Factor in incredibly high. How and when to play your Jacks, where to play your tokens, should you block or push forward... the decisions you make will bring you sweet victory of sour defeat. Even with the luck factor, skilled players will hardly ever lose to absent-minded amateurs. I would like to add that this is a no-talking game. Any coaching or signaling will result in penalties, Ha!Awesomeness Factor - As the owner of almost every board game ever made I can assure you that this is a Must Buy for anyone that enjoys having fun. There is a Jumbo Version of this game. I would purchase that one if given the choice, especially if you are planning to play with lager groups.Awesome game for Awesome fun! Enjoy!"
0,1,"This is a really fun and easy game. It's a lot more fun with 4 people playing teams but it can be played with 2 or 3 people just as well. I've never played more than 4 people so I don't know how well that would go. It's a fun game for kids and adults. It's a great game to just sit and chat and dork around and play. It's a lot of fun and does involve a little strategy if you want to take it seriously, which you definitely don't have to. Overall, it's a good versatile game for a variety of people and situations."
0,1,Love this game. played it loads. very easy to learn. lots of fun. We often get this out when friends come over for a meal. it just helps conversation etc.
0,1,I had one of these marble runs when I was a kid and was thrilled when I got to give one to my friend's kid.  It's the type you set up yourself so you can change the course.  Very fun when used in combination with dominoes.
0,1,Our almost five-year-old got this for Christmas and he just loves it.  He builds all sorts of interesting structures and then rolls the marbles down it.  It keeps him busy for hours and he is quick to show it to all visitors.
0,1,The game is as others have described but I don't think anyone mentioned how loud it is!  We bought it for a 5 year old and this is a very noisy game.  She won't tap with the mallet-she bashes!  Excited kid plus plastic mallet equals a lot of noise.
0,1,I was always more of an Ants in the Pants fan myself but I recently played this with my young nephew and he loved it!  It requires less coordination than Ants in the Pants so he enjoyed it more.  For very young children it is a game that they need an adult for since they often don't have the patience or coordination to put the ice back in.  That just means that it's a good game for when playtime is also parent-child bonding time.
0,1,"I have a 3 year old and it can be difficult to find games that aren't too difficult for her but still fun for the rest of us. My kids, ages 6 and 3, were totally excited to play this game as was I until we discovered that you spend more time putting the cubes into the frame than you do actually playing. It's a real pain to put all the little ice blocks in the frame and honestly the last row of blocks is too difficult for the kids. Then, all the kids do is take turns hammering out cubes until the bear falls. My kids seem of pretty average intelligence and this game provided almost no challenge to them or even learning as far as I could tell. They both knew exactly when the bear would fall and that's really only fun once or twice. I think we played it about four times in the past year. I hate to be down on any kind of game that brings the family together or gets kids involved in something away from the tv/computer, but this game is just annoying to set up and dull to play."
0,1,"This is a game I played as a kid and really enjoyed it, so I've passed it on.  It's a bit of a mess at first and cleanup can be tricky but overall it's a great game for kids."
0,1,"My 6 year old just loves this game! So much fun, easy to setup and the playing time is short so keeps the child's interest. We have played it for hours"
0,1,"This is a very exciting game.  My kids discovered this game in their Sunday school church.  They have been playing with it every week and it is a lot of fun.  I can compare the excitement you get when playing Jenga when it is about  to fall, you know it is coming except you don't know if it is gonna happen on your turn.  This is a classic toy/game, it has been around for many years and it doesn't get old.The game is set up with blocks of ice in a square frame.  You place an ice skater on top of one of the blocks and the players start hammering down one block at a time.  The object of the game is not be the player who hammers the last block that will make the ice skater fall down.  It is a very simple to set up and likewise very simple game to understand that even a pre-schooler can start playing in no time.The game is made by Milton Bradley.  It is rated for 3 years old and up.  It can be rated as 3 year old to 100 because there is really no limit in age to enjoy this toy.  Another plus is that this is not a very expensive game."
0,1,"Classically fun game.  My kids loved this years ago, and my grandkids are just as happy to play it.  Takes an adult to set it up, but the fun the kids have makes it worth the trouble."
0,1,This game is a classic and can be used with picture cards before each turn or as a way to practice turn-taking.
1,0,We got this for my son for his first birthday. This is the worlds greatest shape sorter. It holds all the pieces inside the box neatly so they don't get lost. It has a ton of pieces. Each set of pieces is textured so it matches the texture on the box. Also the sets for little faces. It is great. Already in he is able to do several of the shapes.
0,1,THE CHILDREN ENJOY THE SHAPE SORTER! IT'S GOOD FOR THEM TO RECOGNIZE SHAPES AND LEARN HOW TO PLACE SHAPES WHERE IT WILL BE THE RIGHT FIT!
0,1,"Had to have this for my granddaughter.  It brought memories of my own childhood and she loves it!  Great for promoting motor skills, as well as learning the words:  lips, hat, etc.  Very happy with my choice."
0,1,"This toy never gets old. It's your basic, never disappointing Mr Potato Head. We bought it for our 22 month old son and he loves it. He is learning all the names of the parts quickly. You just can't go wrong with this toy."
0,1,"I really think you can never go wrong with Mr. Potato Head ... it teaches kids problem solving and creative thinking, while also letting them practice their small motor skills.  Plus, it's fun!  I've caught myself reliving my childhood by playing with this toy as well.  I will say, at 18 months, my daughter still puts a few of the pieces in her mouth.  So, we took away the earrings and flower so she didn't try to swallow them.The one dissapointment is the suitcase.  I thought it'd be a great way to keep all the pieces together, but ... First, the case falls apart on a regular basis.  It's easy to put back together, but it's a pain to deal with.  Second, it's difficult to simply throw all the pieces into the case - they really have to be put in a certain way to all fit in properly.  I can do it with a few minutes of work, but I can't see my 18-month old having enough patience to do it.  I gave up on the suitcase after a few weeks, and put the pieces in a see-through bin.  The case is a nice idea, but it didn't work for us.  The problems with the case would not stop me from getting this set though - it offers a lot of variety!"
0,1,"Always a fun game, I like Monopoly and the kids' really enjoyed it a lot too.  I would buy again."
1,0,"I grew up playing htis game and just loved it so naturally I thought my kids would love this game too. We have played it once. They have no desire to play it again. ANd, my kids in general so like board games."
0,1,"This is another of the classic games that have enjoyed enduring fame and popularity for good reason. ""Clue"" must surely be to detective games what ""Monopoly"" is to money games.The concept is pretty simple, really: you use cards with various weapons, rooms and people on them and try to work out who the murderer is, where they did the terrible deed and what with. These items are randomly inserted into an envelope that is in the middle of the board. You move around each room, and try to find out what is going on. Who knows: it might be you.While simple, the game is loads of fun and there are certain strategies to it. After the first few times of getting whipped, you will figure them out soon enough. But basically, ""Clue"" is just plain fun and it requires very little to set up and enjoy.Happy hunting! Oh, and by the way, the Butler didn't do it."
0,1,"With paper and pen in hand, we would cross off all the suspects as we knew they were no longer suspect. We did this in a most serious way, determined we would find out who the murderer was, who did it and what they used to do it. Sounds awful, but kids don't think of it that way.Before the game starts, three cards are selected and put into a small paper envelope. Just make sure no one sees the cards.  Then let the game begin and learn to look for clues, analyze the results of your choices and as soon as you think you have figured it out, you can look at the cards. If you are wrong, you are out of the game...so be really sure! I enjoyed this game until I was about 12. I play it now and then with my nieces.~The Rebecca Review"
1,0,"Ok, maybe it's not quite as lofty as Scrabble, but this is one timeless and very fun game.It can be played with two people or more, has no set time limit or set finish point.  It is played by all players at once, no taking turns like in some games where everyone else has to sit around and wait.  Everyone plays off the same set of letters, so there is no difference in players chances for getting a good score, it's all skill.This is one of my very favorite games.  Highly recommended."
0,1,This is a great game for my just turned 5 year old son. He gets the concept and its fun for the family.
0,1,"If you want a simple, fun board game that the children can play without you, this is it. My 3 year old could play this game with her 5 year old sister. Children just move pieces around the board and collect or pay money. BUT, if you want an educational game that teaches your children about money, DON'T BOTHER! The ""money"" comes in $1, $2, $3, $4, and $5 increments, so there's very little math that really needs to go on for the children to play. I had been hoping for just $1, $5, and $10 like real money, but was sorely disappointed."
1,0,Rather than call Boggle Jr a game I would call it an educational tool.It is very boring!It has several dice and each of the sides are labeled w/a letter.There are also flash cards that you put in the holder and cover up the either 3 or 4 letter words and look at the picture to spell the words with the dice.That's basically it.Whoever spells the most words correctly wins.Not the most fun game but would be great to teach or improve childs spelling.
0,1,"I highly recommend this for pre-readers who recognize the letters of the alphabet.  This game reinforces letter recognition and gives kids confidence and insight into reading.  Best of all, it can be played with 1 player!  My 4 year-old loves to play games and gets frustrated when I can't play with her, but this is one she plays by herself!  Very stimulating and educational for 3s and 4s, but they will probably grow out of it once they can read.  My daughter didn't seem to care that she couldn't read before playing this game, but in the past 2 days since I opened the game, she has really shown an interest in learning to read.  Desire to read is very important for pre-readers, and this is the only thing I've found to encourage that besides the most important activity of all - reading to her."
0,1,"PROS: Great hands-on game to motivate/aid your preschooler in learning to identify simple objects, view their word spelt on the card and then to match the letters, one at a time, into words. My daughter gets Boggle Jr. out on her OWN and plays with it quite often and we've had it since Christmas 2003. We also play with it together sometimes. She has improved greatly in both her fine motor skills and her focus/attention span playing this game. Both are Essential skills needed to be ready for kindergarten. And of course, knowing the alphabet and being able to make words and sound them out--which is the first step to reading.CONS: All the letters to the words are capitals so it would be nice if flashcards of lower case letters were included and/or incorporated. Also there should be more than eight dice because sometimes rolling for the letters takes too long. It could be funner if there was an applause button and/or lights that went off when she spelt the word correctly. When I'm watching/helping I do that but when she plays on her own I'm sure that ONE additional feature would be so encouraging to her that she'd  want to play/learn even more!"
0,1,"I never cared for this game, I always thought it was silly and really didn't offer much in the way of strategy or skill.I can't think of anything really good to say about it, but I know it's been around for some time, so some people must get into it.  If you like strategy and logic or word games like I do, you'll probably want to pass on this one."
0,1,"LIFE has many ups, and downs, and this game doesn't stress it enough. Here you make a bad move, and you could turn out fine. Ultimately, the world is no piece of cake. Losing your job is a HUGE deal. Having a baby is no small undertaking, as in this game.Yes, it is just a game, but children could be mislead."
1,0,What happened to the old version of this game??? Why is there a need to change games where there was nothing wrong?I use to love this game and still do just miss the old version!
0,1,My 8 year old is obsessed with this.  We got this for Christmas and have played it several times.  It's a lot of fun and perhaps it will influence their career decisions?????  ;)
0,1,"This is one of my favorite games.  It is also an excellent way to enrich one's vocabulary.  To this day I recommend using a dictionary when you play just to be sure no neologisms sneak in.  Still, the extent to which other players will try to win can be as fun as the game itself.  I love this game!"
0,1,"A great way to pass time, teach kids how to spell and learn the meaning and purpose of words. Definatley to be played with a dictionary (I suggest the Oxford scrabble dictionary which not only tells you if words are valid but also gives their true scrabble score!) It's a good laerning curve but can cause lots of heated debate!!"
0,1,"I got this for my 2.5 year old son because I remember having so much fun with it when I was a child.  The pictures have gotten much better.  My son is a little young to actually play the game yet, but we have fun finding the different pictures in the pile...plus working on vocabulary.  Whoever designed the pictures, must have toddlers, because they are all pictures they are interested in like pizza, cookies, dinosaurs, puppies, monkeys, etc.  Very durable for carboard."
0,1,"My daughter just turned two, so she is too young to use it as a memory game.  She likes to match the cards when they are faces up.  I break it down to 9 pairs at a time so it is not too overwhelming."
0,1,I pulled this game out originally to work with my recently diagnosed autistic son on matching pictures of like objects.  He was actually really good at it and could complete the entire box of sets.  He is now 3 and we are doing 5-6 sets of matching. He is definitely not ready for the entire game but he is learning a lot about the basics of the game while we are leading up to playing it like it was intended.  My 18 month old now loves to match up the like pictures.  Great for building vocabulary and sorting into categories (foods/animals).  We haven't even used this game how it was intended and its been AWESOME for my at home preschool program with my two children.
1,0,"I and my 4 year old son haven't found this game to be that much fun, but I've found it to be of poor quality as parts fit loosely or too tight (heads may easily fall off the body) and male attachment parts too easily break off and get left in the holes.Also, ""MADE IN MEXICO WITH DIE MADE IN CHINA""."
0,1,A great gift for an &#34;almost&#34; four-year-old.  The only problemis sticking the Cootie parts into the cardboard.  We decidedwe would just play without doing that and it was much easier.
1,0,I gave a five star rating because is a fun game for children.I purchased this game for my 5 year old grandaughter and  She loves  it.I highly recommend this product.
0,1,"My [...]daughter loves Guess Who and we play it every evening.  I actually ordered another set because the picture shown has different people than the one we have.  Thought it would be fun to have some new faces.  Unfortunately, we did not receive the one pictured, just another of the one we have.  Oh well, I will just give it as a gift to someone else."
0,1,"My 4 and 10 year old both enjoy this game as well as my husband and myself.  Some children's games are just not enjoyable for adults but this one is more fun than many.  Easy rules.  The hardest part for young children to learn is which peple to flip down after you ask a question.  This game uses process of elimination and grouping like features such as facial hair, glasses, female/male, hair color, hat, and eye color.  Overall a fun game!  I like that there are people of light and dark skin but would be nice to show people of different cultures."
0,1,This is a great game.  It's easy for younger kids to play and the rounds are quick.  Assembly is a bit of a pain and after time some of the cards start to fall out.  We actually just use one of the flip boards now and pass it back and forth to whoever is guessing.Well worth the money.
0,1,"This is a great game. I remember playing it as a kid with another child who spoke French. Lots of fun, easy to play, not determined by chance, teaches children how to group into categories and narrow down choices - wonderful.Unfortunately, the new edition is very shoddily designed. The cards are flimsy, and they fall right out of their holders when they're flipped (or sometimes when they're *not* flipped).Ultimately, the game is almost totally unplayable!This is very disappointing to all of us. I'm going to go see if I can find a vintage copy of this game, and I'll be contacting the manufacturer about this as well... though if I have an experience similar to that of a previous poster, I'll probably get brushed off."
0,1,"We play this almost everytime that we have guests!  When we play with kids, we use one word responses to each category... but when we play with adults, we use the multiple word responses for each category.  This game can be adapted this way so everyone gets an enjoyable time playing.  My girls are 4 and 5, so we don't write them down... but instead read the category, roll the letter dice... and take turns thinking up a response (starting with the youngest).  They love it!When we play with adults, we get crazy... coming up with some totally off-beat responses, so we don't match the other players answers (you get no points if your answer matches another players - so no cheating in this game!)  We always end up laughing so hard we fall out of our chair, or can't even read our own answers to the group!!This game should be on the game shelf in every house!!!"
0,1,"I've played Scattergories since it first came out in the 80s. I'm glad they finally put new categories in the new edition. Also, I found a way to work around that annoying loud ticking timer. You can use a three minute egg timer or the Boggle game timer. Same amount of time."
0,1,"I was skeptical when my daughter got this for Christmas, but the game has some minor improvements over the classic that bored me as a (admitedly too old) kid. Most importantly, the addition of the bird was a great idea; when the spinner lands on the bird, another piece of the bird puzzle must be assembled, adding a ""race against the bird"" element that can allow all players to be on the same team or even allow a single child to play the game by themselves, trying to get all the fruit picked alone before the bird is done. Secondly, but less importantly, making four kinds of fruit instead of just cherries makes the game more fun to look at and play. My 3-year-old daughter loves this game and (unlike many other games) she doesn't get bored with following the rules."
0,1,"I loved the game Hi Ho Cherry-O as a child. I think it was my favorite and both my boys have also enjoyed playing it.The object of the game is to be the first player to get all your cherries off your tree and into your bucket. Each player is given a tree and 10 cherries to place on it. On your turn you spin the spinner. If the spinner lands on a number, you get to remove that many cherries from your tree and put them in your bucket. But watch out for the dog or the bird. If you land on them, you must take two cherries from your bucket and put them back on your tree. The spilled bucket symbol is the worst. If you land on that, you must remove all your cherries from your bucket and put them back on your tree. The first person to remove all 10 of their cherries from their tree and yell HI HO CHERRY-O is the winner.The game is recommended for children three to six. You will need two to four players for this game. The game encourages number recognition, counting and as they get older you can incorporate addition and subtraction. As my son got older, if he had two cherries in his bucket and he added three more, I would ask him how many cherries he would have after adding the three to his existing two. We did the same concept when he subtracted cherries.I think Hi Ho Cherry-O is a great first counting game for any youngster, but will be enjoyed by old and young alike."
0,1,I bought this for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas and we're loving playing it!  It brings back memories of playing this with my grandmother.  Great for teaching math skills and strategy!
0,1,"I have been playing Yahtzee since I was 6, and I get as much enjoyment out of it now at age 37 as I did over 30 years ago. If you've never played the game, you are in for a treat. Players role 5 dice and try to rack up points by rolling the most 1's, 2's, 3's, 4's, 5's, 6's, straights, full house, etc. And if you get 5 of one kind? Yahtzee! A big score!Strategy plays a big role in this game, and it can easily be said that half the games I lose, I do so because of my mistakes.Yahtzee is a true family classic."
0,1,They're just score cards! This is a great game the whole family enjoys. I have a 6 year old daughter that likes it. Okay maybe she likes shaking the dice (I had to line the cup with felt to keep the noise down).
0,1,"While of course you can just keep score on any old sheet of paper, these score cards do make it easier.  They're great to have around for new players who are still getting the hang of it.  It helps when kids are keeping score too!"
0,1,"My parents have had a Deluxe Scrabble board as long as I can remember (I'm 25).  This board is a step up for a regular scrabble board and looks stylish, but is not near the quality of their board.  The plastic dividers between grids are very short - maybe 1 mm high.  The material underneath the grid (with double score, triple word score, etc. printed on it) seems to raise up and not lay flat against the board.  I do like how each tile holder gives you the # of tiles for each letter.  The board does raise up very high (compared with the old version) when you use the turntable.  All in all, I'm definitely happy to have a Scrabble board for my own house and I will enjoy playing it with my husband.  However, I do agree with the other reviewers that this is a step down from the old board.  A few inexpensive improvements could have made a big difference."
0,1,Scrabble is an old favorite that will be around forever. It's a great game to play for two or more players. You start off with seven randomly choosen letters and have to create words that connect to eachother all over the board all while racking up as many points as you can with each letter. it's a great thinking game... get's you digging through your mind's vocabulary bank and using your internal spell-checker. Educational and fun at the same time.
0,1,I remember playing with these when I was little.  I was excites to get them for my son for Christmas. They were a fun gift and he enjoys playing with them
0,1,"This game is actually pretty challenging because of the small size of the pieces and the short amount of time you are given.  I like it because it strengthens hand-eye coordination, but I am an adult and usually can't beat this game.  If you want your child to have a challenge that they won't soon outgrow, consider this game."
0,1,"My only complaint is the sticker decal that needs to be put on the timer area should be made out of a plastic based sticker instead of a paper based sticker.  I accidentally tore it when trying to apply it and now that it isn't ""perfect"" it is annoying, especially considering it is a brand new game."
0,1,My kids laugh and laugh at playing this game!  They love taking turns to see who can get it filled up the quickest before the timer goes off!!!  It encourages them to be competitive and is fun enough for Moms & Dads to participate.  WE LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,1,"I suppose you get what you pay for, but I have a hard time coming to terms with the $60 price tag this puzzle game currently has on it. Perfection is a really cool way to train your hand eye coordination as well as your fine motor skills. The concept is simple. You have a series of shapes that need to fit in their proper slot, only the game has a mechanical timer and the slots are on a spring board that will pop them all out when the timer runs out. The challenge is to get them in the slots and stop the timer before that. Fun stuff.The game is self contained and needs no batteries. The timer and springboard are mechanical. The pieces are stored in a handy compartment that you slide out so less risk of losing any. The game is pretty much good for all ages as long as they are old enough to fit the pieces in. For the younger ones it's good even without using the timer for training the fingers.What kills me is the price. $60 is prohibitively expensive for a simple game. You can get the Perfection Travel Edition for under $15 and it's essentially the same game but smaller. Does the price mark up really have to be four times between the two? I'm guessing because it's mechanical assembly costs more, but still.  It is a good game, just not at that price."
0,1,"I'd never seen this game before but it's turned out to be one of my two kids' favorite games. It's fun to play with just the pieces and to make simple patterns for decoration when you're not playing the ""official"" game, and throwing the lever that dumps the pieces out of the bottom is exciting, noisy and fun. Really a great game with real play value, a favorite! BUY IT!!!"
0,1,"The goal of this game is so simple yet so difficult. The first player to get four in a row wins. That four in a row can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. The key is to think of dropping your piece in a place where you have more than one option going.Connect Four is like vertical tic-tac-toe, except it's four pieces in a row instead of three. The board is a vertical piece of plastic that is a grid. Each vertical row has a place on the top where you can drop your ""checker"" down the row and they stack on top of each other. You can see them through circles in the plastic. Each row is divided so pieces don't fall or roll into other rows.The game is to be played by two players and suggested for seven-year-olds and older. One player uses the black checkers and the other uses the red ones. Each player takes a turn and drops one checker into the game board. I still haven't figured out if it's better to go first or second! The player that strategically places his or her checkers so that four line up in a row wins the game.Ok, so it sounds simple, but let me tell you that it can get very complicated. You have to watch out for those sneaky moves. The best player I ever encountered used to work out a plan in his head where he would work on two sides of the board. Then with one drop of a checker, he would have two options to make four in a row and I could only block one of them. Ugh! That is so frustrating, especially when you know he's setting it up and can't see it coming. But then again, when I did see it coming and could either block it before it happened, or sneak one of my own double whammy's on him, it was pure bliss!This game has been called ""helter-skelter checkers"" among other things and could possibly be mistaken for a haphazard game of chance. The problem you'll encounter is that if you make a bad move, that may haunt you for the entire game and you'll be playing defensively the entire time.So don't be fooled by the simplistic appearance of this game. And the first few times you play it the game will probably only last a few moves. But be warned: The more you play, the more difficult it will be to conquer your opponent! This game has almost as much strategy involved as a good game of chess.There are only a couple of negatives to this game. The black and red pieces can be easily lost and are difficult to replace, as their size is unique and a regular checker from a different game won't work. The board itself is a tad bit flimsy, so don't get frustrated and smack it around or fling it across the room. Once it breaks, you'll be buying a whole new game.And now for a line of attack if you're interested -- play offensively. That means don't get suckered into blocking every move your opponent makes. Let them stack a few together before you block it and keep to your game plan. The best way is to try to fool your opponent into blocking one of your moves, only to have what they may call an optical illusion come about that lets you place a piece on an entirely different row. Now with that fourth row, the fourth piece falls into place, declaring them the winner. Huh? Ok, so you have three going vertical and when the other guy blocks that, it sets you up to drop a piece on top and have a diagonal four in a row. There's nothing better than a sneaky win like that to bring about a smile.For an inexpensive, fun and challenging game, I'd suggest adding this to your Christmas list or list of games to play on the next Family Game Night!"
0,1,"I had this game growing up and have played it with my children as well.  My game from childhood is still in fine shape and was used regularly, but we took care of it and didn't fight over it or drop it.  I can see how this game may break if misused a little.  Anyway--it's a fun game and easy for little ones to pick up, but as other reviewers have said once you are well versed then it boils down to who goes first.  I recommend for age 4 to 8 or 10."
0,1,"As a parent and having played this game when I was a child and enjoying it very much then, I have to say that the way that Milton Bradley has modified their old fashioned games is pretty bad.  I remember the game when I was a child, the marbles were larger and the hippos as well, however playing the game was much more easier.  In this one we found a lot of incoveniences.Examples:  The marbles are very small and light, not suitable for children under 4, they often jump OFF the game board to the floor and if you have wood or tiled floor you'd have to run to get them.  The hippos would often detach from the main board while in game play, knowing children who are sometimes hyperactive this is a NO-NO.  My children who are only 5 & 6 (they were 4 & 5 last christmas) would be so excited playing the game when some of the mentioned things happened and could not keep up with marbles all over the floor.  In other words if a parent is not present the marbles will get lost under the surrounding furniture.  I just got tired of running after them.I also bought Operation also by Milton Bradley, don't even get me started there.  Quite a dissapointment as well.  With these modifications the fun of the games is gone.  The marbles from Hungry Hippos are nowhere to be found and the game is sitting there doing nothing, next step is the trash."
0,1,"My daughter absolutely loves this game!  It is one of her favorite games.  My only complaint is, WHY o WHY couldn't they have put an on / off switch on this game!  We stack our games up on the shelves and if you place any games on top of this larger box game it will start quacking and is impossible to get to shut off!  I considered taking the batteries out but you must unscrew the compartment.  What a hassle for each time you want to play.  Even though this game quacks all the time, the batteries have held out well and structurally it has held out excellent considering we are always beating on the box to get it to shut up!  If the company would but a shut off button on this game, I would quickly throw this one in the trash and race off to buy one with a shut off button.  Still a great game for children."
1,0,I thought these were the larger size play dohs but they were tiny. My fault for not paying attention but my kids are happy nonetheless
1,0,"These smaller than regular size tubs are difficult to open.  No child can do it, my fingers are still sore from prying the different color tubs open, because of course she had to try every color right away."
1,0,love this buggy bought one 9 yrs ago. Handle got better but wheels aren't as good. Baby is 9 mths and loves going around the house in it. Can't wait for the weather to get warm.  Front compartment is great for wipes and a couple of diapers. Also big enough for a few small toys.
0,1,"We were visiting someone in the children's hospital which is where we first saw this toy - my daughter really seemed to enjoy being pushed around in it so we decided to buy her one for Christmas.  Hands down it's her most favorite thing to do now!  It's too cold to take it outside now, so my husband and I push her around the house and she smiles and laughs!  She could probably do this all day long!We had initially bought her a different car, the Chicco 4 in 1 Ride On car, which we thought might be better because it changed from a rocker to a self-push car for when she's older.  But, in fact she didn't like it very much.  I think part of it was that the seat was so wide that it forced her legs to spread out and it wasn't comfortable.  She never wanted to be on it, so we returned it to the store.  This Step 2 car is very comfortable for her."
0,1,"I bought this car for my 18 month old daughter.  I can't begin to tell you how much she loves it!!  We keep it in our garage and when I come home from work and open the garage door, she runs out to her little car, sits down and attempts to seat belt herself in!!!!  We often use it if we're going to a strip mall or department store - - it keeps her much happier than sitting in a stroller!  One of her favorite parts is the trunk in front - she stores various items in there (cups, dolls, etc...)  The other thing I like is that her feet are inside the car - it's not the kind of car that the kids propel themselves.  The only problem is that sometimes she'll drag her feet outside of the car and I find myself repeating ""feet in the car!!""  Also, I agree with other reviewers that the tires are noisy on pavement and it would be great to have some sort of rubber tires.  It would probably make the car more expensive, though....  And yes, the handle was hard to put in.  We still haven't gotten the pin in all the way.Nonetheless, this is definitely a must have toy.  My daugher LOVES it!!!!"
1,0,"We recently purchased this toy for our daughter who is about to turn one year old.My little girl gets bored sitting in the stroller.  But she LOVES riding in her car.  So this is a Godsend for us to go on walks or just run errands.  We can take her out in this car and she laughs and giggles and waves at people as she ""drives"" along.  The trunk space in the front is larger than I expected and will hold the things we need for her along with my keys and phone.The handle is a comfortable height for both of us to push and everywhere we go other kids rush to play on it too.  We had a hard time getting our friends' 3 year old out of it!We are using the car now as we would a stroller.  Sure, there's not as much storage space or a cupholder, but our little girl is happy and smiling.  It also gets attention as she rolls along, much more than in a regular stroller, and our little one thrives on the extra smiles and waves she gets from other people walking by."
0,1,"My son loves this. He got it as a gift for his 1st birthday, and he's been enamored with it since. It's great for walks when they decide they don't like strollers anymore. And our 6-year-old daughter loves pushing him around in it too. So it's really great overall. We actually bought this one as a Christmas present for another toddler, because we've received so many comments from strangers that we thought we should share the enjoyment with another family."
0,1,"Recalling how I was mesmerized by my Slinky ""walking"" down our stairs as a child in the 1960's, I was really looking forward to introducing my 5 year old grandson to this classic toy.  (I purchased a ""Slinky Jr."" at the retail level, which was a complete waste of money... I promised my grandson I'd purchase a ""REAL"" Slinky, like Grandma had when she was his age.)  Finding the price seemed reasonable on Amazon, I purchased one, just received it this week, and went to give it an initial nostalgic ""workout"" prior to sharing what I remembered as a wonderful toy with him.  Well, it does NOT walk down stairs, and only does the initial ""flip"" when on the floor!  Maybe it was only $5, but I don't believe in throwing money out of the window!  What a shame that they - somehow - changed this product so that it no longer performs like the REAL ""original""!  So disappointed was I in this purchase that I wanted to try to figure out what ""happened"" to that great old Slinky.  Even though, as the box claims, it WAS invented in 1946, the inventor died in 1974, and his wife sold it to ""Poof Products"", the current manufacturer, in 1998.  I don't think the inventor would be too pleased with how they've changed his product over the past few years!  I didn't bother reading reviews prior to purchasing, because of the ""original"" label, but now that I've read over the first few pages of these reviews, I noticed something --- the 4 & 5 star ratings for the product are dated 2008 & prior (except for one reviewer who used them to keep out squirrels instead of as a toy)... the reviews from 2011, 2012 & 2013 are all rated only 1 or 2 stars, so they DID change something, and this is NOT the ""original"" Slinky! What a shame that the company this was product was sold to (Poof) tinkered with a classic."
0,1,"sure this doesn't make the popular clanking sound going down the stairs as the metal originals, but it still works well, and has been copied by many companies.  I even have one with a business name on it.  These fun, functional, and keep a kids imagination engaged.  No noise or batteries needed.  Buy someone you know this for a stocking stuffer this year."
0,1,"This thing takes a beating. My son is 3 and I wasn't sure how it would hold up to his abuse. But it's been great. I don't like the fact that you can't pick the color, but took a chance."
0,1,"This product was a little smaller than I expected, but our 14-month old son still loves it!  He mostly drags it around the house and watches its eyes move and the wheels spin.  He puts the receiver up to his ear, but the cord is only about 6&#34; long so he picks up the whole phone with it. Still a good buy though."
0,1,"The phone cord and pull string are way too short. I understand cords have been shortened for safety reasons, but the cords are so short, it negates the usefulness of the product. I'm not even remotely impressed with the Chatter Phone."
1,0,"Smaller then expected, but still cute. My son liked it and still plays with it sometimes. Not sure if I would have bought it if I knew the size of it though."
0,1,Just like the kind you remember from when you're a kid. This is such a hot phone. It is so fun.
0,1,This classic Toddlerz Chatter Telephone does exactly what the one you and I had.  The eyes roll back and forth when the phone is rolled along.  The handset lifts from the phone and the dial is a nice little history lesson for the kids as well as an exercise to improve hand coordination.  My 18-month-old granddaughter loves her daddy's old pull-toy airplane so I thought she'd like this and she sure does.  She pulled it all around my house as soon as she opened the box.
0,1,"I was really excited to see this toy because it reminded me of the one I had when I was little.  My only issue is the too long pull cord.  I was going to cut it at first, but then decided to take the phone apart and put it inside the phone.  That way I can take it back out when my son is older."
1,0,I bought this item for my 4 month old grandson. This kind of toy has been in the household for years. My two year old has one and he uses it to call his uncles.
0,1,"This toy was given to our daughter when she was 14 months old-she started walking right around then.  She didn't really use it at first, because she couldn't lean on it to walk-it would fall, unlike her push walker she was used to.  She took to it fairly quickly, though, and still loves it now.  We say ""pop, pop, pop"" when she uses it and she's started saying ""pop"" when looking for it.  The toy helped her learn to walk balanced as well as working on her talking skills!"
1,0,"I think most of us had one of these toys when we were small and still recall playing with it.  My little one is no different.  We bought him the singing one (it plays ""Ten Little Indians"" and counts as the balls pop) which is absolutely marvelous.  It doesn't bother me any more than any other toy he has and honestly, it is possible to tune out the noise!  It's great fun for him and he just loves running his ""opkorn macquine"" all over the place.  The cat's tail is a favorite roadway, as are many, many other unpaved objects but, he's having fun and that's all that counts.  No pun intended, but he loves to count with the child in the voice box whenever the balls pop.  It's very educational and very fun.  Besides, the popcorn balls even light up now!  What more could you ask for?  Wish mine would have!"
1,0,Great toy for 20 month old who loved pushing it everywhere. A little noisy but that was why he liked it.
0,1,"This toy is still a winner after all these years.  Our son now 2 still has great fun with it.  He pushes it all over the house, up and down the street etc...  He spotted it in a baby depot and started pushing it.  Needless to say, it left the store with us popping the whole way.  I rated the educational value a 4, pretty high, because I thought it taught cause and effect very well.  The toy is durable, cheap, and I highly recommend it."
0,1,"One of the toys that gets played with the most in our house. I don't really understand the appeal, whether it's the bright colours, the bouncing balls or the obnoxious amount of noise it makes; my toddler & 1 year old are constantly fighting over it."
1,0,"Good price and service, my grand daughter loves to push it all over the house, I get such a kick out of watching her play with it."
0,1,"My 1 1/2 year old daughter loves this toy! it is nicely made, but parents be aware, it is very loud when the balls pop in it. Dont get it if you dont like loud toys."
0,1,"My 12mo daughter loves the balls INSIDE the toy. She wants them. She wants to eat them. If they pop, she tries to grab them. She rolls the toy as she's sitting and hasn't figured that she can actually push the toy while walking."
0,1,"We got this for our daughter's first birthday in reliance on the MANY GLOWING reviews here and on the recommendation from the Oppeheimer Toy Portfolio.  It is a great, and inexpensive, present for a child who is already walking.  It has not been as big of a hit as we thought it would be, but it does get a lot of use -- we have got more than our $12 worth.  She is 15 months now and I suspect it will continue to be in play.  I get a kick out of her having the same toy I did way back when.Note that I had to go out of my way to get one that just pops (the way mine did when I was little) and doesn't count, recite the ABCs, or do other developmentally inappropriate ""educational"" things."
1,0,This makes as much noise as you remember! My toddler grandson loves it and pulls or pushes it as he walks.  It is a great &#34;traditional&#34; toy.
0,1,"I had to buy this classic, and of course she loved it. She's 2 now and still plays w/it. Very durable, easy to clean if it is used outside."
0,1,"We purchased this for our son's frist Birthday.He loves it and right away picked it up and started popping corn.He started walking at 10 mths so he has great balance.He really enjoys his popper outside on the sidewalk.If you have a little one and you happen to run across a popper in the store, don't hesitate putting one in their hands.It just might be a have too purchase."
1,0,"I bought one of these for my kids and now for my great grandson who it 1.  He loves to play with it, but hasn't quite learned he is supposed to walk and push it yet.  He plays with it by pushing it while he is sitting on the floor.  He loves the noise it makes and it is colorful and sturdy."
0,1,This is a fun toy that my children enjoyed and now my grandchildren enjoy. Noisy but other than that it is great.
0,1,"I remember playing with this toy as a child so I am thrilled to see my 1 year old daughter enjoying it as well.  It is extremely durable, it stands up to being chewed on, stepped on, and put in the dishwasher.  It has been fun to see her understanding of this toy progress from the time she first got it at 3 months until now, and beyond."
1,0,All you really need to know is that it's a classic toy that every baby should have and that your kid will love.
1,0,My ten month old son has been playing with these rings for several months now.  He loves to tip them over and roll them.
0,1,My son absolutely loves playing with this toy. He goes really crazy when I put it in front of him and he basically nose dives towards it. He loves smacking the rings against other toys and chewing on them. He is not of age to understand how to stack them but he still loves the toy.
0,1,"Simple yet fun, this brightly colored plastic ring toy is the perfect first baby toy for any child.  Teaches colors, coordination, and balance.  I have had ours since our first daughter's birth more than two years ago and it still holds her attention as she learns new motor skills at each stage of development.In the beginning it's just fun for a baby to look at, touching it to cause the base to rock back and forth without toppling over.  Then as baby learns to remove the ""Lifesaver Styled"" rings, they become familiar with how they each fit on the rack.Color recognition comes later, and of course we always had fun playing peek-a-boo with our eyes hidden inside each hole!  As our kids became more imaginative, they pretended the rings were donuts and served them up on their tea set.The toy is durable, quick to clean, easy to store or take along on trips.  This Fisher Price old time favorite is a must-have goodie for your baby's toy box."
1,0,"My son has had this toy since he was 6 months old. He's 11 months old now. He plays with all kinds of toys and enjoys them, but has never cared anything about this toy, past using the rings as chew toys.  It's a pretty boring toy."
0,1,"I agree with the other reviewers here. This is a classic toy, teaches colors, sorting and stacking. It is great toy. Low price. Easy to play with, good toy to chew on (teething times), easy to clean. Toy that will last longer than they will want to play with it. My two still enjoys playing with this wonderful toy. Our Rock-A-Stack has 3 little balls on the last tube, makes it into a rattle, which my  youngest son (10 months) enjoys shaking.You can't be the price, we bought ours for $2."
0,1,"I bought this toy for my 11 month old grandson, who loves to hold things in his hand and put things to his mouth.  His 2 1/2 yr. old sister also enjoyed it, calling the rings &#34;donuts&#34; and playing they were food.  She also could count the rings and name the colors......so it was interesting to see how the toy was perceived at various levels of development. This toy will grow with the child."
1,0,"I dont know whats the exact purpose of the toy. My child was never attracted to it other than its colors. But with use, the colors on the rings fade away..."
1,0,the greatest - safe - helps baby to learn for sure
0,1,This is always a classic toy that kids will always enjoy.  Loved it!  Got it for my grandson's first birthday and their aunt loved it too!
0,1,"LOW PRICE, Easy to play with, Easy to Clean. This was a present for my older son first Christmas. He will pull these out on occasion and play with these for a good while. My 10 month old loves to chew on these. He also enjoys playing with these in the bathtub."
0,1,"Our toddler loves his beads so much that he's got two whole sets!  He  still struggles to pop them together but popping them apart is a  blast...not to mention he still loves to chew on them and of course, throw  them!  There are no bells or whistles on these beads, they don't need  batteries but they last a lifetime.  Every child I've known has loved these  beads.  I'm looking forward to using them to teach colors to him!"
1,0,It is terrific. My little one loves it. He can do it all by himself.  He rides it all over the house. Make sure you have a lot of room!!!
0,1,"This 1st birthday present is still in frequent use 6 months later. It was super easy to put together, snap, twist, done. It is very sturdy and very easy to ride. Two little ones can squeeze on in tandem. The design makes it difficult to tip over, due to the fairly wide stance. All surfaces are smooth and it is just about as safe as could be."
1,0,"We got this to play with my 3 year old son.  The concept is very fun.  You spin a spinner and it lands on a part of the face; then you get to pick out a nose, mouth, eyes, etc. and stick it on your card.  The first person to complete a face wins!The face pieces are fun and goofy and highly amusing to all of us and it is a fun game.The problem is with the durability.  After playing it once or twice none of the colorform pieces will stick to the faces anymore. They all curl up and fall off.  This is frustrating to me and incredibly frustrating to my three year old.  We can clean them off and flatten them and then they work for a little bit again.The spinner is also poor quality, it gets stuck a lot and is in general hard to spin.  I guess not a bit deal, but it is just one more thing to hassle with.Personally I would recommendCootieover this game if you want a type of building game."
0,1,"Item is durable. Bought it for my 2 year old girl. At first she was not into using it for golf but just used her hands to throw the balls and used the clubs like bats or tried to hit things with the club, like the dog and cat. She is now almost 3 and has more interest in the toy now and will take it out and ask me or her nanny to play with her. She is able to hit the balls better though she does not hold the club exactly right (she tries to use it with one hand instead of with two and with the club head turned in rather that out) but she definitely enjoys using it from time to time now. There were some reviews about the clubs sliding out from the holster in the club case. I found this was the case with mine too but by accident realized that the holster that holds the clubs just needed to be snapped into place all the way in the back and then the clubs fit in fine and have not slid out since. The clubs and balls are durable. Overally I am very happy with the purchase. I think one improvement would have been to give you an extra set of balls with the case. Its easy for the balls to get lost as they roll really fast on hard surface, like tile. I would recommend this product of any parent, but thing it might be better suited for a child that is at least 3."
1,0,"Our two and a half year old son received this as a Christmas present and loves it.  Unlike other reviews, he has no difficulty putting together and taking apart that various parts of the toy.  Perhaps we got lucky and got a box that has parts that don't fit together too tightly.There are 16 white &#34;base&#34; pieces that fit together in an unlimited number of configurations.  After the user puts all the base pieces together, you can then insert a four-pegged &#34;axle&#34; into the base which in turn will hold one of several different sized gears.  The challenge is to lay out the gears so that the teeth of the adjacent gear(s) interlock just enough to spin freely when user turns the initial gear.  The layout of the base pieces and the gears are only limited by the user's imagination.With normal play, our son doesn't have any problems with the pieces coming apart or separating from each other as others have commented about in their reviews.  When he begins to spin the gears too fast, or gets a little rough with them, then the base or gears begin to separate -- as is to be expected.  Also, we've found that working on a hard surface such as a table top or hardwood floor works much better than building the game on a soft surface such as a carpeted floor or sofa cushion.The gears are colorful.  Some have stickers, some don't.  The stickers have cool patterns that make interesting effects when the gears are rotating.  All the pieces are made from plastic durable enough for normal play.After I help him put all the gears together, and before he turns the crank to spin the gears, I'll ask him which direction a specific gear will turn.  This makes him think about how the gears are interconnected with each other and the fact that adjacent gears rotate in opposite directions of each other.  This is how I turn a fun game into an educational game.  When he gets it right, we high-five.If your kids like hands-on games and like creating things, I'm sure they'll love this toy."
0,1,"i like that the board can be seperated and re-shaped, but my 4 year old finds it difficult to push them all the way together. There are plastic pins on the bottom of the gears to hold them to the board, but they break easily. The spinning colors are just stickers that will wear off soon. Despite the fustration of lining up everything i like the idea of this toy. I encourage parents to interact and show how precise a geared machine must be to operate."
0,1,"My daughter loves to set up weather scenarios with this.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the pieces don't always stick very well.  I've caught my daughter licking them to get them to stick (so needless to say I have to wash them one in a while).  Other than that, it's fun & educational and my 3 year old gets it out to play with it at least every couple of weeks.  :)"
0,1,Don't waist your money. I bought 2 you can hardly see the lines and the nobs don't work very well. In the trash
1,0,"We've had it a couple weeks.  No problems so far, but it just seems cheaply made.  It erases very fast and easy."
0,1,"All the adults at the birthday party for the 2 years old played with the Etch A Sketch!  The honoree was playing with lots of gifts, so  didn't get much upset!  He does like to draw, and this will let him draw all he wants without leaving pieces of paper all over the houseand missing pencils.  He did get to use it when he opened it, and was interested in using knobs to draw, instead of a pencil.  I recommend that it be given by itself, instead of 20 or so other gifts!I definitely recommend it, especially for kids who like to draw."
1,0,"I am not a kid. In fact it's been quite a few decades since I last held that title. Five minutes with the Classic Etch A Sketch Magic Screen and I was transported right back to the 1960's with my flat top haircut and Keds sneakers. I spent many a happy hour trying to wrestle an artistic masterpiece out of the two dials on the Etch A Sketch.As far as I can tell, this version is exactly the same as the one I played with so many years ago. The lines are dark and easy to see. Turn the Etch A Sketch upside down and shake a few times and all marks of the screen completely disappear and you are ready for another round of two handed dial induced artistic fun.This is a great toy. It teaches spatial relationships, hand to eye coordination and logical deduction while expressing artistic flair. Every child should own an Etch A Sketch at some point. For the price, you will never find a better toy."
0,1,"I have not met a person who is not spellbound (at least for a few minutes) by the etch a sketch. What fun it is to sit and try to control the dials and create a picture. I had one as a child and loved it. Then when I had children of my own I wanted them to have one too. Glad we have one for them now, they truly enjoy it! Mind you it is not a video game but it still does draw their attention and is great to have around."
0,1,"This is a great game for parties or casual get-togethers. The rules are simple but once you start playing you realize how hard it is to picture the maze changing in your mind. Many times, you'll move a tile only to realize you just messed yourself up instead of making the amazing connection you thought you saw.Highly recommend this for 3 or 4 players. With 2 players it's OK but it's too easy to plan ahead to your next move. With 3 or 4 players you have to adapt your strategy constantly because by the time your turn comes again the board has totally changed.This is a game where you can still have a conversation going at the table without ruining the flow of the game, but it demands enough attention that people don't lose interest in it. Kids from the age of about 7 or 8 can play."
1,0,"This is a fabulous game!  First of all, the game mechanic is so simple, anyone can learn how to play it in less than a minute.  So whenever I have friends who aren't into boardgaming over at my house, I pull this one out.At the beginning of the game, you deal out treasure cards.  The aim of the players is to reach the tile on which the treasure is printed.  You do this by pushing tiles.  As the players push the tiles the layout of the labyrinth changes.  You can play this game with two to four players.  With two players, it's more strategic since you have to worry about getting your treasures and preventing the other player from getting his.  With larger number of players, the game becomes more chaotic and exciting because the labyrinth will be completely different by the time you get your turn again.Basically, you should get this game.  The simple gameplay combined with a high level of replayability makes this a must-have boardgame."
0,1,"My boy and his friends simply love this game.  It is simple but catchy enough.  Best of all, a good way to coral four boys."
0,1,"BOUGHT 2 OF THESE, I JUST LOVE CRAYONS. YOU GET 120 IN EACH BOX. I AM A CRAYON, FREAK. DID GET THESE FOR MYSELF. LOVE CRAYOLA. DEE"
0,1,When a kid i never got a box over 64. Love those colors. Midnight blue was my favorite. It looks good outlined. Light and dark contrast. Some childhood things are good to have back. I searched and it is in one of the boxes. Wish someone would design easy color coding access. In 48 box the lower box can be hard to get crayons out of. Two crayons were broken when i opened. Cute idea but would like in one box for myself. A child might like to take a reduced amount to school. 48 instead of taking all of them so this would work for such. Crayon sharpener lid comes off for emptying.

0,1,grandson loves em - So do I cause the &#34;washable&#34; works SO well :)
0,1,Great price and lots of colors to choose from.  I bought a few and will use them as add-on birthday gifts for kids.
0,1,"my daughter has had hours of fun drawing on my driveway with these. At this price, you can't ask for more."
0,1,"My 2 1/2 and 4 year olds love this game. They acually take turns and I have peace and quiet for about 20 minutes! There are 2 ways to play. One way for beginners that are learning their shapes and the other way for kids who already know their shapes. Very cute, and incredibly strong plastic!"
0,1,"I got this for my son, it is a smashing little toy, but it is not durable. It broke within 2 days so I wouldn't recommend for small children."
0,1,This toy is a cute toy.  My son has enjoyed him although I will say due to the bendable slinky part it is a bit fragile.Would buy again though.
1,0,"My daughter got this toy for Christmas at age 2.5 years. When we first opened the box, I discovered that it came with a list of possible ways to play with the pegs and the pegboard. I used that as a guide very briefly, but found that my daughter knew what to do--which is anything she wanted to do! She likes building tall towers. This morning she built a series of towers and each one represented a member of our family. Creative play! She particularly likes when I will sit and play with her. I make patterns for her to copy, or encourage her to sort by color. This toy is not fancy, but it's very versatile. There are a lot of things you can do with it. I feel like the best educational toys are ones that the child can explore at his or her own pace and apply toddler logic and imagination. I can see the little wheels turning in my daughter's head when she plays with it. If you appreciate this type of toy, I think the Lauri Toys Tall-Stacker Pegs and Pegboard Set is a good choice for your toddler."
0,1,"My 23m son looooooves this toy! It's so simple but so brilliant! He stacks the pegs on the pegboard, stacks them without using the pegboard, and for occupational therapy his therapist has him push the pegs into the pegboard, then turn the board over and have him push the pegs out from the bottom (his fingers just barely fit in the little holes). Works his pincer grasp, index finger, and thumb."
0,1,"This toy is a great idea.  Kids think and experiment until they find a configuration that works.  That aspect of it is great.  What I don't care for is the brittle plastic.  Several pieces cracked the first few times we played with it.  And that was supervised play at the table, no rough stuff.  Some of the pcs don't fit together easily, and any kind of pressure causes the plastic to crack.  We have used lots of superglue and salvaged everything so far, but kind of a drag that it is so fragile."
0,1,"Got this used.  Baby didn't become interested in this until she was 4 months old.  She is 5 months old now and is now starting to grow bored of it.  I attached different toys to it, which kept her interest a little longer.  I just take off the bars and use the mat now for playing on the floor.  Really glad I didn't spend the money on this."
1,0,"The best part about this toy is that it takes no batteries and makes no noise.  That's such a rarity with baby toys these days.  The second best part is that it's made of wood, not plastic.  I'm so tired of plastic.I bought this for my 10-month old and he likes it a lot, both as a teether and as a motor skills toy.  The elastic band used to keep the parts together is very strong and has endured a lot of hard use from me (I mess with this toy when I see it and I'm very hard on toys).  Its colors are bright and friendly and it can make all kinds of neat designs, which also interests my 4-year old.The simplicity of this toy is one of its biggest appeals.  Highly recommended."
0,1,"I purchased 3 HABA rattles for my daughter, the Triangle Rattle, Magica, and Max.  She is 4 months old and so far the triangle is hands down her favorite.  It's advantages over the two others: it's lighter, easier for little hands to grasp (she can get a thumb around the sections), easier to chew on, and (for me) fits nicely into a pocket in the diaper bag.  A love the sound it makes, it's quite pleasant and not loud enough to be disruptive in a quiet setting.  There is no risk of anything being pinched when this goes in her mouth (something that has been reported with the HABA Kringelring).  Very happy with this one.  It's made in Germany."
0,1,Our Early Childhood class had one of these & my daughter was immediately drawn to it so I bought one for at home.  I love it because it's bright and it easily hooks to the chain that I would attach to her stroller or car seat.  I also like that it is wood instead of plastic.
0,1,A little bright noise maker! Perfect for an infant to hold and shake and eat of course. I will be buying these for all the babies in my life.
0,1,"My son loves, loves, loves these!  They are really beautiful blocks and the wagon makes for easy storage.  Made in the USA!!!  He really enjoys stacking them high and then knocking them down.  We use them to learn animals, numbers, letters and symbols.  Excellent job, Uncle Goose!"
0,1,"I bought this set actually to spell out things like ""3 months"" for baby photos of my daughter.I could not be happier1. The blocks are gorgeous2. They have an authentic vintage feel3. The paint does not chip and stands up to baby chewing4. The edges are not sharp5. They are arranged so that you won't be struggling to find another E or A or whatever letter you need.  Smart arrangements over the blocks6. The pull wagon itself is a wonderful toy great for both storage and playing.  Bunny loves to ride in this wagon!This is an heirloom toy that your own child might pass down someday.  Truly a classic with quality and design that isn't that common these days."
0,1,"These ABC blocks by Uncle Goose are the best made blocks you will find anywhere. I looked everywhere to find blocks for my 15 month old. Most are for 3 and up because they are too small and too destructable. Not these blocks! These are 1.75 inches each and have 100% safe paint for babies and up. My 15 month old chews on everything and she was not able to bite the paint off of these blocks, like she was easily able to with most other blocks on the market that I returned! The animal carvings on the blocks are really nice. They have numbers, A - Z and 27 animals for toddlers to look at. My child loves playing with these and stacking them up then knocking them down.  I wanted to be sure she had these blocks for her 1st birthday. You can't go wrong with this classic toy. It is excellently made and very fun! A must have for all children ages 1 and up."
1,0,"These are what they claim to be, blocks.  Nice, well made.  You build with them and knock them down.  A good purchase and I bought another set for them so now they have 3 sets of these.  I would even buy more if inclined to do so in the future.  I like blocks.  Good in so many ways for the developing children."
0,1,great price for this item and was here in no time very pleased with it. would recommmend to any one
1,0,I bought two of these adaptors for my grandchildren to use in their home so I don't have to keep buying batteries.  They work great.
0,1,This is self-explanatory.  This item arrived and works as expected.  Have only been using for a few months and is still working just fine.
0,1,"This DOES NOT charge it. I thought the unit had internal batteries, but the only thing you can do is spend your life savings on AA's or buy the rechargeable ones. It works fine for plugging up to the wall and keeping it from dying, but I was disappointed to find out it didn't charge it."
0,1,"I love the fact that I bought this for my daughter but, by son is able to use it as well, great buy, no issues, sometimes I wish the cord was a lil longer, but other than that it was a good deal."
1,0,My son now does not burn through so many batteries. A wonderful idea for the little ones that have all these new devices.
0,1,Love the 3D touch to this globe. Our son always looking for stuff in it making stories and looking how far he would go :)
0,1,"I purchased this ball for my 9 month old niece.  She loves it and it is a lot of fun.  As you roll it, the chimes inside provide lovely listening.  The colors are very eye-catching. It's a good gift because she can play with her 3 year old sister.  I recommend it highly."
1,0,"We bought this puzzle for my son when he was 18 months old because he is so crazy about fish. I didn't think he would be able to work the fishing rod to ""catch"" the fish, but he picked it up right away! It took him a while to be able to put the pieces back in the right places, but he still loved just fishing them out and then bringing them to me to put all of the pieces back in. We had to shorten the string on the rod to make it a bit easier, but other than that this puzzle is perfect. My son is now 2 years old and continues to really enjoy this puzzle and plays with it almost every single day. As with all Doug & Melissa toys, it very high quality and well made."
0,1,This is the real rubies cube!  What fun to have one to play with again.It was a bit sticky to use at first.  Great fun.
1,0,"When the Rubik's Cube first hit the US market over 30 years ago, demand far outstripped supply. Imitations hit the market very quickly. Although cheaper in price, they were inevitably lower in quality. How much difference this makes all depends on whether you consider this a game or a puzzle.The package insert says that there are billions of combinations and only one solution. In reality, there are a potentially unlimited number of solutions and quintillions of permutations. The exact number is a matter of interpretation, but in general terms, the idea is to end up with each face having a solid color.As a game, the goal is to complete the process, often as quickly as possible. As a puzzle, the goal is to solve it (figure out how to achieve that) preferably in as few moves as possible. As a game, the player need not understand how to solve anything, but could merely learn a set of instructions that allow manipulating segments that are in a certain position and getting them to different positions and/or orientations. A player need not think about how the sequences accomplish that, only that they do.Imitations of this product can be frustrating. The segments can bind, and stickers can peel off. On the other hand, some imitations can be purchased at a ""dollar store"" and have molded plastic colors that cannot peel off. This product has a solid feel, and rotates relatively smoothly. If your goal is to complete it as  quickly as possible, that can be very important. Some players will sand segments or lubricate them to get the segments to rotate as quickly as possible, regardless of the effects on the life of the cube.  As a puzzle, that should not be necessary, and the quality of the build can make this much more enjoyable than an imitation product.The package claims to contain solution hints. There's nothing there that discusses strategy or even why you would want to complete things in the order given. Instead it takes the ""follow me until the process is completed"" approach.  It makes it easy to learn how to complete the puzzle, but is a poor guide for learning how to solve it. The original cube came with no instructions, and the general view was that only a genius might be able to solve it, except perhaps by extremely improbable accident. I knew far too many people who tried to solve things one face at a time without regard to the relative positions of the colors on the other faces of the very pieces they were positioning. That view changed once a book was published showing that it was possible for an average person to complete it by following instructions. If you truly want to solve it on your own, keep in mind the relationship between each piece and the adjacent centers of each square, and why solving in layers could (but is not necessary in order to) lead to a solution.Conceptually, the center segment of each side stays in the same relative place no matter how the cube is twisted. Thus the correct position of each piece depends on the color of the bordering two or three middle tiles. Since it is impossible to move one piece without moving others, the task involves moving pieces without disturbing others, disturbing their positions only temporarily, or simultaneously positioning them while positioning others or placing others in a position more amenable to repositioning. The ""solution"" in the booklet explains how to do this by completing the puzzle in layers. However, it is impossible to do it that way. If you complete the first layer, completing the second one involves undoing each corner piece on the top layer temporarily. Initially having them in the ""wrong"" position will not necessarily slow you down and may even speed you up.Thus one is truly solving the first two layers simultaneously but with many extra moves if one uses the enclosed instructions. Likewise, to position pieces in the bottom layer (which becomes the top at this point) rather than telling you that the task is to move certain pieces out of the way temporarily, rotate something to put others in a certain position, move the original piece back and so forth, the instructions merely say that if you hold the cube with a certain visible pattern and follow a certain sequence of moves, you will end up with a new orientation and can move on to the next step.  The final task of getting the corners into proper orientation is by far the hardest part to follow, but the easiest part to execute. It boils down to repeating a series of four turns continuously until a corner is facing the correct way, moving another corner to that position, and repeating the process until you are done. Trying to follow what is happening to the other segments during the process, and why and how they end up where you want them, is daunting. Yet you can pay no attention to that part whatsoever and the instructions even advise that. They tell you not to worry about where other pieces end up after completing the sequence for each corner but to take it on faith that things will all work out. It's all built on the ""trust me"" principle.If you are into it as a game, this cube can help speed things up for you. But it's a bit like buying a $3000 bicycle to shave off a few ounces when you could afford to lose 25 pounds of body fat. It makes sense to get the bicycle if you are already in top form, and it makes sense to learn how to shave off moves, rather than making your fingers more nimble and solving things by rote using the included instructions.If you are looking to solve this as a puzzle, it would make more sense to learn strategy and the instructions effectively give you none. If you execute the sequences in the instructions and try to map out in your mind (or on paper) what happened, why you needed to move certain pieces to certain places before turning others, where they end up relative to each other, which ones flip over, which ones end up in different relative places, and which ones end up back where they started while allowing others to end up in correct position, you might be able to figure out strategies on your own. You might want to work through sequences, see what you end up with, then walk through them backwards to see what caused things to happen. You should see that many of the turns are unnecessary given the pieces that will need moving in the near future, and intermingling sequences or changing the order could be a better strategy. For example, if the first two turns in a sequence place a piece next to another that remains next to it throughout the rest of the sequence, an extra twist or two ahead of time could cause pieces to align in the middle of a sequence, stay that way, and cut out a future sequence entirely. Or if it forces another piece (that's irrelevant to the current sequence) to end up where it will be simple to reposition with a subsequent sequence, it could save time. Sometimes, pieces unrelated to your immediate task will be in a good position relative to each other, and an extra twist in the middle of a sequence will keep them from being disturbed but not prevent that sequence from accomplishing its goal.Thus, even with the ""instructions"" you will still need to solve it on your own but need not complete it on your own. When it was first introduced, it was a puzzle and you might enjoy it more if you treat it as one. Otherwise, it could be a nice alternative to a video game where the next level is always your goal."
0,1,"I like this toy.  I thought about getting the gears building table by the same company, Learning Resources, but that's about $150 once you get the gears to go with it, and this set serves the same purpose.  The only difference is that you have to build a platform with the square bases first, but that's fine with me.  This also takes up less room.  I love how open ended this toy is, but it would have gotten a full 5 stars if there were different sizes of gears in it.  I plan to purchase an additional set so we get more pieces."
1,0,"Wife bought this 2 years ago (son was 4 at the time), now shopping for X-mas again.  Wanted to share this with others.  We build together, and come up with crazy ideas.  Keeps him entertained, and loves taking apart and rebuilding.  Very durable large pieces.  Only issue is the cracnk handle comes off sometime...when we get it going to fast.  A great buy for the money for years."
0,1,I must admit I didn't read the description like I should have.  I thought the blocks were included but this is for the PLATE only.  And it does not work with the smaller blocks.
0,1,It is exactly what it says it is - a lego plate.  It is the size it says it is.  And as usual Amazon sent it very quickly.
1,0,"This is what it is.  It's a big clock with hands that you can manipulate.  We love it.  It's made well, it shipped quickly, and it's served it's purpose.  If you want to work on time-telling with your kiddos, this is a great clock to meet those needs.  Inexpensive, easy to use.  Highly recommend."
0,1,"A quarter (coin) sitting next to it for a scale for reference to size would have helped.  Nothing burns my *ss more than getting a simple gift and finding out it is even more simple than I anticipated.  I wanted a clock for my 2 year old to tinker with.  This clock is not durable and it is not for a toddler.I would think twice before buying this unless you are in a controlled environment and/or using it with a very slow-moving child.  This clock is ""dinky"" and tiny.  Nothing more.Have fun."
1,0,"I order this for my 4 year old son to help him learn to tell time. I think the concept is great, but the product could be made better. I guess you get what you pay for though! Already, it seems that that hand's are a little ""off""."
1,0,"I've purchased several wooden trains for use on my son's wooden railway and I have been quite impressed with the quality of the Thomas and Friends Trains.  They are very well made and use large plastic wheels that run easily over small imperfections in the track.As with most character goods, the Thomas and Friends Trains come at a premium price, but careful shopping can sometimes net a bargain and I recommend you seek these toys out over lower priced rivals.  They are worth the extra time and trouble to get."
0,1,"We got this train when it was on sale for around $5, my boys love it  and have had fun since we got it."
0,1,I only really wanted the Coal Car.  It is too bad they do not make an &#34;Edward&#34; in a battery operated unit.
0,1,Fun and great train Henery and green is my favorite color.  I am going through a craze of collecting these fun trains.
0,1,Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway - Henry the Green Engine --- arrived on time and grandkids have been playing with all engines for more than a year and having so much fun with the whole set
0,1,"I was a railway fanatic when I was a little child; and now my son is, too, and probably more so than I ever was, thanks to the art and science of modern marketing. He wants Thomas this and Thomas that. He loves Gordon -- I guess most kids love Gordon because he's big and powerful. This hardwood toy looks nice, but doesn't seem very durable -- my son dropped it once and the wheel bases got really loose, to the point that we may need to buy another one.  Also, these toys are made in China, and the trees they cut down to make these are from China, too, so I guess the cost to manufacture is probably 50 cents, but they charge U.S. consumers twenty bucks.  Makes me wish I were in the toys trade."
1,0,"This is a very nice addition to any Thomas Wooden Railway collection. I purchased this for my son and he really enjoys it. It is durable and very detailed, just like the other Thomas Wooden items. If your child is a Thomas fan, this would be perfect for him=)"
1,0,"I got this for my 2 and 4 year olds to play with the Thomas train table. It is made well, after months of play everyday I do seesome chip in paint but nothing major."
1,0,"I purchased Percy for my son - a huge Thomas (or any train) fan. Within 20 minutes of opening the package, the paint was peeled off in 4 different places. I don't know if it was missing in 3 spots already, but at least 1 was done after he got it. I wrote to the company, but haven't heard back from the yet. I hope this is a fluke, as I would love to get the collection for my son, but will not spend that kind of money on trains that won't hold up."
0,1,"My son has several Thomas trains, and he really likes Percy.  He has a warm smiling face, and the colors are very vivid.  The construnction is very durable, which makes for hours of fun.  The magnets are strong and enable Percy to pull several other cars.  All of the toys of the Thomas collection are excellent choices for young children. They will surely enjoy this fun toys."
0,1,"My grandson loves playing with his beloved trains. I'm happy with their construction and the fact that it is NOT battery powered. He loves pushing the trains around his track, keeps him happily occupied for long periods of time."
0,1,"Another great friend of Thomas and a great addition for my 2 year old grandson for his Thomas train set, best prices are on amazon."
0,1,Kids just love this toy.  They can play all day with it!  Also this toy is very durable.This toy is a must!
0,1,KINDA EXPENISVE FOR SUCH A SMALL ITEM BUT MY GRANDSON DEFINITLY IS LOVING IT... THANK YOU SO MUCH... HAVE A GREAT DAY!
0,1,I bought this for my grandson to add to his Thomas the Train set. He loves it and this is something he can grow with in addition to the train set.
0,1,My  two-year-old grandson knows all the characters in the Thomas series and has quite a collection of them.  He knew all about Harold but had only a &#34;generic&#34; helicopter.  He was delighted to receive the &#34;real&#34; thing.
1,0,This was my 2 year old grandson's absolutely favorite toy at Christmas.  He simply loves it and has spent many days playing with it and talking to it.  It's well made and stands up to rough play.
1,0,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my three-year old son who loves all things train related.  He couldn't wait to play with it as soon as he opened the box and it has continued to be one of his favorite pieces to his train set.  Three months later he still plays with it almost daily, both as part of the train track set up and just carrying it around the house.I've been pleased with the durability.  My son plays with his toys pretty hard and I was nervous that the arm might easily break.  No problems there, though.  Cranky's head did come off once, but I was easily able to snap it back on and it's only happened once in the three months we've had the toy.  He was able to figure out how to raise and lower the magnet using the crank pretty quickly.  The magnet works well; it easily lifts the boxcar that comes with the set and can also lift the engines and other train cars he already has using their magnetic ends.The one thing I was surprised by was that there's not a way to actually connect Cranky to the track--you just have to kind of set him next to the track layout.  Which I guess makes sense now that I think about it; I had just assumed when we ordered it that he would actually connect someway.  But its actually easier just being able to put him where you want him.  It's a nice addition for a Thomas layout."
0,1,"I know, I know...  the Thomas stuff is listed for ages 3+.  I'll let those of you who didn't buy a single solitary Thomas thing until your kids turned 3 cast the stones and...  I'll bet I won't see a whole lot of stones.We got this for my son when he was 2 1/2ish.  My son is about to turn 3 in a week and Cranky is kind of in need of replacement.  Not that I will be replacing him, since that is a lot of money to put out for one toy of such limited use and value to begin with.  But at the time I bought it, Cranky was ten bucks off at TRU and seemed like a good toilet training incentive.  (It was!)Well, my son has had a lot of fun with Cranky.  I don't know why he likes him so much, but he does.  The problem is...  Cranky's head comes off.  Just like everyone is saying.  It's not a huge deal, as it is easy enough for mom or dad to pop back on, but the neck and neck hole of the head are kind of D shaped, so the head has to be lined up just so, which makes it more of a challenge (and frustration) for a child.  And it comes off ALL THE TIME, more and more easily as time goes by.  That's the first problem...  and maybe it's really not a HUGE problem, for all I know, if Cranky's head wasn't made to pop off, maybe it would have been BROKEN off by now.  Who knows?The other problem is, Cranky no longer cranks quite right.  If you turn the knob...  the magnet will lower about an inch and a half, two inches...  then nothing will happen for a bit...  then it will just drop down to the bottom.  Then you can wind it up and it repeats.I have taken Cranky apart and I can't seem to fix this.Now, fortunately, my son doesn't seem to mind a whole lot, as he is content to carry Cranky around by his [severed] head while chanting ""Cranky the CRANE.  Cranky the CRANE."" over and over.  Then he will just sort of manually use the head/magnet to pick stuff up.  So the fun is still there but...  for the money, this toy really ought to hold up a little better.  And for what it's worth, I have absolutely no reason whatsoever to think that, had I waited until November 16 to give Cranky to my son, there would be any possibility that Cranky would not be decapitated and poorly cranking 6 months later.  This is just not a durable toy.My son has fun with it, but it's just not all it's cracked (cranked?) up to be.FWIW, though, you can get this great little tow truck with wooden shapes at IKEA - it's a great companion to Cranky.  Cranky and the tow truck can both pick up the shapes.  I think my son has had more fun playing with those items together, than just setting Cranky next to the track and using him as intended.Also - if you have nothing Thomas related yet, consider going the ""take along"" route instead.  The cars are more detailed and cost less.  Cranky costs less in this line.  Of course they made it so you can't use take-along Cranky with the wooden sets by affixing TA Cranky to a piece of TA track.  Maybe you can just turn him around, I don't know.  Just something to look into."
0,1,"We gave this to our 3-year-old son for Christmas - not without some trepidation, given all the reviews reporting constant Cranky decapitations! However, there was no possible substitute as my son had specifically asked Santa to bring him Cranky the Crane. Not wanting to disappoint, and very confident in my husband's ability to put Cranky back together again should we have a severed head incident, I decided to take a chance with the purchase. I'm so glad that I did.When he arrived, I took Cranky out of the box very gingerly. As I tested Cranky's levers, he seemed sturdy enough. Turn one crank, and he rotates 355 degrees in one direction. Turn it the other way, and he rotates back the other way. Turn the other crank, and it lowers and raises the magnet. I knew Cranky would be loved like the Velveteen Rabbit, if he could only survive being ""loved"" by my son. The true test came after Christmas morning. My son only had eyes for Cranky, sitting bravely under the Christmas tree, adorned with a big red bow and a tag with my son's name on it.I am happy to report that our Cranky's head is still firmly attached, despite having been repeatedly knocked over by ""hurricanes,"" bashed into by giant monster trucks and kicked/trampled by preschool and adult feet. So far we have had a combined total of 20 play hours in two-and-a half days without one guillotine incident...Cranky still lives!True, our Cranky is still young, but for now I am giving him a clean bill of health. I will keep monitoring his health.Update from June 2013 - our Cranky is still just fine, as good as new!"
0,1,Every lego fan needs these plates to build their creations. My kids have several of these in various colors and they work great to keep their creations together.
1,0,All other sets only come with very small area to build on and since I bought the 704 Lego pieces I wanted him to have a larger area to build on. I'm sure he will love it.
0,1,"These didn't come with any set we already owned so we had to buy them!They're a must have for building anything a bit larger and for setting up Lego scenes using minifigures.It's hard to rate something so basic, but these are the quality I've come to expect from Lego."
1,0,"My son and I like this product.  It makes it easier to build houses and other buildings. However, it is a little flimsy. It's hard to use on carpet.  It needs to be on a hard surface when pushing Legos on it."
0,1,"If someone you know likes building with Legos, they are going to need a building plate. It opens up even more possibilities to the world of Lego creation. The price on Amazon was the best price I saw. Totally worth it."
0,1,This are hard to find in stores. When you do they are way overprices. The board is strong and a great size for kids to build something cool. Really happy I found this.
1,0,"My husband played with these as a child, so did I, Years later I am buying them for my children and they love it. I hughly recommend it, its durable, as long as they don't purposely bend it. Hours of fun"
0,1,These building plates are very handy to have if you or your kids like to play with Legos. My daughter has used it quite a bit to build things on. It came in perfect condition. No bends or anything. Now she says she needs a blue one and a tan one!
1,0,It's a good base for the Legos. It fits perfectly in the lego city zip bin. My son uses it all the time.
0,1,Good price and great addition to my kid's lego set because it is much bigger than the one included in hers.  Wish it came with regular sets and in other colors.
1,0,"Very thin, bendable building plate. Legos stay on well, but still need to build on a hard surface and isn't strong enough to pick up and carry far without worrying about the plate bending. Would be nice if this size was a bit stronger."
0,1,This building Plate by Lego was a Christmas gift.  I am assuming it was a grand surprise along with the other gifts. It is a plate for children to use when building etc. a building.
1,0,"Great for building anything, you don't need to be connecting base plates to each other all of the time, just build away!!"
0,1,"These are expensive and essential if one wishes to display, or keep together, a lego item.  As much as legos cost, these should be provided with the larger sets. Legos lose value when they are crumbled!"
0,1,"It's really helpful to have a base plate when putting together all those little Lego collections. My daughter set up several of the little Friends animal home sets on this one, so she had a little animal neighborhood."
1,0,"I was totally surprised at the flimsy-ness of the plate.  It's nice and big, but pretty flimsy.  It still works. You just need to have something under it to keep the bricks from popping off it, so I give it an average score. Adequate, but not great."
1,0,i bought this toy about two years ago and I still haven't had to change the batteries! my three year old son LOVES to play with this and spends a lot of time practicing his letters. well worth the money. very durable and i too love that there are no pieces to lose.
0,1,"I ordered this for some kids I know who are 12 and 14. Even the adults enjoyed it. It was a real hit, sturdy, colorful, and it got passed around all day as everyone wanted to play with it and analyze it."
0,1,My 11 y/o son received this as a Christmas gift...he loves it!  What is there not to like honestly?!  :)  If your children are into anything cool like this...I'd suggest this inexpensive set.
0,1,This little dog is too cute. My grandaughter has been watching Beverly Hills Chihuahua movies so I got it for her (not able to find at any store) and she loves it.
0,1,"This is great for any kid who is a fan of Hot Wheels.  The case works well for storage around the house, it prevents cars from getting lost and makes sure parents won't step on them.  This is also a very convenient case for when kids want to take them over to a friend's house."
1,0,car have a place to be put away and the kids can carry it with them.all in one place. nice!
1,0,"This is a great case for lots of cars. We have had it for over a year and it is still in perfect condition. It has a few large slots for bigger cars/jets, but most of them are small and hold one to two hot wheels cars."
0,1,"This thing fell apart almost instantly. Cheap plastic with a giant sticker on it, they just don't make things like they used to."
0,1,"This car case is not fancy. It does not (as many people have noted) hold 48 cars in isolated perfection. However, if you are looking for containment and moderate protection, it will hold more like 60-70. Our daughter is fairly careful with how she packs her case, so we haven't noticed any undue wear. If you are looking to keep your cars in mint condition, you'll want to use a different strategy."
1,0,I couldn't find this in any store--thanks Amazon!  It was a gift for my 4 yr. grandson.  I put a few new cars in and he'll have space for the rest at home.  His TrashPack cans fit in as well as smaller action figures.  There are some larger compartments for vehicles that are bigger than the typical  $1.00 size Hotwheels cars.  I'll bet the other brand fits as well.  Hoping the latch lasts for quite awhile.
0,1,I'm not sure what others are complaining about with poor quality unless over the last few years it has declined. We've had our Radio Flyer wagon for about 12 years and it is beautifully made. The sides all lift out (6 pieces total) and the bottom is smooth and nicely finished wood. It maneuvers easily and the handle allows for easy turns. The tires are really rugged and have carried my kids over gravel and rough roads.We store ours indoors so it had held up very nicely. I wouldn't store it outside for any reason. It is not plastic and will not last in the searing sun for days or the rain.We do hose our our and let it dry before putting it away.
0,1,I purchased this for my granddaughter and she loves it.  We spent hours walking thru the house in the wagon before it was nice enough to go outside.  I like that the side rails are removable so she can climb in and our.  One tip...it needs a pad in the bottom when we hit bumps outside.
0,1,"This is the BEST wagon all around, but especially for the beach- the sand is NO problem for these big tires. I've also thought it was excellent for other, uneven terrain and the tires make it a very comfortable ride. Our daughter has been in this since she was two & is now six. It does need a lot of padding since its a wood box with rails so her old changing table pad and a couple of small pillows are in there. I do have the clamp canopy and it's great but it broke pretty fast, but hey that's another review.Anyhow I do recommend this for the reasons I've stated and the staying power. It's well worth the money.When we're done w/it we can use it as a garden/flea market cart or for picnics, etc."
0,1,The game I received was never used but the box was all beat up and torn. I bought it as a gift so I could not give anyone that box. I emailed the company that sold it to me and they told me to throw it away and they refunded my money. Most companies make you return the product and pay to ship it back to them. Not this one! I was unhappy with the product and they were extremely nice and sincere when they apologized. I am happy with their excellent customer service.
0,1,"Cheap, this is cheap and not worth the money I paid for it! It broke soon after we go it! Do not buy!"
0,1,"This toy works wonderfully!  The rockets fly really high and it's not too complicated for a child to play with independently.  The rockets easily get stuck in trees, so play it in an open area.  The fins on the rockets don't stay on well.  I had to super glue a couple of them on -- but they still work fine now!  I have a rough 4 year old, so I keep super glue handy for just about everything!"
0,1,This is a fun and powerful toy. I am impressed with the height that these rockets can reach. I had fun along with the kids.
0,1,"Not a lot to it... and I thought... how great can this thing really be.  And while we got it out and my son started to use it, I still don't understand what the big deal is... But my son loved it and has a blast using it.  So that is all that matters and I am happy."
0,1,"Fun product. Endless hours of fun at a park, yard or beach. Both kids and adults enjoy stomping on it. I would suggest to buy extra rockets. We use it in our yard but if there is a slight breeze then they sometimes end up on the roof!"
0,1,"This is our default present we buy for birthday parties for kids 2 and over. Everyone loves it, from the kids to adults. So much fun!"
0,1,This item olooked like a lot of fun and it turned out that it made a big hit with the girl who received it as well as her cousins.
0,1,"I gave these to my 6-year-old grandsons for Christmas. We got to play with them the day after Christmas before the snow hit us.They loved them, and all the parts of the toys held up well even though it was a mighty cold day."
0,1,"I bought this for my 5 yr old.  She and her 2.5 yr old sister play with this for hours.  The younger just likes to get the rockets and bring them back, but she does not have the wieght to make it go yet.  For under fourteen bucks, this is a lot of fun and good outdoor exercise, not to mention the hidden science lesson about trajectory.  My best value for Christmas 2012."
0,1,We previously had another stomp rocket set and this one is certainly an upgrade! The tube mounts to the stand and even the smallest kid can launch these rockets (our previous set required an adult foot to get the rocket off the ground).
0,1,"I googled gift ideas for a 5 year old boy for my son's birthday and this is on a list I found.  I went ahead and ordered it because it was a great price and free shipping.  Yesterday was my son's birthday and with everything he recieved - and there was a lot - this was his absolute favorite item.  The rocket goes straight up and it really gets some distance.  The harder you step on the launcher, the further it goes.  Not just the kids either, the adults were having a blast with it as well.  It seems very sturdy and I imagine I will need to buy replacement rockets since what comes up, must go down, and hits cement.  I love that it takes no batteries - one of the few things he owns that doesn't!I am buying another one today for my little neighbor who is turning 3 - he couldn't get the rocket as high as my son, but he was really enjoying it too!"
0,1,"When we have children over at our house to play with my children, it doesn't matter if the kids are 13, 3 or in between they all love these stomp rockets. I originally bought one of these to use with my 2 year old, so I could help encourage her to learn to jump. It worked almost instantly. As soon as my husband and I showed her how to use it, she was starting to jump. This is an expensive toy that is used weekly, if not daily at our house. My 2 year old quickly picked up on how to put the rockets on the stick by herself too.We actually haven't tried it in the dark yet to see if it glows, but even if it didn't I would still buy this. Since my original purchase we have bought 2 more of the other size stomp rockets to give as gifts for other children. They have raved about how much they enjoyed their gift and that it too was their favorite. I would recommend buying replacement rockets, because after repeated use they have a tendency to wear down slightly and not fly as well. By far the best toy purchase we've made!"
0,1,My son enjoys this. It's great for the house or outside. It doesn't hold well on itself so we have to prop something against it nonetheless it is worth it's use. The yellow plastic things are a nuisance though.
0,1,"Designed for the younger kids, these can really fly.  As directed, best used in wide open spaces like low tide beach, open fields.  Get refills for the rockets from Amazon.  I love the laughter and joy  launch ing these rockets with human power only."
0,1,"It's hard to avoid trees where I live, so we lost almost all of the rockets in our fun hour of play."
0,1,"i got two of these for a twin boys bday present and they just love it !! Talk about fun, the box had great ideas how teachers are using these in classrooms to teach about speed, distance etc. what a great and fun way to learn"
0,1,our 2 year old isn't quit strong enough to do it on his own but with a little help he loves this toy. he loves to watch the rockets and go get them and we help him set them off. really fun toy for the family.
0,1,"This was a Christmas present and it was by far the most fun of all of them. The kids and the adults loved it. It's durable, simple and surprisingly capable. Use it in a clear area unless you want to climb trees and roofs to retrieve the soft rockets. Whoever thought this up is a genius. Only downside is the somewhat flimsy plastic stand. I had to zip tie it together or it would fall apart if someone manhandled it. I will buy the non-junior version soon it's that good."
0,1,"These are smaller than the picture might make it seem. However, they are great quality and have held up to lots of banging and music making over the years. Although my children have outgrown them, I am hanging on to this set of musical instruments because other kids come over to play and it's always a big hit.Enjoy."
0,1,"My grandchildren have had fun with these instruments to use as we sing songs together in the mornings before our homeschooling begins. These instruments are small, and are only suitable for 3-8 year olds. They seem sturdy enough, but older children would expect larger instruments with higher quality musical sounds."
1,0,Cute set. Does not take wear & tear well. My little boy broke parts minutes after taking it from the box. Inexpensive for what you get.
0,1,"This set is a good one.  All of the little instruments sound good, hold up to abuse well.  I'd buy it again."
0,1,This is junk. Nothing that would last.  We returned it since the quality is so poor. It was cute but wouldn't have lasted for more than a couple days.
1,0,"Everyone who comes in the house seems to be drawn to this trumpet.  It is realistic looking and plays real songs fairly easily.  It is light weight and visually appealing.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is that it is a little difficult to blow.  You have to blow fairly hard in order to produce a sound.  I bought it for my 3 year old and he can play it, but the older kids have had more fun with it.  I would definitely recommend it."
0,1,"Every storytime puppet collection needs a good villain or two, and this shark fills the role perfectly.  It's just scary enough to give the kiddos a bit of a thrill, but still pretty soft and squishy so they can also give it a good snuggle.  The size is great for groups, and even though the fit is a bit snug for my hand, it has not presented any problems in slipping it on and off quickly. I haven't had this puppet for very long, but he's proven to be very popular with the storytime crowd as he comes swimming out of my puppet box.  He has survived lots of little hands so far, and I look forward to using him for years to come."
1,0,This is a wonderful toy that will last for years!  It is made of wood and all pieces are of wood also!
0,1,"My husband and I purchased this game as a birthday gift for my 7-year-old daughter.  She loves board games, and we spend a lot of family time playing games like Sorry and Trouble, which are fun, but they're also on the rather flimsy side, and don't always hold up well to heavy use by children.  I fell in love with this game almost from the word go--and so did my daughter.  Even the box is heavyweight and gorgeous, unlike the typical flimsy boxes that contain her other games.  The board is heavier duty than the mass-produced games we typically play, and the treasure cards are sturdy, thick, and guaranteed to hold up far, far better than, say, her deck of Uno cards.  The little trees are pretty sturdy plastic, but the tokens and the dice are made of wood.  Have I died and gone to gaming heaven, where games seem lovingly, carefully made instead of mass-produced and cheap?The gameplay itself is also fun and unlike any other game we've played.  It's a bit of a combination of Memory and Sorry.  At the beginning of the game, you turn over one of the treasure cards, and your object is to find that treasure and give it to the king before the other players.  Players must move around the board, peeking under the trees to see where the treasures are hidden.  Even if you don't find the one you're looking for, you want to remember what you've seen so that you know where to find it, should its card be turned up.  Once you find the hidden treasure that matches the one on the card, you head to the castle to give it to the king.  The first player to find and return three treasures wins the game.But that's only half of the game.  Finding the treasure and making it to the castle are two entirely different things.  Landing on the same place as another player sends that player back to the starting point in the village.  If you roll the same number on both dice, you have the option of using three different spells.  Because of this, the game moves beyond a simple memory game and into the realm of strategy.  If you find the treasure, do you immediately charge toward the castle, hoping the other players can't stop you, or do you attempt to throw them off your trail by pretending to continue looking?This is our first Ravensburger product, but not our first independent game.  I can safely say that this won't be our last Ravensburger game.  I'm extremely impressed with how beautifully made and how creative a game it is.  It's fun not just for my daughter, but also for me and my husband, which means we all enjoy a good family gaming session."
1,0,"We love this game - it's challenging for kids and adults alike. It's mostly a memory game, but it also combines a minimal strategic approach. It is a great transitional game to harder strategy based games, like Settlers of Catan. My 4-year old can beat me, like truly beat me - not even with me giving him a break! It's a lot of fun - definitely recommend."
0,1,We got this for my daughter for her 5th birthday and she loves it.  She wants to play this more than any of our other numerous games.  I is great for memory and great for teaching stradegy
0,1,"It really is an Enchanting little game. There are pine trees scattered in the forrest and under the pine trees are pictures of treasures . It can be a key or a slipper, etc. You have a stack of cards , you flip over the first card and it shows the picture of the treasure you need to find first. You roll the die and make your way around the forrest trying to land on a spot where a pine is so that you can ""peek"" and see if the treasure is under that pine. If you find the treasure under that pine do not tell anyone, just hurry on over to the castle and tell the king. If you guess correctly you keep that card and continue looking for treasures. These are the basic rules although there are more fun add-ons to these rules. The game is nicely made and tons of fun. I would definitely recommend this one !!"
0,1,"This is one of three Ravensurger products that we bought in a short time. First was Labyrinth, and is by far our absolute favorite family game. My husband, 9 year old and 7 year old love all them. This game is right behind Labyrinth. It takes a memory and strategy. A must have family game."
1,0,"The entire family enjoys this game (mom, dad, and 2 daughter, age 13 and 6), and it is great to have a game our younger 6-yr-old can play.  The game relies on some strategy and a lot of memory (remembering where things are hidden).  There are 20 or so evergreen trees with magic objects hidden beneath them and corresponding cards.  The cards are shuffled and turned over one by one; the order of the cards determines the order in which the magic objects must be revealed.  Players travel around the board searching for specific magic objects, peeking under each tree.  The game requires that a player remember which object is hidden under each tree (and it changes every game, so it is different each time).  When they find the object indicated by the card that is face up, they can race to the castle to reveal that magic object and claim it.  The first player to collect 3 magic objects wins.  So the game involves some luck (if you happen to have peeked under the right tree that has the object indicated by the card), some strategy (what order you choose to move around the board) and a lot of memory (remembering which object is under which tree so that when the corresponding card is turned face up, you can be the first to get to the castle and reveal where the object is hidden).  If you get to the castle but then forget which tree hides the object (e.g. name the wrong tree), you have to go back to &#34;Start.&#34;  My 6-yr-old has good memory, but 20 trees/hidden objects is a lot for her, so we would give her two chances to reveal the hiding place to make it more fair for her (though she often didn't need the extra chance).  We have had a lot of fun with this game."
1,0,"The good King is looking for someone to take over the Throne as he has no children.  He has decided to ask people to locate magic treasure to prove their worth.The board is made up of twisting and branching paths that lead from the village, through the forest, and into the castle.  Cards are used to determine what the King is looking for.  The card has a scene from a popular fairy tale and a picture of the desired object.  Players move their pieces through the forest looking for trees.  Each of the tree pieces has a treasure hidden under it.  Players landing on a tree get to secretly look at the treasure.  Once they know where the desired treasure is, they can head to the castle to tell the King.  The first player to successfully find three desired treasures wins the game.Magic can also be used in the game.  On certain rolls of the dice, players can teleport to any tree of their choosing, go to the castle gate, or randomly change the desired treasure card.  Movement is a little different than in most games.  Two dice are used but they are not added.  For instance, a roll of a 5 and a 4 can get you nine spaces along but it can also get you five spaces in one direction and four in another.  In this way a 4 and a 5 can be used to move one space.  Thus subtraction skills become as important as addition skills.  While my two kids love the game (ages four and seven) it has elements that make it palatable to the adult as well.  Check it out."
0,1,"We love love love this game!! My sons 6 & 8 have really enjoyed this game. Even daddy and I like paying it! It keeps us all entertained for a good 45 minutes. We sometimes don't use all of the trees and cards if we want a shorter game time. It really helps to build memory and strategy techniques for children. I would give this game as a gift, it's so well made and just different from all the more popular easy to find games out there."
0,1,"This is definitely a game that my daughter will grow in to. She's just a little more than 4, so we have modified this game to be more cooperative and yield faster rewards, and it is our absolute favorite.For parents of 4-5's who might be interested, we have made the following modifications:* We play 2 at a time and it's mainly cooperative with some competition thrown in (mostly hooting, hollering, racing) with a much faster tempo (game done in 20 mins).* Our rules are a blend of Junior Labyrinth, Memory, Sorry, and I Spy (other games that she loves and plays well on her own without help).* Child wants to win but needs help with strategy at times.The modifications:1. We move as instructed with the dice. Doubles get you to a tree or straight to the key (to cut down on some of the hassle of landing on the key, which can drag on and on).2. When you land on a tree, you show everyone the treasure that you found (like Memory). Both of us work together to pattern the trees into our memory, and we work as a team to get to and identify the different tree-treasures.3. Then we basically are racing to the key via doubles or dice rolls to try to claim whatever treasure card is showing and helping each other either remember or try to figure out which of the ""unseen"" treasures it might be.4. Whoever gets to the key gets to try to remember where the treasure card was (we help each other).5. If you win the card, you take both the card and the tree for your ""treasure area"" (again, like Memory or I Spy) and go back to the village to ""start again."" Of course, if you roll a double on your next turn, you can choose to go to either a tree or right back to the key to claim your next treasure.6. The person with the with the most treasures at the end wins (like Memory or I Spy). She usually beats me by 2 cards, and has a wonderful time doing it.We did play a ""real"" game tonight and the first card really stumped everyone, so folks had seen all the trees, then forgotten them, because we forgot that a double could change the treasure card. 40 minutes in, only I had 2 cards, Dad had been sent back to the village, daughter was dancing around the room. Went back to modified play and she had a great time playing 2 more rounds.There are a number of things that I love about this game:1. As described above, this game has loads of potential so it can be modified to be faster/more cooperative/easier for kids all the way down to 4 years of age.2. It's Ravensburger, which means that you are getting really excellent quality game, with nice pieces, a beautiful playing board, strategy, etc. I can see this game lasting a really long time.3. She is going to grow into it over time--as opposed to growing out of it over time. Many ""kid"" games are for such a narrow age range, say 5-7 years, and I find that the 4 & 5 year olds memorize the plays really quickly and a lot of the games can become boring or just too easy. (I Spy, while loads of fun, is enjoying a retirement for this reason, until everyone ""forgets"" the memorized game cards; Operation is just too one-dimensional.Super game, thrilled."
0,1,"This is a very good game. We've been playing it over the weekend, and it is everything other reviewers write - it's a strategy game, it's memory developing, it's engaging and it's very well made.However, it rarely takes less then one hour from beginning to end, and it's not very dynamic - not much happens in the beginning, so it's kind of drags for a while. I noticed, that the game was of more interest for the kids nine and over. Younger kids just don't have enough patience, interest and stamina to go through all game.I definitely recommend the game - but for kids older than nine."
0,1,Great fun and encourages interaction. This is a beautiful toy for growing and learning. Great addition to our collection. Gets kids moving and laughing and investigating new ways to make things move.
0,1,"We got this when my daughter was about 14 months old.  She loves it and needed help at first, but now that she is 22 months she is all over it and does everything by herself and then some.  I can see that all the climbing she did on this put her ahead of most kids her age in that respect, but that can make some things more challenging for us parents too like when they try the skill inside and climb the bookcase (lol).  Kids in our neighborhood from 1 to 8 love this and it gets a lot of use.  Between this, the Little Tikes dinosaur sandbox, and the water slide pool (INTEX) our house looked like Toddler Disneyland this summer."
0,1,"We got this for our 2 and 3 year old and loved it from the start. The only problem is getting the playground together. It takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to assemble it. Then if a side pops out, it takes a while to get it back in without another side coming out as well. Prepare to need two people to move it (so the grass underneath doesn't die or just to place in a different area) because it will pop apart that way too. You deal with this same problem when rearranging it also. However, it is very durable and great at keeping the fun going since it can be assembled 8 different ways. We really do like this play equipment and will get many years of use from it. I just wish it wouldn't come apart so much."
0,1,"I purchased this swing to replace the blue Little Tikes swing.  The blue swing had a higher back, and was really more for a small infant, that couldn't hold their head up well.  This swing is more for a bigger child/toddler.  The only complaint I have is that it is hard to get your child out, if you are standing in front of them.  It is MUCH easier to get them out from the back."
0,1,"I bought this game for my almost 3 yr old son for xmas and he loves it! It's developmentally on target for his age, he has been imagining monsters at home and this game really helped him deal with that fear appropriately. And it is fun to play! As a mom and child therapist, this game is highly recommended!"
1,0,"Our son is coming up on 2 years, 2 months. I took a chance on this very simple game, not really sure whether it would be readily playable, or destined for the shelf for a few months. It's been a bit of a mixed bag, but overall my wife an I would say it's been successful.The game is very much like a simple wood cut-out puzzle (hmm... idea for a premium version?) in that there are four ""empty"" spaces on the game board with the outline of a bed, lamp, picture and teddy bear. Our son readily understood this aspect of the game.The eight monster pieces obviously don't belong with the bedroom pieces, and once we all began chanting ""GO AWAY MONSTER"" and tossing the piece into the pile when drawn, our son caught on and readily joined in the ceremony.We don't have a successful completion every time -- sometimes his attention wanders, or he just wants to toss the game pieces around -- but that's OK. There's still a learning opportunity to be had just in setting up the game, sorting the pieces, counting the number of players and required number of game pieces, etc.Perhaps the most successful aspect of this game has been the game case itself. When we first opened it, our son said ""Suitcase!"" and has since been toting the box just about everywhere. The box, like the game pieces, has proved to be durable and immune to gentle trashing and sticky fingers."
0,1,"The reviews were spot on.  Not only do you get a little idea what horse shows are like there is a great deal of strategy in choosing you team for each show.  I can tell because my 9 year old kicks my heiney most of the time and I dont know how.It is a little difficult only at first but once you get in the groove of being the dealer that show, choosing your five cards and putting down your horse for each event, your hooked.Really cool addition to my card game collection"
0,1,"I bought this for my son's 9th birthday.  The rules, at first, seemed confusing but as we played they became more clear.  Before we knew it we were Frogjuice addicts.  The game takes 15-20 minutes max with three people.  We found we kept playing it over and over again and one day played 3 hours straight with our son.  He couldn't be happier becasue we are playing together, and we couldn't be happier because the game is fun and is an excellent mix of luck and strategy.  It also takes some basic math skills, which is a bonus.  I highly recommend this game."
0,1,"I bought two of these Eight balls before I read any reviews, and I was apprehensive when they arrived because by then I had read all the comments saying that they do not work, that the answers do not display because the cube thingy is stuck on a side or that the liquid is too dark.  The first day I could not get it to read right and I was discouraged, but then my 4 year old son wanted to see how it worked and I showed him, and voila, it worked.  I figured out that it has to do with how you shake it.  It is a gentle backwards-forwards shake with the lense away from you.  Everytime now, it shows an answer, clearly. If I shake it up and down, it doesn't work.  I tried it with both, and they both work.  Everytime.  Apparently I will win the Lottery, but the date is not clear as yet!"
0,1,We had so much fun with this at Christmas that I am purchasing another for the office.  So much fun!
0,1,"I think the liquid is a little too thick and dark, and therefore kind of hard to tilt it just right to read the response.  I wouldn't buy this again."
0,1,I remember having the magic 8 ball when I was a kid and it has the same magic for my 6 yr old daughter that it did when I was her age.  One of those classic toys...  :)
0,1,The box says assembly required. This should be noted in advertising. Kids that want to help can make a mess. There needs to be a no assembly model. Fun and learning not extra stress please.
1,0,This is not sold anywhere but Amazon!!  I am so excited to play this with my 4 year old daughter.  I bought this as a Christmas gift for her for this year.  Just the fact that it is purple will make her one happy little girl.
0,1,I am a speech pathologist in the schools and use this game during therapy.  The kids love to play it but it is a lot of work to set up and some of the younger kids have trouble putting int he sticks.  I usually have to set up the game for the students.
0,1,"I didn't have any problems with the pieces snapping together, but was disappointed when the sticks would slip out.  You can't put big angles in the sticks until you get quite a few pieces already in that are flat.  Otherwise they will slip out, and cause frustration.  It's also very loose fitting to the base and flops around.  It also takes about 5 minutes to set the game up between rounds.It's an OK game though for play, each game lasts at most a few minutes, and in my experience someone is going to ""lose"" very quickly, that is, you'll take out a stick and 20 marbles will fall.It's fun for about 20 minutes, just don't expect hours of play out of this one."
0,1,Started playing this game with granny and papa on our annual Padre Island trips.  Kids can't get enough of it.
0,1,We love UNO and thought we would like this too.  Nope.  It hasn't caught on.  Too complicated and just not fun for the whole family.
0,1,"I am SO glad we decided to splurge on this ball tent set!  We could not get our toddler to crawl through a long tunnel we already had; so I was not sure this would be a good buy, but we took that chance.  He LOVES it and plays in it every day.  He runs in to get to the balls.  I have even climbed in there with him, but there's not much room to move for an adult!  It takes up a lot of space, but I like that we can just set up the basketball/ball tent or any tent on its own when space is limited. The basketball hoop is a VERY fun addition.  I love tossing the balls in there easily to show my little one how. What a great buy!"
0,1,"We got this item for our 9 month old son.  He absolutely loves the ball pit; however, you will want more than 50 balls.  The whole family can have fun, even our dog loves to race through the tunnels."
0,1,"The N64 was Nintendo's 3rd console (not counting the Game Boy, and Virtaul Boy).It came out shortly after the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation. If you don't have this system anymore or never have. And collect systems and and games, then I recommend this system. The controller has always at first glace seemed like a gimmick. And like myself, probably made you think how are people supposed to use that controller. But it actually isn't too bad! The system it's self is pretty simple, yet cool looking. And is for the most part really reliable. And having 4 controller ports is a plus too! Though it would have been nice if Nintendo released more mature games for the console, there are some classic games. I recommend the games below.007 Golden EyeMortal Kombat TrilogyMario Kart 64WCW NWO RevengeResident Evil 2Super Mario 64F-ZeroReady 2 RumbleLegend Of Zelda Ocarina Of TimeStar Wars Shadows Of The EmpireNBA HangtimeDOOM 64NFL BlitzKiller Instinct GoldBio Freaksand WAYNE Gretzky's 3D Hockey to name a few to start with."
0,1,"In a time where the Internet is being seen by several people, and consoles try to take advantage of it, and those consoles would run on CDs, the Nintendo 64 had arrived into the scene. It didn't run on CDs, but cartridges. It had no online support whatsoever. But you know what? It sold well.Nintendo had, once again, revolutionized the gaming industry with their move of making the Nintendo 64. How? Because of Super Mario 64, one of the first games for the system.Having 4 players instead of 2 add up to the fun that you would probably have when playing games like Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Mario Party, and Goldeneye 007."
1,0,"I have 4 sons who spent many hours playing on this little baby.  For a long time it was the best system out there.  The games were so good that we held on to the machine and couldn't part with it. It gathered dust for several years until my son in college rediscovered it in a closet at home during a Thanksgiving visit.  He asked if he could take it to college with him, so it's now being actively used again!  He's an Animation major and absolutely loves the games and memories.The price is certainly better than the newer systems and games for some ""old school"" fun."
1,0,I would recommend this umbrella highly if you want to provide shade while your toddler is in the radio flyer.  Great accompanying item.
1,0,"not that functional. I thought this would be perfect, but it needs to constantly be adjusted to keep your little one in the shade"
1,0,"I bought this when my son was a baby. He absolutely loved it! It's a great baby toy and a classic too. After age 1 he lost interest in it though but seeing him smile was worth it. By the way, save your money and go to a local store and buy this. It's like over half the cost!"
0,1,pretty good quality and holds air great even after kids jump around on it. I will have to see how it does in the water on our upcoming trips
0,1,"My grandchildren, ages 6, 8 and 10 have had a blast with this alligator in our backyard pool.  I never thought it would be such a hit, but they take &#34;Allie&#34; to the pool everytime they come to swim."
0,1,"My three-year-old really loves this pool, and even though we used it most of the summer, we never had any problems with tears or leaks.  We will be pulling it out again next summer!"
1,0,My two and half year old loves this wagon.  He loves to open the little door and gets in and out with any trouble.  The little storage bin can hold his cup and snack while we walk to the park.  Even in this cold weather he loves riding in it.  And it was super easy to put it together.  I hate waiting for my husband to come home and put things together!!
0,1,"We bought this wagon a couple years ago for our then 2 year old twin boys and our infant daughter to use.  It's a great wagon, but the door has never shut properly.  The kids (boys now 4, and Aubrey 2)love it, but they know when they get in it to move to the other side so mommy can try to ""slam"" the door shut.  Sad to say that is the only way it will shut, and I always try to keep it closed to keep the kids safe.  Ours did not come with seatbelts like the newer ones.  Nonetheless, it's still a great wagon, and my kids fight over who gets to sit in the seats.  Maybe we have to get the trailer--hmmmm......Heidi Olson"
0,1,"Just like the title of the toy says ""My 1st Rc Go Go School Bus"" this should be considered a toy that is intended for someone that hasn't used a remote controlled car before. It only goes forward and clockwise for turning. My daughter loves it. Only has the one button for steering on the control, so it's not overly complicated. The on/off switch is under the bus. Just make sure to turn it off when not in use. Ours will randomly make noises or move by itself when it's left on and no one has the remote. This actually freaked me out one night when I couldn't figure out what was making the noise! However, now I always remind my daughter to turn it off when she's done playing."
1,0,"We bought this for our little grandson.  He has figured it out and can manage to control it, and he is only 2 1/2 yo.  My husband had a blast testing it out as did our son.  Our other grandson who is 4 yo also loved playing with this.  Good value for price."
0,1,Purchased two of these and my girls just love this Stable Set.
0,1,"I would consider myself a very lenient judge of toys. I've never complained when doors fall off, wings fall out, or windows & gates have to be resnapped again & again. I don't mind that- but what I do mind is buying my daughters 6 Breyer horses & stable set for her 6th birthday and within only 1 week 4 of the 6 are completely broken.... including the white horse that came with the Glamour Girls' ranch too. My girls are gentle with their toys and were ready for some ""Real looking Horses."" So, I bought Breyer horses and as my husband says, ""Never again."" 3 of the horses legs broke simply from walking them on the carpet! One of the Rider's legs snapped off just from being placed on the horse & I can't for the life of me get it back on. One of the larger horses lost all it's tail hair simply from being brushed with the brush it came with. Honestly, these toys are cheap and defective. One of the other Brands of Horses she received held up great. Now, I'm on the lookout for any more horses from any brand but Breyer. I wish I had been warned about Breyer's Quality."
1,0,"This is a very well made toy that is truly a complete set.  It is beautifully designed and constructed. Not a single broken piece on our barn or horses after almost a year of play! You don't need to buy anything extra if you don't want to - you get plenty included with this set.  This is the quality of toy you rarely see anymore. My one caveat is that the barn does sometimes fall apart, but 3 minutes and a few dabs of glue will solve that!"
0,1,I loved playing with horses as a child and can now enjoy again with my Grand Daughter.  Creative fun with this set and good value.  Arrived on time.
0,1,I can't seem to get the battery casing undone from under the truck unit. I have to send it back. I turned the screw 50 times to the left and it won't come off.
0,1,"I got one of these for our sons birthday and he loved it. OK so it's not one of the best available but I found it was good value for money. I think it is worth a try, but just don't expect too much. For a 1st truck it is OK."
0,1,The child has to be very close to the truck with the remote in order for it to go. My 20 month old got frustrated with it quickly and now plays with it without the remote. It is soft and won't damage walls.
0,1,"Each book comes with a cartridge which needs to be plugged in so that the system knows what to do when you point to different places on different pages.  It is really cool and kids love it and learn from it.  But if the cartridge gets lost, you can never use that book again.  There should be a strong string connecting the book to the cartridge so that this does not happen."
0,1,"My five year old daughter just loves her LeapPad Learning System and has used it several times a week for almost a year. The only thing I can think of that I don't like is that the system takes a cartridge and sometimes the books and cartridges get seperated and therefore the book cannot be used until the cartridge is found again. My daughter has several of the books that we purchased on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and ToysRUs. I would recommend also getting the LeapPad backpack to keep all the books, cartridges, and the system in one place. The whole family gets around the system and plays the Geography games and finds the skeletal bones. Both of those games are included with the sample book included in the box. We also use rechargeable batteries which seems to not be much of a problem as they do last quite a while. Although we have the Phonics books, the system has still not taught her to read but I have known kids who have learned to read with this system. She just really enjoys playing with it and playing the games."
1,0,I was a bit unsure about getting this toy for my 4 year old.  He hadn't asked for it as a birthday gift but it just looked so educational to me I couldn't resist.  (This has back fired on me in the past with my older son) Well it was a hit!  He just loves it.  The original book that came with it was just a sampler (still fun for him to play with) so I was glad I got the Scooby Disappearing Donuts.  He played with them all day!.  I even went out and bought another book after his birthday.  My older son is not as interested in the pad (as usual) but he does sometimes stop to play with it.The backpack is also a good choice because it gives him a safe place to keep the books and cartridges along with the LeapPad. Not to mention it's a backpack and he can pretend he is going to school.  It seems to be well made and easy for my 4 year old to use all by himself with out my having to worry he is going to break it.Christmas stockings will be filled with new books this year.
0,1,"My dau got this for her 3rd b-day. She loves books & often ""reads "" them to her 1 yr old brother since she knows the story. The problem with the Leap Pad was that unless you click a certain spot the book reads the wrong page & instead of reinforcing learning it is actually teaching incorrect words & phrases. I was very dissappointed since this is not an inexpensive toy, esp when you buy several books, the backpack, etc.. It also eats batteries. If I had it to do over again, I would not have bought this toy. I gave it high educational value since it could have been a great toy to learn with."
0,1,"I bought this as my other capital letter puzzle had become too easy for my two year old.  Melissa and Doug make great products, and we have many of them.  I expected this one to be just as great.  It was nice enough but the letter wells are not as deep as they should, so the letters fall out easier. Also the wood backing isn't as thick as other puzzles.  I will still use this, but he'll need to be older, more like Kindergarten level.  But if you want a fantastic puzzle, get the M&D clock puzzle, it's very solid and is great.  All in all, don't let this dissuade you from M&D products, in general, they are the BEST!"
1,0,"As cool as I thought this puzzle was, it isn't. The holes for the letters are very shallow, and they fall out if barely even bumped. And, the actual letters themselves aren't very defined, like the ""m"" and ""w"". Those two are tricky enough for a toddler, and this puzzle doesn't make it any easier. I would go for another puzzle."
0,1,"This puzzle is excellent quality!!  The price was a little high, I thought, until I got it.  It is really thick and sturdy.  The knobs are large and easy to grip.  I bought it for my 21 month old twin daughters.  It is extremely educational because it has different colors, shapes, and pictures underneath.  I don't find the pictures too educational, but the colors and shapes are.  There are the regular shapes (circle, square, triangle), but there is also a pentagon, an octagon, an oval and a rectangle.  These are shapes not often encountered in kid's toys.  My girls can name all the shapes, except the octagon and pentagon, which they can get close on.  This is a great puzzle and will last and last and last!"
0,1,I bought this for my 13 month old son. He is a premmie and is behind in his congitive and motor skills. He abosultely adores it. The large nobs are very easy for small hands to grasp. This is a very thick puzzle thicker then most wood puzzles I've seen. The large thick shapes make it easy for yound children to slide the pieces into places. Within 2 days of getting this he could put one of the pieces back in. And now a month later he can do them all and match the shapes up. It is wonderful we are so pleased with this item.
0,1,Pieces are large and well made. We have had the puzzle for over about 2 years now. It was one of the first my little boy could do by himself at about age 3-4. This is due to the large pieces and the fact it only has 24. Two years later he still likes to put it together those days he is into puzzles. Nice puzzle for the price.
0,1,"My son just turned 2 and the only thing he loves more than construction equipment is jigsaw puzzles. So we bought him this one, and I don't know who looked more stunned when he opened it -- him or me. It is really huge, so be advised that it's 2 ft by 3 ft, and plan accordingly. I wouldn't recommend it for those who are short on floor space, because it's not the kind of puzzle you can do on a table.Once my son got over his shock, he seemed to have fun with the puzzle. But it's hard for him to reach across the expanse of the puzzle with his little arms; he ends up having to get up and walk around the puzzle to put some of the giant pieces in place. He's just at the right age to start doing 24-piece puzzles, but maybe he's just too little for something that's scaled so big."
1,0,"As with all cardboard puzzles by Lights, Camera, Interaction! the quality is outstanding. The cardboard is thick and durable. The illustration is well-printed and the pieces are glossy. If not abused this puzzle will last generations. The pieces are strong enough not to get worn when our 2 year old tries to fit two pieces together that truly don't fit together!The subject matter of dinosaurs is much appreciated. The scene is illustrated in detail. My 2 year old and my 5 year old love this puzzle.A great gift for a birthday, for a 3, 4, or 5 year old."
0,1,"It's a great large sized puzzle, however the detail seems a little fuzzy or rasterized. Like the photo was too small and they stretched it to fit. Fun to put together though."
0,1,"I was very disappointed when I tried to buy this puzzle for my 2 1/2 year old for Christmas because it was sold out everywhere I looked.  Lucky for us Grandma came through and found one.  Am I glad she did!My son is a HUGE train fan, and this puzzle is not only fun for him to play with, but he's learning his ABC's and doesn't even know it.  The puzzle pieces are fantastic--very large and easy for little hands to manipulate.  The pictures are very clear and recognizable.  He will sit and play with it for 20 minutes at a time, which any mother of an active 2 1/2 year old will tell you is amazing!I highly recommend this toy, not only for its durability, but for its educational value.  I recommend all the toys the company ""Melissa & Doug"" manufacture.  We are thrilled with all of the ones we have either purchased or received as gifts."
0,1,This puzzle is great for explaining the letter sequence of the alphabet.  My son loves the fact its a train and takes up half the room (I think its about 10 feet long?)
0,1,"My [...] really likes this train puzzle. He knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it. It goes straight across and is over 10 feet long. There is also a picture with each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words beginning with that letter. He will say ""Q quail"" or ""N nut"" when he is putting the piece on. The pieces are easy to attach, thick and very sturdy. The pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping the picture off. This would make a really nice gift for a 2-4 year old. The box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in."
0,1,"Looking forward to filling this perfect puzzle case with peg puzzles for my son.  As noted by other purchasers, chunky puzzles and odd shaped puzzles don't fit the case.  It would be lovely if Melissa & Doug would design a case intended for those puzzles as well.  I know I'd buy it!"
1,0,"I got this when my son was a month old and he has loved it from the moment I turned it on... he's now 5 months old &amp; has figured out that his actions are what causes it to light up and make music for him. It is fun, durable, and not too bad on battery use. It even made it in a duffle bag on a flight to LA and back without any problems. Every morning he plays with it for at least a good half hour, quiet as a mouse, while I take my shower and get ready for the day."
1,0,"This is a fun game to play with both family and friends.  The wide variety of questions can provoke both great discussions and laughter!  The more players the better since it makes it more challenging to figure out who said what.Overall, a fun game (just don't let the answers turn too political!)."
1,0,"My sister was given one of these on her second birthday, she is now 12, and it was given to my daughter.  The sandboxstll looks new.  The plastic has not faded, cracked or warped.  It has been left outside for years.  The lid fits it perfectly, and no water leaks into the sand.  The children can stand on the lid without any problems.  Also it is easy to clean, at the end of the summer, we use soft scrub on it and put it in storage until the next year.  Your kids will love this!"
0,1,My almost two year old loves this! It would have been great when she was 1 too.  I think it's big enough for her to use for years to come.  It's almost october so now we cant find any sand.  Found a great deal on amazon.com
0,1,"When I was a kid we use to play a game called Touring. My guess it was a rival company but it was certainly the same game as Mille Bornes as far as I can recall. Touring hasn't been around for years now but Mille Bornes has continued and this collectors addition should make Baby Boomers and even kids today happy on a rainy day or any time you feel like playing a card game. Anyone that enjoys games with some challenge and luck should enjoy it. The object is to get all your speed cards before your opponents. There are flat tire, run out of gas, speed limit, and wreck cards you use to road block your opponents. Just great fun to play for the whole family. I guarantee if you get them to sit down and play just one hand it will end up being a few hours before you quit. You can set it up and learn the rules quickly and play a few hands for just minutes if you like or spend hours at it to kill time or pass a bad weather day. Excellent family entertainment. This is a real plus to take on trips with the friends or family to kill a little time with when resting or if the rain has dampened your plans for the day. If I have any complaints, it is the newest versions are cheaply made in comparison to the original version. I would rather pay a little more than have such cheaply made cards. As one reviewer astutely put it they use to be like Bicycle brand cards. They use to be nice and thick with a good plastic coating. Now they are like notebook paper with a little wax on them. If you are lucky enough to find a older version at a garage sale or somewhere I recommend it over this one. I probably should have taken off two stars for Durability but I like the game itself so much I wasn't thinking clearly."
0,1,"This game is just right for my daughter who will soon be six. She likes playing it, and she is pretty good in asking questions and getting to the right answer. It's fun for older kids, too.I did not have any problem with the game field being two parts - since we always play on table, not carpet. I would not say that it's too small and the pictures are minuscular - they are rather comfortable size, we don't need to strain the eyes playing it.It's a fun and enjoyable game."
0,1,I think this is OK.  It looks like more fun then it actually is.  my kids get excited to use it and then after about 30 seconds they have moved on.  It is not easy to stay on and bounce.  i have a daycare and over think it is a waste of money.
0,1,This hopper has become a favored toy with the little one. It is the perfect size for her as a large four year old.
0,1,My son doesn't use it much but he has and enjoyed it.  Holding up well - have had it for 6 months now
0,1,"I bought one a few years back for my (then) 2-year old boy, and he has been bouncing on it since... For some time, my now 4-year old and his 2-year old brother were taking turns.Well, hurray! Amazon has them in stock again - and for ten bucks this is great! The fighting over the old one ended (just those fights though - bummer) and now we have two bouncing buggers hopping around the house on their blue thingamajigs (thank you Amazon for having the same color in stock, otherwise...)Some of the reviews complained about the size being too small. Unless they have giant kids (mine are in the 90th percentile for height) I don't see how that's an issue... Also, we have never had to inflate the old one in over 2 years now!Oh, the now 2-year old ball is a little larger from all that abuse - so some of the arguing still continues over who gets the new (little smaller) ball. Well, it never ends..."
0,1,"I really didn't like this toy.  It is nonfunctioning as both a walking toy and a riding one.  As a walker, there isn't enough room for a child's feet when they are walking with it in front of them.  As a rider and walker, it doesn't roll very well.  I just didn't like this at all.  It also doesn't have as many activities on it as many other walking and riding toys.  I would not recommend anyone buy this."
1,0,"My son could not use it as walking thing, because it wasn't steady, and I can't imagine how other parents let there babies walk with it. But from the other side - as car he adores it, and keeps playing with it all the time, it's his favorite car. But I hoped that we could use it from both side, that's why I have mixed feelings."
0,1,"We got this for my son at about 10 months since he wasn't crawling.  We thought he would enjoy moving around.  At first he could only push backwards from sitting, but he caught on. His favorite part was the trunk.  Every mornig we would hide something new in it an encourage him to look.  Eventually, he would head straight for the car when he got out of bed! :-) I think the seat is too wide, and my son was tall, so he had to lean over in walker-mode.  Overall, it's not very interesting or ""educational"".  I'd probably get one that is more of an activity walker since that's really what he would use: a walker and table-like activities... the ""car"" is just for Mom and Dad's enjoyment."
0,1,"We bought this toy for our son's first birthday, as he was starting to cruise around the furniture. He did have a little trouble tripping on the base at first, but he was new to walking, so I think he would have tripped a little on anything. As a car, he's just now at 18 months starting to figure it out. At first, he would always get on backwards, and then he was uncomfortable because of the handlebar. Plus, he always scoots on it backward. He's just now getting the concept of pushing off with his toes, and going forward. He liked it anyways, backward or forward, so it doesn't really matter to me which way he goes. Also, he loves to store little toys in the trunk, as well as the remote for our tv, which is quite small. Many times when the remote is missing, we have to ask him for it, and he retrieves it from his trunk. We have not had any problems with it at all, and our son is a little rough with his toys. Some people have mentioned it being hard to change from the walker to the car, but we've found that it's only hard if you try to force it in. If you pull the release lever back until you get it into the notch, then it will lock great when you release the lever. This is a great multi-functional toy that I am sure he will use for a long time to come, unlike his other walker which he is no longer interested in now that he can walk without it."
1,0,"My daughter was about 13 months old when we were given the Walk N Ride.  She absolutely has loved it ever since (she's now 20 months old).  She still uses it as a push toy, putting her blankies/stuffed animals on the handlebar and carting them around.She is short for her age (most people mistake her for a 13 month old now!) and she is still too tall to use it as a riding toy.  She recently played with her cousin's John Deere 4 wheeler toy (LOVED IT!) and has been trying to use her Walk N Ride in the same way, but the seat just sits too low.  I cannot imagine a 3 year old being able to use it as a riding toy like the upper end of the manufacturer's age recommendation suggests.  She still likes to try and will sit on it and scoot herself backwards since that's a lot easier due to the size.  She is able to scoot herself forward, but not very well.  We end up pushing her ourselves and she loves that.  The red flap that opens to a storage area can hold a couple small toys, but can only really be used when it's set as a rider.  Since we don't use it that way a lot, I wish the storage area was where the spinner is.  Then again, she always loved the spinner when it was a walking toy.She likes the spinner toy, likes the shifter that makes clicking noises, and likes the circle turning thing which also makes clicking noises.  The antenna type thing is a little odd, but she does grab it, bend it down, and watch it spring back up so I guess it's alright.  She also likes to put things on it (toy rings or anything that will fit over it).VERY durable.  She's tossed this thing around, plays with it EVERY SINGLE DAY, and it's held up nicely.  We've played with it outside a few times, but it doesn't move as well over our grass so we use it indoors most of the time.Very easy and fast to switch from rider to walk toy and vice versa.LOVE the colors on it (mine is the bright green one) - gender neutral, bright, and more updated to go with the times."
0,1,"I umm and aahh about spending this sort of money on a train table and playboard for my children but after doing my homework I decided this is the one I would buy.Other train tables I have seen in stores are often wonky and seem quite unstable - and this is after they've been played on in the stores. So after seeing poorer quality tables for similar prices I decided to save up for the Thomas branded one and this single sided playboard.Yes, it's expensive, but as with any ""brand"", it's the name you are paying for. If you want a Thomas collection of trains and accessories you are going to have to pay. I'm just starting our collection and am buying the ""Thomas"" trains and buildings, but found a compatible generic track for less than half the price. I was lucky enough to get this playboard at almost half price at a after Christmas sale. It's worth waiting for sales and price comparing.It's beautifully painted and when used with the table frame is extremely strong (although I wouldn't recommend standing on it).It's up to you to spend to decide if you want to spend this sort of money but I see this as something I won't ever have to replace and it's something my son can keep for his children. Toys like this will last!"
1,0,"I was going to buy thisMusic & Lights Sit 'n Spin: Rockin' Tunesfor Devon for his first birthday last January, but his mother beat me to it. He's been spinning on this for eight months and still loves it. What a treat to observe that adorable little guy playing and enjoying every minute of life. His laugh is pure joy as he spins around, his smile brightening the faces of the entire family.This toy has held up well, which says much for its durability because Devon's a pretty rough-and-tumble kid ... as boys should be, of course. ... lol ...He loves the music ... much more than his mother does, so I'm going to suggest she take the advice of another reviewer and remove the batteries.  I'm certain Devon would still have fun with this classic--music or no music.Devon recommends it highly! Mommy recommends it with reservations about the too-loud music, so I'm giving it four stars.Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008author of The Toonies Invade Silicon Valley"
0,1,My girls that are in their 30s loved their sit and spin. When did they add music. my grandson will spin and spin making me dizy but not him
1,0,"I remember enjoying these as a kid and our family had one for years.  When some gave us this one I thought it was pretty neat but WOAH is that music LOUD, there is no volumn control and while I'm not a prude and want only quiet toys, contrary, I want toys that will stimulate young minds so I don't mind noise but this thing IS LOUD!  So I put some tape over the 2 speakers (LOOKS like there are 4 but music only comes from 2) I put tape over the speakers and wah-la just the right volume now.But I read why people rated this negatively.  And I am glad, I thought it was just my imagination---but it's TRUE, this must be smaller than the original version I grew up with.  At 18 months I tried to help my daughter spin on it yet for her to sit on it her chest would rub the steering wheel.By 2 she could spin it herself but would risk a tumble with each turn as she tried to balance herself on the small base and still manuever the steering wheel.A big turnoff is portability.  To pick this up and move it you have to hold the bottom end otherwise it falls off the handle, perhaps it was meant to screw in and ours is missing a screw?Anyway, if someone wants to buy one cheap then I know where you can get one haha."
0,1,"This toy is great!! I bought it for my daughters first birthday,she and my other 3year old daughter love it. This sit and spin each other for hours a day. Since it's so close to the ground it doesn't hurt when they fall off it. The seat is kinda small but for littler kids it works fine, They both caught on quickly how to work the music, and it's not to loud. A great toy for the money."
0,1,"My husband and I were so excited to give our 18 month old a sit n spin for Christmas.  Growing up, we had both loved sit n spin!  But, when we put the toy together we were somewhat dissapointed.Is it just us, or did this toy get much smaller?  Both of us thought the sit n spin shrunk.  Also, it seemed much flimsier than I remember my blue sitnspin that I had back in the 80's.  I remember using this toy as a much older child making me think it was bigger back then.Overall this is still a great toy!!  Our toddler is just getting the hang of it, but I know he'll be spinning on it for hours someday.  I think the music is cute, and the batteries can always be removed if you don't like it.The big dissapointment is the small size  and flimsyness of the item!  Our son barely fits on it. I think it cold get alot more use by kids (and adults!!!) if it was larger."
0,1,Was ready to have more of a challenge. Fun game to play with kids. Good to be non mecganical game
1,0,"I bought this game after playing with my husband's family over Christmas. My 14-year-old niece was quite a good player and my 6-year-old son helped his aunt play. It was thoroughly addictive for all of us.PROS:It is so fun!There are many colors, which help match the number of dots (there are two  or three sizes of dots--larger for the lower numbers, smaller for the higher numbers), which can get pretty tricky.The tiles sound good when you smoosh them together to mix them up. Very click clicky.My 6-year-old loves it and even beat me a few times! (Really. I did NOT let him win.)Unlike for some of the other reviewers, our tin was not dented upon delivery. Maybe the manufacturer figured that out.CONS:The tiles chip easily.They stain easily (something got on two of the tiles--not sure if they came that way or it happened at our house, but we noticed it immediately). I tried to remove but only an SOS pad helped. Now I can still see a (very) slight discoloration.There are only four trains. As another reviewer mentioned, you can use coins for the other eight slots, but really, why only four?There is no electronic train. I assumed there would be; I should have known better. I'll look to see if I can buy it separately.My four-year-old daughter is utterly disinterested (but I'm not surprised--it's definitely too old for her).Have fun! This really is a great value."
1,0,"Rounded edges..difficult to set up trails and knock'em down...disappointed in this puchase.They r nice for the traditional game, but my kids nor I am interested."
0,1,"I was a teacher for 42  years and the last 25 years were spent teaching the Gifted and Talented.  The Rush Hour games were very popular with my students.  The game is quite easy to understand.  The children are presented with challenges of trying to drive a jeep out of the jungle after setting up the animals and other pieces in a specific pattern as designated by a card (the answers are on the back). The cards start at the beginner level and are gradually more and more difficult.,  Teaches children and adults to think logically and problem solve.  There is also a Cars Rush hour and a Train Rush Hour.  This game is excellent for students and adults of all ability levels."
0,1,"If you have ever played Rush Hour or Parking Lot on the iPhone or iPad, then you are familiar with the premises of Safari.  The game is a challenge of spatial manipulation, to get a safari rover to an exit around animals that block its path.The game comes with 40 challenges of increasing difficulty.  It comes with a sturdy 7 in x 7 in grid, 2 lions, 3 lionesses, 3 elephants, 2 zebras, 2 rhinos, 4 herds of impalas, 2 termite mounds with wild dogs, and a cloth sac to carry everything in.Like the cars in Rush Hour, the animals can only move forward and reverse.  They were less colorful than I expected, but are still attractive.You might ask, in this age of 99-cent or free iPhone apps, why should I still buy a plastic game?  I would have no hesitation buying this game today.  First, I hate the fact that kids' eyes are constrained to a tiny screen for a long period of time.  Second, we are tactile creatures, and touching the pieces may be more conducive to thinking spatially, for little ones that cannot think in abstract terms.  Third, the smart phones offer too many other distractions.  I hate the idea of playing something with the distraction of hundreds of other apps vying for attention.The challenges are very reasonable.  We played slowly and finished the challenges in several days.  Answers are provided.  I would consider it a good birthday present for someone ages 6-9."
0,1,My 6 and 8 year-olds really like this game and so do I--good brain work-out and addictive! A good game for adults and children.
0,1,"I do like this game strictly for it purpose of teaching children how to count money.  I didn't give it a five, b/c the game itself has some mildly quirky rules, which left me feeling like the person who designed it does not have real experience, knowledge or a background in education and therefore a lack of understanding of how most children can best learn to count money.  The quirky rules made it less engaging and distracting from the purpose of learning to count money."
0,1,"I purchased this game for my son when he was 5 (now 6) and he asks to play it on a daily basis! It can be played in less than 10 minutes, so we usually play a few rounds at a time. It teaches basic money math in that only the coins are used. There are $1 bills, but those only come in to play if you want to cash the change in (Bank Exchange). Basically, you move around the board and collect money for doing certain chores that you land on by rolling a die. There is a spinner and it might say that you cannot be paid with nickels (or dimes or quarters) for your chore, so you have to learn how to make the change using the different coins other than the easiest or most obvious way. If you spin ""Money Bags"", you have to give your chore money to the pot in the middle of the game board and if you land on the $ sign, you get to take the change from Money Bags. The winner is the person who finishes with the most money (generally less than $2). I really enjoy playing the game with my son and wish this game was around when I was learning about money. This is perfect for kids just learning about money, however it does not teach them how to make change (you only add the coins up so you can be paid for your chore), so I would really only recommend it for ages 4 to 6."
0,1,"My kids are little Scrooges so a game that allows them to make money to lord over their siblings ranks high on the fun list. The only thing I wish it has were more coins because we do tend to run out of pennies, especially."
0,1,we have been playing this game for awhile nowand kids love it they do not tire of it yetit is a nice fast pace which is good for kidsyou have to think about how to make the amount sometimes without certain coinsplus you can count out your coins at certain times to turn in for billsthey like that part as wellthe coins are durable nice sizedyou can use real money once kids are older mine like to do that once in awhile when we find enough changefloating around the housethe game has help up for three years so faronly thing i wish the spinner could stay attatched to the board but we do have to remove it after every gamebecause we can not close the board and close the box with spinner on the boardi like that it has good play value and learning value and they really do not realize they are learning math
0,1,"In all the years I played with my own tinker toys, and all the kids I've known who HAD tinker toys, I've never known anyone who actually ""used up"" his/her tinker toys--except my son.  I cannot keep buying these for him, or I""m gonna go broke!  I refuse to buy the plastic version.  But the wooden ones he ""spins them to death.""  He builds ""fans."" (He's autistic and obsessed with spinny things.) And the ""fans"" get spinning so fast, and for so long (like hours on end), that eventually pieces of the connector pieces will break off.  We used to glue them with wood glue, which works, but we got tired of always fixing them.  And he doesn't keep them picked up very well at all--soooo, little by little, they're getting tossed in the trash.  BUT these are great toys for apparently anyone EXCEPT my son, and even then, it wasn't because he didn't enjoy them.  He enjoyed them a little too hard."
0,1,I didn't think my 4 and 6 year old were gonna like it because it's kind of a dated toy. Wow was I wrong. It is revamped with new pieces. The basics are still there like the sticks and wheels but there are also plastic add ons and tubes and flaps...all kinds of things to make all kinds of things. Great toy!
0,1,"My son wanted a wallet of his own. At the time, this had good ratings. This could not even fit into an adults back pocket. My child enjoys throwing the plastic coins around, but other than that, it has not interested him. The wallet is poorly made, the coins are cheap, the money is flimsy paper and the id and credit card is the thinnest cardboard you could imagine. If you actually put the coins in the wallet the zipper breaks. It is ugly as well. Buy something else."
1,0,"I got two of these for my twins so they each have their own. The wallet seems well made and is filled with &#34;money&#34;. They love having their own play money. This is a useful tool that teaches as they play. I highly recommend this wallet. I do wish there were more color choices, but I solved the problem by &#34;monogramming&#34; each wallet with their initial."
0,1,"The money is more realistic than most.  The wallet is much bigger than expected however, and could not even fit into an adult pocket.  Also, the change tends to fall out of the plastic view area, best to keep it in the zippered pocket on the outside.  Paper money needs to be trained to fold correctly in the wallet (very stiff).  Overall good product."
1,0,I choice this cooking set because it looks sturdy and durable and not easily damaged.  Liked the bright colors of the set.
0,1,both grandchildren love it so much and play with the other set and this. I like the quality so both of us are happy.
0,1,MY boys are very rough on toys but these are holding up fine!They fit perfect on a number of diff kinda play kitchen!!!Would deff buy from learning resources any time!
0,1,"My son loves it. I just wish it were a little more durable,other than that it is a great product."
0,1,Great first addition to my 3 year olds play kitchen.  She loves to pretend to cook our favorites.  Durable and well made.  A great value
0,1,the string is less than a foot long..my daughter can't even raise her hand while sitting in front of it...so we took it off the string...and the tune on each metal sounds fine...but when you try playing the music on the paper...it sounds off...like there's a note missing or some thing...its good quality but due to it being mounted on plastic...it doesn't sound as good as i HOPED...mind you ...i had higher hopes than what i probably should have...i'd buy this again yes...and just add my own length or string to is...and i love the fact when she's walking..it can be wheeled along.
0,1,It's not too loud and I love that it's all one piece (no missing parts)! As always with Little Tikes this toy is very durable!
0,1,"This toy spent more time at the bottom of the toy box then anywhere else. I hated that my daughter would shove the mallet in her mouth (babies chew on everything) I was spending more time worrying about her gagging herself with it then I was with if she would have fun playing it. She never really cared to bang on it. she just wanted to chew on it. Now my 4 year old liked to ""play"" it right.. but it didnt really make that loud of sound and she had to wack it pretty good."
0,1,"This is a great alternative to the turtle sandbox everybody seems to have in their yard. Our little guy has loved it this summer. Beware parents, the claws look like great places to sit, but only for the little people! My husband caved one side in that we just can't get to pop back out. Not a manufacturing flaw, though, just user error. We would highly recommend. Another quality product from Step2."
1,0,"love this for my grandchildren, find it to be the perfect size, simple to set up and dump sand in...and look for the Crayola colored sand!"
1,0,"My son absolutely loved this sandbox. We put in about 250 lbs of sand and it worked great. There are a few important points to be aware of:1) If there are cats around, make sure to put the cover back on when not in use.2) Once the sand is in, it is near impossible to move so make sure you have it where you want it before pouring sand in.3) The Phoenix, Arizona summer heat is hot enough to warp the lid so it no longer fits properly over the sandbox itself."
0,1,"My baby got this for his 1st birthday and really loves it! It is bright and eyecatching and sits just right in the corner of our deck. The lid is easy to put on and off and nice and light, although does not blow off in the wind. It holds at least 4 bags of play sand from Home Depot and could easily hold more. It can hold 3 toddlers comfortably and has provided lots of fun so far! The one and only issue is that i often sit on the front claws so i can play with my baby, they have now dented badly...and i am not hugely heavy either! There was no mention of not sitting on it, so i had thought it would be durable enough. This isn't to put anyone off from buying this sandbox..just don't perch on the end of it!"
0,1,I got this to put together at the beach.  I figured my mother and sisters would want to do it with me.  It ended up being my dad and partner who spent hours working on it.  They really enjoyed it and I enjoyed doing it with them.  The picture is truly magnificent.  Love the puzzle and the quality.
0,1,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing a puzzle that I received for free through the Vine program.This is another good puzzle from this company (Ravensburger). The image is bright and fun and exciting. The size, 1000 pieces, means it is a challenge that will take at least a few days to complete. The durability/manufacturing quality is the usual (good) from this company.Daughter (autistic) is working on this puzzle now, and it has kept her happy for a couple of days so far. (we have a whole stack of other Ravensburger puzzles that she's already completed, and she likes to go back and do some of them again and again; this will probably be one of those she wants to keep in her rotation)."
0,1,I like to get puzzles for my dad. He really enjoys them as long as they are not too difficult. This is a beautiful puzzle but 1000 pieces were a bit much for him without a little help. The pieces are bright and fit together nicely. It took several sessions to finish. It is a beautiful puzzle and the glow in the dark aspect is really cool. Everyone complimented him on his new beautiful puzzle!  Highly recommended!
1,0,"At this very moment, as Hurricane Dennis blows tropical storm winds and rain outside, my sons and husband are having a blast with this game.After one round each of Candyland and Chutes and Ladders, hubby pulled out this long forgotten toy.  Voila!  Something the 5 year old and 2 year old can both play (as well as the 36 year old, apparently).Is it loud? Yes! Is it disorganized? Of course!  As the mother of two little boys, I can tell you - that's what they love about it!Save it for your next rainy day. You won't regret it."
0,1,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew not realizing - DUH - it won't stick to a stainless steel refrigerator!  So as long as you can find an alternative location for this toy, it's pretty fun.  We played with it on the dishwasher a few times but it was a little too short.  Really would work best on a fridge :("
1,0,I gave a set to an adult friend 2 years ago.  He ask for more last Christmas.  He says everyone visiting his kitchen plays with them.
0,1,These are really fun.  The more of the accessories the better as you can get really creative.  Adults even have fun with them!  Would not reccoment for kids under 8 or so as they take some understanding of basic physics-type info  (weight pushes which way etc.)
0,1,"This does not work at all unless you throw it off a mountain.  At home, it just goes up like a lump and comes down the same.  Very disappointed.  If I weren't so lazy, I would have returned it."
0,1,"We received a blue paratrooper with a black and blue parachute and black netting. My 5 year old is having a great time with this toy. He wants to play with it everyday. He takes the toy upstairs to the 2nd floor and throws it off. The paratrooper floats down ever so nicely. Sometimes, other toys hitch a ride.  The toy is very durable and isn't breaking despite the rough use. The low price and fun factor make this toy a must purchase!!"
0,1,Very durable toy. Hours of fun for the kids. Only downfall is they require an awful amount of effort. Kids eventually gave up and asked me to throw them for them while they caught them before they hit the ground. Need a workout give em a shot.
1,0,"The no-tangle design works and my son loves it.  However, grandpa and I have had to throw this thing up in the air 100 times and we both needed advil afterwards.  It is worth it to see him running around to catch it."
0,1,"This is an adorable doll with a very sweet little face, and soft and light enough for my 15-month-old, who ADORES her baby. She loves tucking it in, putting it ""night-night"" and in general just toting it around and cuddling it. Perfect first baby for a little girl!"
0,1,When my daughter was 9 months old her grandmother bought this baby for her for Christmas. My daughter is now 3 and she is inseparable from this baby. It has taken a lot of abuse and still looks great. She gets washed all the time and has held up nicely. This baby is nice and plush and soft. Great for newborns and up.
0,1,I got this doll for my grand daughter and she is so soft and cuddly.  She is the perfect size for little hands to hold and yet will last for many years to come.  Perfect first doll!
0,1,This doll is perfect for baby due to its soft body and light weight. Easy for little hands to hold.
1,0,"Bought this for my daughters so they could experience a game I played growing up. I wish they gave a plastic box to store the cards in. Other than that, it was fun like old times!"
1,0,This is a great card game.  I loved playing it as a child and so glad my daughter loves it too.  She's really good at it as well.
0,1,What a fun and great card game to keep around whether it be for adults or children.  It's better to have at leas 4 packs around so that more people can play along.  The cost is inexpensive and you can add your own twist to the game.  So glad this is a game that you can always find.
0,1,Who does not love you know? I simply bought this for my grandchildren to play when they come over to my apartment. We do play everyone has a great time it's a wonderful thing to bring families together I recommend it.
1,0,"i needed a kitchen for my 3 yr old daughter that would fit into a very small space...but one that was enjoyable to play with.  we received it very quickly, in time for her birthday, and although she has not played with it yet; i did a test run on it and it seems to be made very well; especially for the price.  it is small but has many different little areas that she can work on that either slide out or open up.  It would probably be difficult for more than two children, max,  to really play with this at the same time (again b/c of the size) unless they had some other accompanying toys like table and chairs so that one child could be the chef and the others could help preapre the food at the table or be the customers, taking turns, etc...  as for the tipping over part that another reviewer mentioned, hers will be against a wall; as i think most people have their toy kitchens so i dont think that would be a problem.  in all; a good basic kitchen for a great price."
0,1,"Although Chicco no longer makes this item, I was able to find an unopened one in the original box on-line from a vendor. I paid $99.00 for it, and it is worth its weight in gold! Perfect size! Lots and lots of extras! Great colors for a boy or girl! One burner on the stove top makes a sizzling sound and lights up, and the other one makes a boiling sound and lights up. On the bottom front of the kitchen set is the oven and on the back side on the bottom is the refrigerator. The kitchen ware and play food are the most adorable I have ever seen. With a little patience and effort, I hope you can locate one, too. If not, I would not hesitate to buy a used one in good condition."
0,1,"We got a good deal on this as a Lightning Deal for Christmas, so that probably helps me love it more than if I had paid full price.I have been wanting to get my 8 year old daughter some sort of dollhouse for awhile. She loves Calico Critters, and the Nursery she received for her birthday last year was of good quality.I usually prefer wood over plastic, as it's more durable, but I am overall quite impressed with this Deluxe Village House. It came almost completely assembled, and for plastic, it is very high quality.My only complaint is that the stairs and some of the railings don't like to stay attached. But other than that, it is wonderful."
0,1,"This is the best house! I got my little 8 year old freind the townhouse first, and that was great, but then we ordered this one, and this one is huge! So many rooms, and so cute. I love how nice of a quality is....and she plays with it every single day!"
0,1,"Not all the furniture fits well in areas. Daughter still loves it, but it would be nice if the ceilings were tall enough for their own furniture."
0,1,"As a little girl, I remember how cool something was if it was in miniature AND had moving parts. This kitchen set delivers all plus more.The kitchen set is nicely made with a lot of details. All the drawers come out, the oven opens, the refrigerator has shelves not only inside but in the door and the rest of the accessories are perfect. There is a toaster that you can put the bread into, a scale, cookies and a baking tray, a clear refrigerator drawer, lots of vegetables, milk, ice cream, placemats, cutting boards, utensils, etc.There are a lot of little pieces so we are careful when we are done to pick up all the pieces. This is not the set to play on a shag carpet or out in the grass :-).A really cute set."
0,1,"I'm amazed how well this is made. It even comes with a bunch of food & a fridge!! So if you need dollhouse furniture, I recommend you get this! ^-^"
0,1,"I bought this hoping it would fit Fisher Price Loving Family adults. Although the adults are a tiny bit longer than the bed, I was able to make it work. I bent the doll slightly at the hips, the head rested on the pillow and it fit!...just barely, but my granddaughter was happy. It is a handsome bedroom suite at an excellent price. We were both very happy."
1,0,my baby grand daughter loves the beds because she likes to take them apart.  They are easy to put together again too for her tiny 2 yr. old hands.
0,1,"My toddler son has had this about a year, and it has been put to every toddler test known to man. Still looks new!! Great for bath, beach, back yard, etc. So glad we have this and the articulated loader. Lots of real life details. No worries for safety."
0,1,This toy delivered on all it promised. I imagine it will be in active play for several years. A very good choice as a first truck for a toddler.
0,1,"My son loves this dump truck! He loves filling it with his duplos and driving it around. He also loves hooking up the Bruder Roadmax trailer and dumping the duplo blocks back and forth. He absolutely loves putting his duplo people in the cab of the truck, he usually had a little man driving and a dog in the passenger seat... so cute! It's a great quality, it really takes a beating with him (he just turned two.)"
0,1,"what can  say it's a Bruder, and they are awesome toys. My son loves that it actually works like a real garbage truck. A playroom favorite"
0,1,"Harder to get into than I first thought.  The kids are anxious to get to ""work"" and fidget getting into this, the arms are a bit too tight.  It seems bulky as well.  Better off going old school - daddy's old shirt on backwards!"
0,1,"I'm very happy with this purchase for my developing artist who is 2 1/2 yrs old. Living in the caribbean, the sleeves are a bit long but it's exactly what you need for experimenting artists...so I just crank up the air conditioner to not let my artist sweat too much.Update........it is now 2013 (7 years later), and my daughter still uses this apron at age 9 (a very tall age 9) It has withstood time and use. Very satisfied."
0,1,"Not worth the money; poor quality, too lightweight.  I thought it would be a lot nicer because I like the company."
0,1,"My daughter loves art projects so I order this drop cloth to protect the carpet from paint and marker stains. It does what it's supposed to do. There are no spills that seep through the plastic and it has held up well. However, since it is plastic, when folded, it kind of sticks together a bit (even when clean and dry), and if she's not wearing shoes/socks, her feet stick a bit as she walks over it.For a toddler, the size seems right though I wouldn't use it for more than one child at a time. It's not big enough for collaborative art projects. I'm not a fan of the appearance since it's busy and that distracts from any art projects, but that's just my opinion as the adult not my daughter's opinion as the primary person actually using the drop cloth. Overall, it's a good value for the price and quality though I've been considering putting a canvas paint cloth over it for less stick when we're painting barefoot in the summer."
0,1,"Purchased this to go under our easel, and it works fine.  It is very thin plastic however.  Not worried about it ripping, but if you have a kid that moves around a lot, this won't stay smooth.  The more expensive one we purchased from a different catalogue is much better, though this is easier to clean since can just wad it up in a bathtub or utility sink."
0,1,We have the set by the same name brand that come in a fish that holds the markers. They are great! We bought these as replacements to put in the fish...they are HORRIBLE!!! They fall apart when my daughter tries to draw and the sponge that is meant for cleaning the marker...all it does is smear it! HORRIBLE!!! My daughter LOVED the 1st set! Used them in the tub at least once a day until they were nubs! I dont know whats was wrong with this set?!?
0,1,"I bought 4 of these. At the time, the price was great, but over the past few months it's fluctuated dramatically. Mostly upwards.  I think I got a deal.Here's the issues I have.1. There's a site for Europe and one for the US. Both are different. I found the European site to have better FAQ's and information easier to find, but it had bad links.  The US site had its own problems as well. Some issues with getting to the needed information there. Inconsistency leads my small, male brain to confusion.2. The directions aren't very good out of the box.3. The US site also isn't great for someone who buys multiple ones and who wants the critters shipped to different locations. It forgets your country, but doesn't show you an easy way to re-enter it. Had to start as if I was a new user each time to get around the glitch. The website needs some TLC.4. There was quite an inconsistency in the orders I received. One had large caterpillars in it (over 1 inch each), and they all survived. Another had much smaller ones (under 1/2 an inch each), and not all of them survived.Eventually, hunting between both the US and European sites, I was able to get most of the information I was looking for.I also called the company and they did help straighten out a shipping issue.There's actually a competitors site that was much more informative though. The competitors site also contained things like links to pictures you could print so the kids could draw and learn. Seems this other place put much more effort into to the educational aspects of this adventure than these guys did.A good internet search will give you plenty of information that is lacking at this companies site.Here's a link to the drawings you can print for the kids.http://www.thebutterflysite.com/activities.shtmlAnother site for good Butterfly FAQ'shttp://www.butterflywebsite.com/faq.cfmAlso, the BBC did a 1 hour show called &#34;The Incredible Story Of The Monarch Butterfly&#34;.  It was available on YouTube.com last I looked.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U-VZdfAcZ8Overall, for the price I paid, I was happy with the product.Last weekend we let the first ones go. That was fun!"
0,1,"We got this for Christmas and just received our caterpillars.  It is absolutely unreal that we are doing this in our house.  And really freaky too.  These teeny, tiny caterpillars arrived in two cups, and they have seriously grown like 50 times their original size.  They just started cocoon-ing today.  One BIG TIP: don't order the caterpillars unless you have warm weather because 2-3 weeks after you receive the caterpillars, you have butterflies on your hands.  And they need to be released!"
1,0,"This is a great present/educational toy.  My son received it for his third birthday, and even though he did not appreciate it perhaps as much as an older child might, he still found the metamorphosis process fascinating.  We released the butterflies last week, and he still looks for ""his"" butterflies whenever we're outside.The reason this does not get five stars from me, however, is that all subsequent containers of caterpillars cost $14.99.  (The pavilion comes with a $5 coupon for the first set of caterpillars.)  This means that, over the span of a year, assuming you order four kits (not unreasonable when our first metamorphosis cycle ran approximately ten days, and children learn through repetition and anticipation), the entire experience will set you back $70.  Pretty expensive for a mesh toy, I think."
1,0,These hold up very well with little ones using them. They also are very safe and little ones don't get hurt when using them.
0,1,"My daughter loves to color and draw. She has a large variety of colored pencils but when I saw these I realized she does not have any metallic ones yet, so I got her this set with a Dover 'patterns' coloring book. Crayola is always a nice brand for colored pencils. I have tried other brands from the dollar store and cheap brands in other stores and they just don't color very smoothly. These metallics are like all Crayola pencils - they give a nice easy, smooth glide when coloring and blending. Using the metallics all on their own looks really cool, but it also is nice to use them along with other regular color pencils for a nice effect. Whether a kid having fun coloring, or an older art student, Crayola is a nice brand to choose."
0,1,Not bad product for the price however I expected it to be a little shinier then what it was but all and all it was a good product
0,1,"I used these paints for my 5 month old baby to paint a pumpkin on Halloween!!!  I was worried about her eating the paint, since everything goes in her mouth these days.  First, she actually never ate the paint so that's good. But second, after reading lots online someone had a good point, once they try & they realize it tastes gross, they're not going to keep eating it. And it is non-toxic & I was going to be there the whole time, so not really a big deal.  Needless to say she got the paint on me & all over the outfit she was wearing.  The paint was super easy to get off our skin, no scrubbing, it just started flaking off & every little bit washed out of our clothes!!  I'm happy & will continue to buy this water color paint for any other art projects as she gets older!!"
1,0,my kids love that they can choose from different colors and be able to paint all they want! Super happy that we got this!
0,1,"Being the fingerpaint fairy with four nephews and a niece I can tell you from experience that these are the best finger paints. They are vibrant, richly pigmented, and dry fairly well.Pros1) great color selection2) great color saturation3) decently easy clean up (water washable even from clothing, walls, floors, ceilings, chairs, hair, faces, brother's legos, etc.)4) small enough quantities that the kid should still be in high school when the artwork is dry, even if they use all of every color on a single work. (not that they've ever done that. well, more than three times each at any rate)5) great feel - not too slimy, not too gluey, but also not too splashyCons1) the small amount in each bottle means these are one-child containers. but, IMO, better that than one kid dumping out all of the 12 oz of red (if the containers were bigger) so his brother can't have any (not that that has EVER happened)Tip: Use larger heavy weight paper if your kid(s) like to pour it on and squish it around... water color paper is perfect."
0,1,"I purchased this for my younger daughter as a shape sorting toy. It worked great, she easily opened the roof to retrieve the shapes. Solid wood construction. Because it is a house, my older daughter also enjoyed it, but played with it in a different way obviously. She used it as a barn for wooden animals."
0,1,"It is a good idea, and I like that it is made of wood and is nontoxic, however, my son just likes to lift up the &#34;roof' and then put the blocks into it that way, so it's not really being used as a sorter... maybe if the roof wasn't as easy to life up.  Also, since there is only one block that fits into the corresponding shape, and if the corresponding hole is on the other side of the house, he doesn't turn it around.  They should probably include 2 blocks of each shape with the toy.  It is very sturdy and well made though, and is cute."
1,0,"I love the wooden shape sorter, much cuter than the plastic toys. My daughter loves that the sides flip open so she can grab shapes easily. There are other toys that keep her attention longer, but overall a great buy!"
1,0,"We have a shelf above my son's changing table that has hooks along the bottom of it.  Along these hooks we hang toys to keep his attention while we change diapers (along with all the supplies handy on the shelf above).  Anyway, for months now Tucker has been one of his favorites.  He still likes it and he's 22 months old."
1,0,"Tucker was given to my son when he was about 4 months old.  He loved it instantly.  Now that he is almost 8 months old, he still loves it.  I keep it in the car for him to play with because it's guaranteed to keep his interest.  He loves to chew on the rings attached to Tucker's 'tail'.  It is very durable, too.  I have washed it several times because it fell on the ground and it is holding up well!  I definately recommend this toy!  :)"
1,0,"Tucker is not only cute, cuddly, & very soft. He is also entertaining, loveable, & very durable. His head is squeaky, he can have all of his legs and his head put back into his shell, and has a mirror on his under carriage. He is covered with lots of bright coloring with differnt shapes and patterns. My daughter got him when she was 2 months old and it's has been a tucker love affair ever since then. She is now 7 and half months old and we take him with us everywhere. I throw him right into the wash with my baby's clothing and he comes out brand new every time. About the only thing I would change about tucker are the rings attached to his tail. They are too large for my baby to fit in her mouth, which she finds annoying. At this age when babies are teething, they should really make him a little more teething friendly"
0,1,"My kids love this toy. I have a nine month old daughter who absolutely adores Celeste. Celeste was actually a hand-me-down from my Two-Year old son, who still plays with it as well. My son has a great time showing the different sounds, rattles and squeaks to my little girl. This one won't disappoint."
0,1,"I bought this for my daughter's dinosaur party, to aid in fossil making as an activity.  Our party guests pushed dinos into a disc of Model Magic and it really showed the detail!  When I was trying to determine which compound would be best for this activity (play-doh, clay, etc) I couldn't really find info on what this FELT like, so I'll try to describe that.  The Model Magic compound is almost like a foamy, airy play-doh.  My favorite thing about it is that it DOESN'T BREAK OR CRUMBLE like Play-doh.  So awesome!  You actually have to work kind of hard to break it apart.  I will definitely be buying this again.  They should make little food factories for it like they do for Play-doh!  I'm unsure of whether or not it would work in a Play-doh toy - it would be worth a try!"
0,1,"I like these, but you have to be very careful with the caps.  When a child closes them, they seem closed but are not fully locked.  And if they aren't fully locked, they dry out.  They thus require more vigilance than I would like to keep them working.  Having said that, they do exactly what they claim.  They work on the special paper and don't stain anything else your small child draw on (i.e., everything).  I thus recommend them with the proviso to keep an eye on them."
0,1,"This is a great set, with more markers than you know what to do with and the best part....washable!  Great deal for the price."
0,1,As a mom it is a must to buy everything washable and these markers are just that. I am very impressed with the amount of markers and variety of colors available. My daughter loves them.
0,1,3 year old granddaughter loves to play with these.  They are so realistic.  She is always preparing sandwiches for everyone.  I'm sure she will have years of fun with these.
0,1,Great item.  This is very high quality.  a  b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p
0,1,"How much fun is it to assemble your own sandwich!  The Velcro in the middle of each piece makes them stay together.  The tuna can even has a pop top!  I'm not sure if we received 4 slices of cheese, or if the luncheon meat and the cheese look alike, but my grandson doesn't seem to notice.  I purchased this set with two other Small World sets - the peel and slice fruits and vegetables.  I later purchased a set of pots and pans with utensils.  I am impressed with the quality of the Small World items.  I was not familiar with them before this, but I will now think of them as a quality toy producer as I do Little Tikes and Fisher-Price"
1,0,My grandson loves these.  This is a good fine motor activity for a three year old who isn't interested in coloring yet.  He is very careful as he fills in the circles.  Definitely a hit at our house.
0,1,"We use these for projects and my 29 month old loves them. I have been using them only for special preschool activities so we can keep them fresh longer, but they seem like they'll last a while (they're big markers and seem to be full of ink). The orange got kind of messy, but nothing I don't really expect with markers. We print off free printables with letters to use these on to teach him letters, and I also have him tell me what color marker he wants (he only gets one at a time). Pretty happy with all the ways I can use these at home to teach him."
0,1,"A necessity to give along with a Do A Dot &#34;coloring&#34; book.  It's a fun way for kids to color pictures, especially for younger children who may not have yet mastered coloring within the lines."
0,1,Very bright colors and easy to use. My boys love these markers and it keeps them occupied for a long time!
0,1,"I got these for my kids when my 7 year old got a concussion and had to rest for a week.  All three of my kids (ages 7,5, and almost 2) continue to spend hours using these.  The color looks great and they are lasting a long time.  I highly recommend this product!"
0,1,I bought these for my 3.5 year old daughter and she loves them. I love that they are not very messy.I was a preschool teacher a number of years ago and these were always popular. There are quite a few Do A Dot worksheets that you can print of the internet to work on letter and number skills with your preschooler.
0,1,"This is a great idea.  Since I do not live with my grandson, I don't know if he has tried them.  I bought only one book  until I know he can handle the paint.  These paint things are pretty heavy."
0,1,"I have had two sets of these given my kids at different times and they were a big disappointment. A great idea but these ones are essentially expensive bingo dabbers and the tips came off very quickly and the paint flowed everywhere.I found Alex to make a much better version and they have lasted us a long time, despite the fact that they are much smaller than the do-a-dot ones. Although the do-a-dot books are good (thick paper, interesting themes), I have found the Melissa & Doug's Jumbo Coloring Pads to be excellent quality and over-all much better value considering their price point on amazon."
1,0,These will provide your kids with tons of hours of fun. Theyre wonderful for so many art projects and tuning fine motor skills. Theyre also much less messy than traditional stamp pads or finger paints but kids love using them.
1,0,"Maybe I didn't read properly, I will check the description.  Don't buy these for toddlers because they are 100% not washable off hands...what a disaster :-("
0,1,for my grand daughter this will be a new way to color which he loves to do.  And you can even het special dot art books to us.
0,1,"Hours of fun for kids that like to be creative.  We even used these and a roll of heavy white paper to make wrapping paper whenever we have a birthday party to go to, which my girls are super excited to give because it has their own personal touch.  We have four sets and it still seems like they are always all in use! Worth the money."
1,0,"This is fantastic. My 18-month old can play with them and enjoy them about as much as my 3-year old. The dot-a-dot can be used to learn proper handling of writing-device, and this is the first step when learning to write. You can color on so many different surfaces as well, you can color(cover) any drawing with dots. You can mix colors and this is such a fascinating exploration for my 3-year old. If you really want to use it for ""curriculum"" education, you can dot-trace letters and numbers and shapes, to get the kids used to the shapes. You can teach counting, and number awareness, by putting down 5 dots and counting them, or count as the child fills circles with teh markers. You can color 3 red dots and 5 yellow ones next to the red and 8 orange right below:2 things accomplishes, just as the color mix, the numbers mix to give you a new number...boom...so diverse! But of all, it's for fun, for the kids to enjoy. It's washable successfully before it dries, afterwards there is some struggle."
0,1,My kids love doing art with their dot colors. I am now going to buy more colors since the basics does not come with brown and pink.
0,1,My kids love these paints and so do I.  They are easy to use and the mess is basically none.  I rated the durability at 4 because if you don't tighten the lids they will dry out.  There is some educational value by combining colors and making other colors.
0,1,"These are great, the little ones love to color with these, so much easier than crayons and markers for their little hands. They last quite a while and the colors are great."
0,1,These are great!  I ordered these Markers to go with the Do A Dot Art Books for my little two year old preschool class.  However they are a lot cheaper at Michaels or Teachers Store.
0,1,This book & tape came quickly & in great condition. We are very happy with this. We had just taken the little ones to Storybook Land & they loved it. So this book fit the bill for them to hear more about their favorite Mother Goose stories.
1,0,"In concept, this is a great toy.  I love that it is wooden and not made in China.  You whack a ball and the next one pops up.Problem is that nothing really keeps the balls in the thing.  It is now sitting empty on my living room floor (after 10 days of play) and I have no clue where the 1 yr old (or maybe his older 4 yr old brother) has put the balls."
0,1,"My son was about one when we bought this for him.  He had zero interest in using it as it is made to be used.  The balls were all over (a couple are missing now) and the hammer is mainly used for other things.  We thought he would ""grow into it,"" but at two and a half, he still has no interest in it's real function.  For around the same price we could have gotten a more interesting Plan ball & hammer toy that he would have enjoyed more."
0,1,Bought crane for grandsons birthday.  He loves it. Going to take it to the beach.  Had one for my other grandson who never got off of it at the beach.  This g son uses it to dig holes for his mother to plant flowers
0,1,"The Melissa and Doug line of toys are very durable and well made, in general. This puzzle is not exception. It has held up to being put together, taken apart, and repeat many times. It has held up well to three children playing with it at various times. The puzzle is not too difficult that a four year old child is able to do this puzzle. The colors are bright and pretty.Enjoy."
0,1,"Grandson-5 yrs, and granddaughter 3 yrs love this colorful puzzle.  The love laying on the floor and putting it together(of course with some help at this state).  They can do quite a lot alone as there is plenty of pattern to follow and it reminds them of the acquarium where they  go now and then.  recommend  Good quality."
0,1,"My mom got this for my nearly 4 year old daughter, and she loves it.  It is big, bold, and beautiful colors, and a nice size that we can do together.  I find that sometimes Melissa & Doug toys don't live up to the hype in terms of quality; not so with this...it is gorgeous!"
0,1,These are okay.  They're not fabulous and I'd prefer them in plastic now that I have them.  Plastic would make them easier to wash!
0,1,"So fun.  The kids in my class want to play this game over and over and over.  They can play alone or with a partner.  I love the storage bag because it list all the pieces and how many of each, so we never lose a piece."
0,1,"Our 5 yr old loves this game, which he got for Christmas.  Such a cool concept.  Love the little travel bag as well."
0,1,"We bought this for our preschoolers (4 and 2 years old), and they've had a lot of fun playing with it. I feel like the game is teaching them problem-solving skills, trying different alternatives, perseverance, etc. There are a lot of little pieces, so you really have to stay on top of them to pack everything back up into the carrying bag when they're done."
1,0,"One of the few toys in my daughter's discomboomerated house (small house, 2 year old triplets & 5 year old) that all the pieces have stayed together and not been scattered all over.Comes with a bag for storage.5 year old grandaughter is able to do the level 1 set-ups.  I have seen a similar game as an Android app (Mouse Trap).  You basically duplicate the set-up as shown on a card and then slide the pieces to let the ice cream truck travel completely across the board.Great little game to take somewhere and play.  Not too big to tote around, not so small as to get easily lost."
0,1,My kids think this is the best. They like the more advanced puzzles because they enjoy the satisfaction of figuring out the ones that seem impossible. They're usually surprised when they've gotten to the end!
0,1,We love this set. It has 250 pieces and is absolutely perfect. I can model a pattern for my boys and then they can both copy or complete the pattern. It is incredibly sturdy and wonderfully constructed. The blocks are bright and the texture is great.
1,0,These are the perfect size for my 15 month old kiddo. She puts everything in her mouth and I didn't have to worry about her swallowing these. They are as described - jumbo magnetic numbers. They have small magnets on the back of them (not something that little ones can get their teeth on and swallow). The only thing that I am a little disappointed with is that there are a handful that do not stay put on the fridge as is the same with the jumbo letters. They slide to the bottom and fall off. Otherwise they are great!
1,0,"I was unhappy with all the cheap doctor sets out there, and my 3 year old son was unimpressed by them. I have a lot of health issues, and have been hospitalized multiple times, so playing doctor is one of the ways my son deals with his anxieties and fears about it all. Its really given him a sense of empowerment to understand what hospitals are for and what doctors really do. So this Christmas I decided to make him a QUALITY doctor set, something that would help him learn and expand as opposed to a bunch of plastic dodads that would just take up space in the play area.This stethoscope was the absolute icing on the cake for his set. He use to pretend to listen to peoples heart with the pretend plastic one that came with his doctor costume, but now he can ACTUALLY listen to heartbeats thanks to this. He listens to EVERYONE that will let him (especially enjoys listening to mama's belly since baby brother is in there and due very soon.) Its worth every cent."
0,1,I was quite surprised my the quality of this toy. The bacon is flimsy in a good way. The strawberries come in a little bowl. Super cute! It also all came in a decently made basket with handles for good storage after playtime is over. My 3yr old loves it!
0,1,"This basket contains 2 slices of bacon, small bowl, butter slice, egg, muffin, orange juice in a cup, pancake, 7 strawberries.Learning Resources food is so realistic.  The bacon is also bendable!  The butter slice will surely get lost soon (small enough that some parents might want to put away because it is a choking hazard.  We play that the muffin is a chocolate cup cake (It looks more like a dessert).  The orange juice cannot be ""taken"" out of the cup.By the way, I contacted Learning Resources about the safety of their plastic and this is their response.""We take safety very seriously and all of our products meet or exceed safety standards.

0,1,Bought this for an addition to a play kitchen that we bought our sons for Christmas.  They LOVED itand got it for a wonderful price at the holidays. Especially since it seems so expensive to buy play food at stores.  The piece of cake was the big hit and a lot of fun to watch the young kids think it's real.  More fun for the adults to watch.  Good learning tool to teach young kids whats what.  But GREAT addition to play kitchens.  Sturdy basket and food.  I believe though that we had to temporarily take away the lettuce because of our 21 month old chewing on it.  Can't tell if that would hold up to being chewed on.
0,1,"This kitchen is a hit with our 2-year-old and 4-year-old girls!  I wanted a model that was large enough for them both to play together.  Many of the other kitchens were too compact.  The sound effects: running water, sizzling grill, and boiling water are fun to hear.  We did have a few issues, however. The instructions are frustrating. Just graphics - no text or explanations.  We had to stretch a coat hanger underneath the top to reach the wiring for the grill. There were no pre-existing top holes for the plastic phone holder.  Since it was Christmas Eve we had to resort to our own large drill bit to create two additional holes.  After all that trouble, the jack fell back out Christmas Day.  And the phone rings surprisingly soft!  And is it me, or does a ""hot"" stove seem like a strange place for a baby doll seat? Other than that the kitchen is constructed of sturdy plastic.  After so many electronic gadgets where you just push a button, my family welcomes a toy that requires a little imagination to have a lot of fun."
0,1,"Bought this game for my son who will be 3 soon and he loves this game. He even asks if he can stay up late at night to p,ay his fish game haha. (of course we don't let him though). I like how the rods are, I remember when i was a kid the one i had, had a string hanging off the rod with a magnet but the rods would always get tangled when you left them together when the game wasn't being played with. This version that doesn't happen. Game seems like good quality. Yes kids can get their fingers caught in the empty hole but all you need to do is sit with your kids while they are playing this to keep an eye on them."
0,1,"My 3 year old thinks this toy is really fun.  He likes using the &#34;fishing catcher&#34; to catch the fish and count how many he has caught.  Catching the fish requires some hand/eye coordination.  When turned on the toy is pretty loud but not annoying.  Like other reviews have said, it is made of cheap plastic and definitely reminds me of the toys I played with growing up in the 80's and early 90's but for a toy that costs $9 I can't really complain.  It's certainly not my favorite toy but my 3 year old loves it!"
0,1,"I have 2 grandchildren approx. 2-1/2 yrs old.  They were about 2 when I purchased this.  They enjoy it when they come over.  We play together for about 10 - 15 minutes which is about their attention span right now, but it is a toy they will bring out to play with where many are gathering dust.Its easy enough for a 2 year old and fun enough for an older child to play with it.  A younger child will hold the pole rather than letting the string hang down and stick the pole into the mouth of fish.  They get a kick out of catching them.It's a game they will always come back for."
0,1,"First of all, there is no music in this game but that doesnt make it a negative.This is a classic game - it goes a little too quickly but that's a challenge. Because of the non-adjustable speed, it was frustrating for my 3 year old. Even for adults, it took some effort to get the hang of it. Now at 5, it is easier for her. So I will recommend this for a 4 or 5 year old... I just cannot see how a 2 year old can manage the hand-eye motor coordination skills for this.So this game is fantastic in that helps develop that skill and once you get the hang of it, it can be a little obsessive. It also helps kids develop patience which is great. Lastly, since it's a game, it helps them understand the concepts of winning and losing.Highly recommend."
0,1,"This is another toy that's on my Fail-Safe list.  The fish rotate and gobble their mouths open and shut. The kids use the little fishing poles to try to connect to the magnetized part inside the fish mouths.  The one negative is the quality of the materials -- it's on the low side, bit flimsy bit cheap. If there were a sturdier version of this toy, I would be willing to pay more for it."
1,0,"I got this for my 10 year old, and she couldn't compress it in the slightest.  Even I had trouble making it pump up and down.  Probably meant for expert adults."
0,1,This is a nice pogo stick and I am happy to have purchased it for my son.My only observation would be to pay attention to the weight requirements (clearly spelled out in the description). My boy is barely the 80 pounds this stick is rated for and with how stiff the spring is I think a child that weighed less would have a very difficult time bouncing properly.
1,0,This is a great toy to get kids moving. It tires you out as it works on balance and coordination. Kids dont get enough exercise and this is a fun way to do it. Would highly reccommend for kids and adults. Lots of fun. This was purchased a year ago and it is still holding up well to a lot of use.
0,1,"It's bouncy wouncy flouncy pouncy fun fun fun fun fun......It's been going strong for nearly 3 months and taken my 7 yr old son all over the house, yard, and park. It's a fabulous way for him to burn off some of that seemingly endless energy."
1,0,"Our 6 year old grandson had been wanting a pogo stick, but he's a lightweight; so we were limited as to which one he was actually heavy enough to use.  He seemed to have a good start with it on Christmas day; but took it home and we haven't heard anything since.  Hope that it meets his needs."
1,0,"I bought this for my 8 year old last Christmas and she has enjoyed it very much.  She now weighs right at 40 lbs and she can pogo for a long time.  The pogo stick is very durable but certainly cannot deal with a grown-up's weight.  It's great exercise for her because she always gets a good work-out when using it.  I had a pogo stick when I was a kid and absolutely loved it.The only thing about this pogo stick which I think could have been done better and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, is that the handle could have been wider.  It's very narrow giving a small space for each hand to hold onto.  I think it would be easy for a kid to accidentally let go of or allow his/her hand to slide and lose hold of the bar.  But so far my kid hasn't so maybe that's an unnecessary worry on my part."
0,1,It seems nice and sturdy but my 6 year old daughter has a hard time jumping on it.  It is very stiff and takes a lot of energy to get it to go down enough to get a small jump out of it.  My husband tried it and it held up to his weight but my daughter has been pretty disappointed.
0,1,"My 22 month-old grandson is obsessed with vacuum cleaners and LOVES his Hoover. It looks and sounds real, although the sound is too soft to be scary. Based on previous reveiwers' complaints about the front falling off, I left the accessory door taped shut as it was when it arrived. He hasn't noticed, and the clear tape keeps everything together. He's dropped it, banged it around, and even vacuumed the lawn.  Everything is still in one piece. I don't care that it doesn't actually pick up dirt.  It's a TOY!"
0,1,I got this for Christmas for my 3 1/2 year old grandson.  He absolutely loves pulling the wagon on walks around the block with me & when he gets tired of walking he rides!
0,1,"I just bought this item yesterday....Went directly to Toys R Us and bought mine for the same price..Our is a different color and the mobile is musical...This nursery center is EXTREMELY DURABLE and well worth the money spent..This item has a bed on one side, sink with faucet, bath tub, area with hangers to hang doll clothes and also shelves with lots of space to put baby items on it..It does come with a few baby items such as baby powder, lotion, and a baby bottle..The bath tub is soooo cute...The shower head is a sprayer that has the little tube that goes down in through the top part of the table so that the kids have room to move it out without pulling out the shower head to give their babys' a bath and there is little yellow things that come out when you push the button on the shower head to be pretend water coming out of it...The faucet moves and so does the handle..The only gripe is there is no locking device for the faucet that is above the sink so the faucet does come off but goes back on easily...and the mobile does come off easily...only the part that has the toys that hang from the mobile though but again goes back on easily...My kids love this toy...The plastic is very durable...Excellent buy..I Would highly recommend this item for the price..Its not real tall or overlysized...good enough for two girls or boys to play at.."
1,0,"It was a great pool, while it lasted.  Our dog stepped into it to get a drink and that was the end of it.  3 days.  If you don't have a dog, it would be a perfect pool for a toddler!"
1,0,"Young kids love the color (and of course, water, splashing, being outdoors!), the parents will love the various depths of the water in which they can of course control. It can also double as a play 'ball-pit' or better yet TRIPLE as some kind of 'sand tub' or your choice of texture (jello-shot pool any one? adults only, of course? ;) Speaking of which, it makes great for a good party for ADULTS when needed ADULT beverages need to stay cool; just be sure to line the insides with tarp so as not to accidentally rip a hole along the pool.It is a great size, and so far has yet to rip... I suppose I can see if I can 'update this' and note how long I have owned it prior to it ripping. Technically I would say it could comfortably hold four adults for lounging, and possibly four toddlers at best because of course the splashing/slipping/etc. ALWAYS KEEP A WATCH ON YOUR KIDS, not only due to the water (they can drown in like two inches--seriously!) but do not let the inflatable sides fool you--the BOTTOM is NOT inflatable.HENCE--READ THE DIRECTIONS. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. DO NOT PUT THIS ON A DECK OR HARD SURFACE. IT SHOULD BE PLACED ON A MILDLY SOFT AREA LIKE GRASS/YARD.LOVE IT. HIGHLY SUGGESTED. ESPECIALLY TO A SINGLE YOUNG MOM!!!!:)"
0,1,I got this pool and cannot believe how easy it was to set up.  It holds over 250 gallons of water.  I got it for an unbelievable price in my hometown.
1,0,"I had this type of pool when I was a kid.  It's great for little kids to be able to cool off, even adults can sit down in it to cool off.  These snapset pools are great because you can reuse them more than one year.  Just clean it and take it apart at the end of the season and set it back up the next year.  It can last even longer if you just replace the liner when necessary."
1,0,"I bought this for one of my granddaughters, and she absolutely loves it.  Actually everyone that comes to swim in my pool loves it.  Seemingly well made and definitely worth the price!"
0,1,"Well this was a disappointment.  My husband purchased the Intex Dolphin, it arrived quickly, we blew it up and it lasted just one day before it developed not one but two leaks.  With two leaks we figured it wasn't even worth trying to keep on top of this situation.So can't recommend this float.  It looked sturdy enough but couldn't survive being used by one 12 year old girl :(Pam T~(This product by Intex, which doesn't cost much more, was far superior -Intex River Run Tube)"
0,1,"This is HUGE! It is very back heavy as the front is high. More important...It is BLACK. In the hot sun, the orca turns into a dangerous animal, scalding to the touch and completely unusable. It is very well made however!"
0,1,I highly recommend this slide making kit!!!  It is fun and educational.  Our 6 yr old son received this for his birthday along with a microscope and our 10 yr old daughter constantly begs to use it! It is now number one on her Christmas wish list!  Great for all ages with lots of fun experiments to do as a family.
0,1,"My grandsons are home-schooled and this slide making kit has been a bonus in helping them explore their country woods, fields and ponds."
0,1,"Fun toy, well padded and durable.  The whole family plays.  It would be hard to get hurt with these.  Have not lost air yet in the weeks we have been playing."
0,1,"This painters tape worked great and had very little to no leakage. However, there were times that it was hard to remove and I had to use a razor blade to get it off. Aside from that it worked great."
0,1,"already taped off lots of small window panes to paint sash and it works really well,  You can even lift it back off and straighten it again, sticks well.  Would recommend this tape."
1,0,"Our family was lucky enough to win one of these in a competition.The kids (4 yo, 2yo girls and 10 month old boy) were so excited - the elder ones have been asking for a mower so they can help Dad with the lawns.  As is usual for Little Tikes it is of high quality and extremely durable.The design is simple but loads of fun - when you push it the wheels turning make the beads &quot;pop&quot; around - just like lawn clippings.  Another feature my kids love is the petrol cap so they can use their bowser to &quot;refuel&quot;.This has been pushed on grass, cement, pavers, tiles (indoor and out), carpet and floorboards and works a treat.  My 10 month old has even worked out how to hold onto it when he's in his walker and pushes it around as he walks in his walking (very funny!).  When he's not in is walker he likes to turn it upside down and play with wheels.We've only had it a few weeks and it's already a favourite.  Highly recommended."
0,1,"dd received around age 1.  Since she was just learning to walk, she did not get much use until a few months later, however now, she uses often (even at 2+ yrs old).PROS- Very durable- ""key"" turns and ""lever"" goes up and down for more ""just like dad's mower"" fun- Makes noises like a lawnmower - this is somewhat loud indoors, however when used outdoors it's the perfect loudness- Great height for older toddlers.- No detactable parts - that means nothing to lose !CONS- It's not intended to assist your child in learning how to walk... it's too light-weight and if child puts any kind of weight on the handles, they'll fall down.(this really isn't a con if you know this before buying)ALL IN ALL A GREAT TOY.  WE ALSO HAVE THE FISHER PRICE BUBBLE MOWER, WHICH HAS IT'S OWN ADVANTAGES, HOWEVER THIS IS INTENDED TO BE A NOISEMAKER AND FOR THAT PURPOSE IT'S GREAT .  WE PAID $9.99 BRAND NEW - A GREAT PRICE !"
0,1,"My son received this mower (well actually, the red and black version, but it's the same toy) for his first birthday, because we thought he might be able to use it as a walker. He could not. The base is much too light for a learning walker to practice with, so stick with a regular walker for that. He learned to walk incredible quickly, though, and a few weeks after his birthday, he was running through the house, &quot;mowing&quot; the living room. It is still (6 months later) one of his favorite toys, and he plays with it every day."
0,1,"My little boy likes to be a ""helper,"" which means he is underfoot constantly when doing housework. I bought him this vacuum so that he could ""help"" and I could still get things done. I think it's one of his favorite toys and has a pretty realistic vacuum sound when the button is pushed. When the button isn't pushed, it makes a kind of clicking sound when pushed back and forth. It has been very durable as it gets thrown into the toy box, drug around, stood on, dropped off the couch, tossed into the (empty/dry) bathtub and played with daily without any visible wear. The batteries seem to last a decent amount of time too. And yes, when you're out in the store and hear the little boy asking to go look at the vacumms, that's us!"
0,1,"Always wanting to &#34;help&#34; her mother clean, this vacuum cleaner looks like the real thing.  It was a hit at Christmas!"
0,1,"This toy has been in our house for over 3 1/2 years now and is still a big hit.  I don't feel like it is the sturdiest of toys but it does the job.  Shortly after we had this, the tiny balls stopped blowing around -- no big deal to my kids though.  My little helpers love turning it on and pushing it around the house whenever I pull out my vacuum.  My only complaint is that it doesn't really pick anything up!  Wouldn't that be a dream!For the price and the fact that you can interest them in any sort of housework is a plus in my book!  My philosopy is: ""start 'em early"" and this is a great way to begin."
0,1,These are very lightweight but seem durable as my two yr old twins use them daily and are not exactly dainty in their play! They love the sounds and the light that comes on. Worth every penny in my opinion.
0,1,"Perfect size for my 5 year old.  The standard size was just too big for him to get a good grip on and throw - too ackward.  This size is perfect for him to learn the baskeball basics like dribbling and shooting.  It arrived ready to go, we didn't have to pump any air into it.  Just out of the box, onto the court (well, back patio anyway)."
0,1,I purchased two of these junior size basketballs for my 5 year old twin grandsons.  They are just the right size for smaller guys.  The balls arrived very quickly and in good condition.
0,1,I love Mancala for 2 people and was excited to see it in a four person version. I have not had it long but the stones easily stay inside in with this simple magnetic closure.
0,1,"Mancala is one of the most popular board games in the world, and one of the oldest; game boards have been found in Egypt dating back to 1400 B.C. It's a relatively simple game that only requires counting, and it's very fun, for both kids and adults.Most Americans who are familiar with the game are only familiar with the two-player version, but throughout the world, people play mancala with three, four or even more people.  Why not try it for yourself with this board?The board itself is nicely crafted out of wood, and folds for super-easy storage.  Give it a try!  You'll be glad you did."
0,1,"I had an old original Ouija Board that was about twice as big as this one that my mother told me to, ""Get out of the house!"" when I was a teenager. A lot of people associate this board game with negative energies but I just think it's plain fun- especially at parties. It's fun to spook each other out. Whether or not your are actually ""connecting"" with the other side, I have no idea but I've never had any adverse affects because of its use. The only thing about this glow in the dark set that needs upgrading is the size and quality of the plugs you put on the bottom of the pointer. My original had felt bottoms for easier sliding across the board. This on just has rounded plastic pegs that don't move as smoothly and one does not want to stay in."
0,1,"I bought this for my 4 y/o triplets.  First, I am shocked this is for ages 4 and up.  I think it would be more fun for younger childen.  Although my kids liked it the first few times they played it....they quickly moved on to another toy.Second, I can't believe this toy had a seal on it, for some type of ""best toy"" award.  What is the value in this ""game?""  You press a tooth, the next player presses a tooth, etc, until it chomps on your hand.  Okay, so it's cute, thrilling for a bit...but it gets boring fast! I'm not kidding when I say the game is over in less than a minute.For my kids who love games, this is just so different.  They don't need to ""think"" about their next move, it's just pure chance that you'll get the wrong tooth.  I'm not one saying that all games/toys need be educational...some should be just pure fun...but this one just isn't.  The thrill was over the first few times of play.I'm boxing it up and returning it in it's original packing for something more challenging.  We LOVE games here, but this is a huge disappointment."
0,1,"I cut the straps off my changing pad, and I always just kept a hand on my daughter to make sure she didn't roll off.  Plus, we used the contoured changing pad so that helped a lot.  We bought a few of these covers and they've held up really well- and trust me they've been washed A LOT!  They clean up well, and the elastic works great, once the cover is on, it's not going anywhere!"
0,1,I do like this toy. It helps baby walk when they are just starting and they can ride it when they get older . It is also very durable. But for the price I would recomend buying a better one cause this is so plain.
1,0,"My youngest got this toy from Grandma for her first birthday. She was already walking very well and so it didn't really help her learn gross motor skills by helping her stand. She loved putting the balls down it and hearing the music.  Thank goodness it has two settings for the music and you can also turn it off if you like.The only thing I didn't like about it was first it was kind of a pain to put together.  It was easy to read the instructions, but it seemed like the pieces wouldn't fit together but they finally did.  The other thing I didn't like was how easy the balls go zipping out of the toy and disappear all over the living room.  Then when she wants to play with it you have to dig them out from where they ran under the couch.  Oh yeah!  The kittycat likes the balls too so that's another cause for the balls to disappear.  I would still reccommend this for the older infant who is about to become very mobile. I wish my girl had gotten this about six months sooner than when she did, cause she would have gotten more use out of it."
0,1,"I got this for my 1 year old because my husband is a police officer. He loves it, especially the sounds from the radio walkie talkie thing.  My 5 year also loves it, great choice by mommy!"
0,1,"I had a bit of a hard time assembling the top part into the car frame, but with help I got it done. My son loves this car! He loves all the sounds that the control makes and he loves sitting in it pretending to drive. We took it outside, it rolled nicely and he even fell over in it, and didnt get hurt, neither did the car."
0,1,This is a nice little swing.  Be sure though to supervise your child on the swing.  The quality is good.  DAME HILDA
0,1,"We got this for my son for christmas last year, and he dosen't even play with it anymore. And I agree with the other reviews, if I walk past this toy the stupid thing goes off, we are getting rid of it after this comming christmas"
0,1,"First off this toy is LOUD. There's no on/off switch so the only way to turn off the racecar sounds is to take the batteries out. I think that the racecar sounds are rather obnoxious, but my daughter likes them.It is very durable and once it was assembled, not one piece has broken off despite my 2 1/2 daughter's best efforts. :)However, ours goes off all the time for NO REASON AT ALL! Seriously, there's been plenty of nights I'd hear it across the house in my daughter's room continously making noise over and over sitting in her closet. Needless to say it now 'sleeps' in the garage when she's not playing with it.Other than that, it's a very popular toy with my daughter and the neighborhood kids. Even the 8 and 9 year olds across the street will play with it if she's playing with it outside. It's a simple concept, but maybe that's why it works.There also seems to be a few differences with our version and ones previously reviewed. Our two cars are red and green, driven by a Snoopy dog look-a-like. I haven't noticed either car being faster than the other, so maybe Fisher Price fixed that problem? Also, her normal Matchbox cars fit the track (the exceptions being the fancier Ford Expedition and other larger Matchbox cars which are too tall and bulky).We spent $9.99 for this at a Toys R Us store, so for that price I don't regret it, even if ours is slightly creepy."
0,1,"We bought this to replace a cheap no-name car racing toy my son got for his birthday - which promptly fell apart and caused lots of tears!, and we've been very happy with it. He is 2, and he's really into sending cars down these ""slides."" It's easy for him to work and compatible with most of the matchbox cars he has (though not the longer ones).The only complaint I have is the super annoying sounds it makes - we took the batteries out within a week, as there is no on/off button."
0,1,This toy was more trouble than it was worth trying to play with. My son and I spent more time unsticking the cars and various parts of the toy that we gave up and eventually kicked it to the curb........
0,1,"Fisher Price rarely disappoint, and this tea set is no exception. There is the usual set of four cups, four saucers, four  spoons and a tea pot, plus a milk jug and sugar bowl. What this adds is a little turntable (is it called a lazy susan?) in the middle of the tea tray on which the child can place the tea pot (or anything else they fancy spinning round!). They have also added a little mechanism in the tea pot lid which plays a little tune (The theme from Watch With Mother) when the button on the top is pressed and another to indicate that it is being tipped. This is really an excellent toy for all ages. Even after my nearly two year old has gone to bed I find myself making myself a sly cuppa just so I can hear the pouring noise!"
0,1,"My 11 month old son got this walker for Christmas. He is very tall for his age, and is able to reach the rail comfortably. He likes using this walker, but it does go a little fast, even with the ""catch"" wheel mechanism, so we will keep it on the carpet until he is walking better. The wooden sides come off easily (he can pull them off), so this is something to watch out for. Overall, we are pretty happy with it."
0,1,"For the money I hoped my first son would play with it, and did he ever!  Now the younger and the older one both play with it and it looks brand new!"
0,1,"I noticed some reviews from 2004 that were concerned about durability or parts breaking off.  I don't see the pegs that were mentioned.  Perhaps the issue was resolved by the manufacture.  We just love this wagon.  We've owned it for 7 months now.  My son learned to walk using it.  I had previously purchased another plastic toy that you can sit on or walk behind but it wasn't very steady and would tip over.  I'm so happy with this walker/wagon.  At this time we mostly use it as a toy box, but my son still plays with it carting toys around the room ect."

0,1,"I bought this for our 15 month old for Christmas and it's been a family favorite.  Young guest enjoy it as well.  Sturdy, and friendly looking."
0,1,"Thought my 2 year old would enjoy this a lot more than what she has.  It's cute and it does bounce, but she really isn't that thrilled about it.  Seems very durable though!"
0,1,"I bought this for my little guy who just turned 2 after seeing it at a friend's house.  He's had a blast with Rody.  I like that it's not loud and he tires himself out playing with it.  He will just sit on Rody like a chair to watch TV or bounce around on him.  He's also had his stuffed animals sitting on it & bounced them around.  Rody is a good design so that my son isn't wobbly on him and can sit comfortably with out me worrying that he's going to fall over.He's able to get off & on Rody by himself though he is a larger than average 2 year old (he wears a size 4 or 5).  It seems to be a very durable toy & was easy to inflate (I did buy the pump that the company who makes Rody sells, the reviews for the knock off pump were bad so I skipped that).  I also like that this is latex free so it's not an allergy issue for him.My older kids have been having a great time on him, too.  The weight limit is listed as up to 250 lbs & I believe it.  All my kids are very tall for their age (my 12 year old daughter is 5'11 and my 9 year old is 4'9) but they still fit on Rody and have been enjoying him as well.  Though now they are begging for Rody Max, the larger size. LOL"
0,1,"My 2-year old daughter loves jumping on this, but be sure this toy is used with supervision because she often would lean forward while jumping and basically fall on her face. Once a 2-year old does this, they want to do it over and over which is frustrating!I would very much recommend buying this, but just use extra caution when they jump on it."
0,1,"I first saw Rody at my friends house. She'd moved from Germany and brought Rody with her. I was really excited to find Rody in a local shop and discover that Rody is made in Italy, and that while the material used is the rather scary PVC, Lederplastic, the parent company, does not use any of the European 'banned phthalates' which surely means it has to be a notch better than traditional vinyl.So, we received Rody as a Christmas present for my almost-two-year-old, and it was love at first sight. And why not? This horse is ridiculously adorable. My daughter has taken to feeding Rody the felt lettuce leaves from her play kitchen. She rides him, drags him, cuddles him, and puts him in time out when he's been naughty. My 4-year old has to fight for a turn on Rody, but she seems to appreciate him a great deal as well, even if she is a little big for him and more frequently topples backwards. It may be that if we put more air in him, he'd be more appropriate for the older of our children, but since he's just right for our youngest we figured we'd leave him like he is.One of my fears in having Rody around was that with our hardwood floors and multiple fireplaces that it would be a head-injury risk, especially for my youngest. I thought he might have to be relegated to the outdoors where the soft ground would cushion their falls. However, they both seem to have a bit more control with him than I would have expected. They seem to anticipate the fall, and go with it, and it's kind of a slow-motion type affair where the impact wouldn't be bad even if they were careless. Of course, they've been a little more low-key than I would have anticipated too, so that adds to my feeling that the toy is generally safer for indoor use than I had initially estimated.This horse is quite durable. Rody is made of really, really thick heavy duty PVC. He seems more than adequately equipped to handle rough play indoors and out. He's easy to inflate too, we did so in a couple of minutes with a foot-operated pump. He comes with specific attachments that will work with any standard pump.I would have easily given Rody 5 stars, but I have to say despite the 'safer' vinyl he's made of he really, really stinks. Sometimes I smell him before I see him (my daughter hides him sometimes, though not effectively because the smell gives him away). I guess I expected that safer vinyl wouldn't have that sick-sweet plasticy smell that I so loathe. I'm really hoping that the smell dissipates after a while. In the meantime I give him 'fresh air breaks' on the porch when he's not being played with, hoping this will speed up the process.I do hope that the plastic he's made of is indeed safe(ish). I wouldn't get rid of him unless I was given a strong reason to suspect otherwise. He really is a loved toy, well-designed and a great source of indoor athletic play."
0,1,"We bought this for my daughter's first birthday, and I was a little dubious when I saw the warnings that said ""3 and up"" (the plug can be a choking hazard but we'd never leave our little girl alone with it). I was also not sure if she'd like it given her age. However, when we saw the way she lit up and almost obsessively bounce up and down on it we knew we made a good choice. She *loves* this toy! It's also a great way for her to strengthen her legs and learn balance too. She will need a little help getting on and off it for a while, but that's not a biggie. It's a pleasure to watch the joy she gets from bouncing on it, and it gives me fond memories of the hippity hop I had as a child. It's *very* thick and durable (it says it can hold up to 400 pounds!) and it can be inflated to ""grow"" with her so we expect to have it for a few years. Definitely well worth the $$$ we spent! :)"
1,0,"My little boy, who is two, really enjoys his Rody.  He bounces around the house on it and because it's nice and low to the ground, he does not get hurt if he gets &#34;bucked&#34; lol!  The only problem is that when we first got Rody, he STUNK like a really strong, rank plastic smell that would not quit for the longest time.  Happy to say that it's been about six months and Rody is now fresh as a daisy lol."
1,0,"My Daughter liked it, but hasn't really figured out how to truly bounce just yet. She will sit on it and bounce a little. I think as she gets older she will use it more."
0,1,"We bought a Rody for my 3-year-old's birthday after seeing her play with one time after time in the toy store. She adores it, as does her 5-year-old sister. The 5-year-old is definitely too big to really use it (although she tries--and has fallen off once or twice), and I think it's probably better for a 1 1/2 to 2-year-old if you want your investment to really last. All the same, my 5-year-old is begging me for one, too. The girls like to &#34;feed&#34; it and build it &#34;cages&#34; in addition to riding it. And it doesn't seem to have lost much air since we pumped it up a few months ago. Great toy!"
0,1,"My daughter received this from her grandmother last Christmas (almost a year ago). She was still pretty young then (about 9 months) but still loved to look at it and hug it. After a few months she really enjoyed riding on it, and still does very much. She just lights up when I help her on. She loves to kiss him, drag him around, snuggle him...even though he's not as snuggly as her plush animals. Quite cute. We've only had to blow him up twice--once initially, and another to make up for lost air. He's quite durable, and I know he'll last us a while, as our daughter is quite tall for her age and her feet still don't touch the ground. I have a feeling even when she can't ride him anymore she'll still be playing 'pretend' with the Rody."
1,0,"I am an Intensive Phonics Reading Teacher.I bought this toy for my grandson ""to grow"" with.He'll have fun rolling it around.  Later on, he'll be able to push the buttons and hear the letter sounds.THE BIGGEST THREE POSITIVES ABOUT THIS TOY:1)  It grows with the child.2)  It has two volume modes (with the louder mode -- you can actually hear the DISTINCTIVE letter sounds -- and that's something you can't hear on most other toys like this).3)  It has three ""play"" modes.  One for just the music, another for the names of the letters, and another for the letter sounds.PARENTS, if you buy this toy, HANG ON TO IT.  When your child is older(3 or 4 years old), put him/her up on your lap, press the buttons, and teach your child the letter sounds before he/she starts school.  Later on, write down the letters, and teach him/her to blend the sounds.  It will be one of the greatest gifts you can give your child."
0,1,"My 9 month-old daughter just received this as a Christmas gift- what a great toy!  Right now she just likes to spin it in it's base and watch the lights and listen to the music.  Later, we can flip the switch and she'll hear letter names and sounds.  Eventually, we'll take it out of the base and she can chase it around the floor.  I'm really impressed with this toy- if I had seen it earlier, Santa would have brought it-- luckily, my daughter's godfather brought it instead!"
0,1,"Got this as a gift.  I confess that I never would have bought it.  Surprisingly, my six month old loves it.  He can sit and spin the ball for 30 minutes with a grin from ear to ear.  Couldn't ask for more.  I'm sure that as he grows this will remain relevant for a while.  Till then, he's just happy spinning it around.I like the fact that it has so many songs, and a ""quiet"" mode.  So often these music toys make me want to jump out of my skin...but I actually find myself singing along to this one.I give it four stars because the alphabet voice is sort of annoying."
1,0,"We love this! He has had it for a year now, got it at age one and it is by far one of his favorite toys.  He loves taking it off the base and rolling it on the floor.  Yet another Leapfrog product we love!"
1,0,"My 18 month old son loves this toy. We also have the &quot;Learning Drum&quot; by Leap Frog, but he likes this ball better. He especially loves the classical music. I like the fact that it has automatic shutoff and will start again when it is spun, so he can start it himself."
0,1,"Lasts well, kids use it, and they learn from it."
0,1,"My 13 month old daughter received this toy for Christmas, and she loves it.  The bright colors and cheerful music really hold her attention.  Plus, the ball can be removed from its base and rolled around, all the while playing bright and fun music.  The construction is strong and durable to withstand rough play, and there is a volume control to raise or lower the volume.  The letters can be touched, and the sound of each letter is made.  I highly recommend this fun first toy.  It is very interactive and suppports early learning skills such as letters and sounds.  Buy this great educational toy for your child.  They will learn a lot from playing with it."
0,1,"My two year old daughter loves her discovery ball. After seeing it at Toys R Us, she talked about it for days. I finally decided to buy it, and boy is it worth the money! This is the first toy she plays with every day, and my four year old even plays with it once in a while. My son has rolled it down the stairs and my daughter drops it at least once a day, but it is still as good as new. We love all of the Leap Frog toys, but this one is definitely the best."
1,0,"My son received this on his first birthday and he just loves everything about it except for the bouncing part. It's a ball but apparently not for bouncing. Eventually he remembers it doesn't bounce so he'll move it any other way as long as it keeps singing and playing music. The alphabet buttons are great for the curious index finger. There are 3 different types of learning aids to choose from. You only learn the alphabets with this toy but it's really educational, especially when you're on the pronounciation mode. When you get tired of hearing the same voice singing the ABC's over and over, just change it to the music mode or lower the volume. Everyone in the household just loves it!"
0,1,"While the toy is &quot;Educational&quot; sings alphabet, and plays soft but catchy music not to annoying for parents, the base after time doesnt keep the ball secure.The ball is heavy, and will come apart after a fair amount of play.  When your child learns to THROW, you will want to hide this.  Its heavy and it hurts when it hits you.When the ball seperates as if you were changing batteries and it will, the plastic edges are a tad but sharp.I do not recommend this toy."
0,1,"So far we have had great luck with our My First Leap Pad.  We have experienced none of the durability or cartridge issues that others have mentioned.  However, I play with the toy with my son supervised, because he still is a bit young to operate it on his own (only 15 months old).  Maybe when he actually ""plays"" with it unsupervised it will be another story.I cannot rate this product any higher than a 3 because of three key flaws I find when operating it.  First, you must press the go button on each page in order to operate the corresponding games/story.  Even as an adult this can be tiresome to do each and every page, especially when you have a toddler who is very anxious to turn pages.  And you must touch EXACTLY on the green go circle, no margin for error on most books or you will get a completely different page.  Competitive products do not require touching a symbol at the start of pages, which is simplier to use.  The second downfall of this toy is that the pages are ""double sided"" on many of the books (or all the ones we own).  My son gets distracted by the page above and wants to see it or do that activity, so I must take the book out and turn it upside down, put it back in, and again press that darn green go circle.  Not an easy task.  They should have just made the books longer and blank on the back side.  The final downfall is that the books pages are difficult to change, there isnt enough finger room to grasp pages and turn.  This is also a huge problem with the standard LeapPad."
0,1,"My son is 3 and has both the regular leap pad and this one. I got him the regular one after being told by a sales person at toys R us that this one isn't as good for the money. She was wrong. The regular leap pad has some preschool materials but not the basics like writting, matching etc. I bought this one after being frustrated with him and the leap pad and seeing hte better material first hand from a friend. His attention span isn't long enough to sit and listen. We are both still frustrated. All in all I think it's a great toy but you need to look inside your child and see if s/he's ready to sit for something like this. On the other hand it might teach listening skills. We worked this into our bed time routine and he has to work with it for 10 minutes each night. I'm hoping that will encourage him to listen and learn from it rather than do it wrong on purpose to hear the silly 'error sound'."
0,1,"I purchased this for my 3-yr old son for christmas.  I was absolutely amazed at how fast he got the hang of touching the GO circle on each screen.  The sound quality is great.  So far, I am very impressed with this item."
0,1,"This toy is fun for a five year old, but it doesn't get any younger.  You two to four year old has to press a small green ""Go"" circle for every single two-sided page, then makes a musical sound letting you know the new page is on.  By the time the music ends your toddler will turn the page again.  A small toddler wants to look at the pictures and enjoy the story without having to ""look for the circle"" or ""find Edison"".  Your child does not even know who Edison is yet.  It looks like a lot of fun to an adult, but it is more of a gift to please the adult then it is to teach the child.If what you are looking for is an educational toy for a 2-4 year old, I recomend Fisher-Price:Learn Through Music.  It is PERFECT for that age group.  It only has four buttons and a touch screen.  The pages are behind a see-through case and a finger touch is always acurate (as My First Leap Pad is not always acurate to what is being touched).Please wait till your child is use to specific instructions on taking tests before you give them My First Leap Pad.  By then they are ready for the regular Leap Pad.  Instead, purchase LEARN THROUGH MUSIC.  I has the same concept of My First Leap Pad, but is gentler to little hands."
0,1,"We have purchased many musical toys for our 2 young children, and especially in the ones designed to be soothing crib toys we have often found the music to be loud, obnoxious, and sometimes out-of-tune. Not so with Baby Tad. If you place it on low volume, the six soft bedtime songs are very nicely done and very soothing to our 8-month-old baby as she settles down to go to sleep. It can be programmed at the press of a paw (do frogs have paws?) to play 6 minutes of lullabies. She is too little to push the buttons for the other activities, but it gives her something to grow into while she can still enjoy the music now. I only wish the ""Daytime"" song setting also allowed for continuouis play; it only plays 1 song at a time. Nonetheless, it is a very sweet toy. Our 2 1/2 year old loves it so I'm going to have to buy him one of his own! I didn't give higher marks for educational value because my 8-month-old is too little to use that feature, and by the time she can readily press the buttons that teach shapes and colors, she will probably have already learned these just as my toddler did. Still, a sweet toy and one of the nicer crib toys I've seen. be forewarned- Tad is BIG, much bigger than I expected! His features are a little alarming at first, but he's very likeable."
0,1,My son received this for his first birthday. He is now 2 and still plays with it. We are in the car a lot and this keeps him occupied for a long time.
0,1,"We bought this for our daughter when she was about 6 - 9 mos old.  At first all she could do was sit and listen to it. As she grew she learned to press the shapes and sing the songs.  She occasionally became frustrated because Tad would not play the song she wanted (he only plays the song of the correctly pressed shape).  Eventually she wore Tad out.At about 18 months old we put Tad in the garage (awaiting the next baby).  Tad was having problems occasionally he would get stuck on a song.  Endlessly looping through the lyrics.  This might be do to a low battery, but I have not checked.Either way this is a great toy for an infant to learn from."
0,1,I bought this many years ago. It's still being played with. I have handed this down and has been in 20 different families and still lasting. I recommend this. Babies love this drum.
0,1,"we have bought tons of Leap Frog toys for our baby and for the price, this is not a bad toy.  It is very durable and nice. it is fun for our son to play with for a short time, but never has held his attention for very long.  the discovery ball is, I think, a more engaging toy, but this one is still a fairly good choice.  just don't expect your baby to spend a lot of time with it and you won't be disappointed."
0,1,"My daughter got this toy when she was 14 months old.  I can't figure out why she gets bored with it so easily.  She won't pay attention to this toy for more than one minute.  It's great in concept, but didn't work for us.  My daughter is now 2 years old, and whenever I get this toy out, it still does not capture her attention."
0,1,"My husband and my son play with this toy. It's durable and has a nice volume switch, so it's not too annoying. This toy seems to keep my sons interest very well. It has what seems to be a lot of different things that it does at each setting. I like the memory game that it has to offer. I would recommend this toy to any parent."
1,0,"As another reviewer stated, yes, it is fun but the music does interfere with the learning of the numbers and letters. It is very sensitive and my 5 month old enjoys hitting it and making it make noise. he isn't too sure about why yet but he does like it. I do think they could have made the base a bit sturdier so it doesn't tip as easy as it does. All in all, it is a good toy for them to bang on. ""bang the drum everyone bang the drum"" (gosh is that annoying)"
1,0,"This drum has it all...it teaches letters, numbers, and rhythm in one great package. We have had it for about 8 months and it is still in great condition, even after tons of use (and more than a few bumps and bangs). Our 9 month old daughter is fascinated with the music and lights she can make by hitting the drum. Our 2.5 year old has become very good at tapping out various rhythms and enjoys the applause and feedback from the &quot;children&quot; inside the drum. I love the educational value and the fact that it is not annoying, since there are four separate play modes, so it is not too repetitive, as some electronic toys can be."
0,1,"My daughter was thrilled to receive this gift. She immediately went upstairs to fix her sick stuffed animals and her brothers.However,within 10 minutes of playing with this doctors kit the case top fell apart. The stethoscope does not fit my petite daughters ears and the heart monitor did not work. The head mirror does not fit on her head or even around her one year old baby brothers head. The blood pressure monitor does not stay together.We will be returning."
1,0,"Update on June 16, 2012: So practically 2 years later, this kit is still being used on an almost daily basis and has held up to this continuous play. Nothing broken etc. It has even made it into school for a show and tell :) Money so well spent! I can't find the info for it being PVC-free, but here's a link to HealthyStuff's product review that shows the product as being LOW in chemicals: [...]Original review posted July 29, 2009: Unlike the Fisher Price toy, this is PVC-free and has not been subject to recalls and lead poisoning. Fisher Price continues to use PVC in their toys, continues to do recalls, and I'm sick of them! Fortunately everything this company makes is PVC-free, and that really puts my mind at ease as a parent. I can't be worrying about whether or not I'm poisoning my kids with some toy. If you have not read about PVC, PLEASE DO SO ASAP!"
0,1,"This is a good buy consisting of Thomas track, a Thomas train, a bridge, and a water tower.1. The track is top notch, double sided, has grooves in the train track for extra grip, and is stamped with railroad ties.  There are not many strait pieces in this set and no switches.2. The Thomas is train is great quality.  I don't personally like Thomas so I sawed off the face part.  Fortunately the rivit holding the smoke stack on looks like a front light.  I gouged my train slightly but learned good technique for the future and colored it in with a marker.3. The bridge is too low for Chuggington, but the top lifts off so young engineers will not be frustrated.4.  The water tower is the best part, it raises and lowers as the spout is lowered.  Its real liquid not a plastic tube like on the Chuggington and Thomas fuel depots.  It has a magnetic connector track that is not needed."
0,1,Bought this for my 2 yr old grandson and he loves it.  He plays with it everyday.
1,0,"Tons of stuff come in this set, for a super price: a Thomas, cargo train with cargo piece, a tree, a Sir Topham Hat figure, two signs, a 3 section bridge, a water tower, and tracks that form a figure 8.If you add up the price of the red water tower, one train with attached cargo train, a bridge, and several track sets and accessories, you would be at a price 50-75% more than the cost of this excellent Thomas starter set.  This set is even worth it if you already have other pieces in the line.  My son wanted a water tower, and I figured why pay the price of a single one, when for a few dollars more, you get 2 trains, a bridge, signs, a figure, a tree, and tons of track.  While some of the larger Thomas sets don't really save you cash and can be very pricey, this one is probably the best value out there.One other note, the differences between the red and yellow tower are not just the color.  The red one, sold by itself, has the train track piece attached to it as one unit.  The yellow one in this set does not have a track attached, but comes with two little magnets in front, and there is one straight track piece that has the two magnets on the side, so you can make it stay put.  It may take a few minutes when you disassemble it, to find the right track piece with the magnet, and if you have a lot of track like we do, it can take several minutes!! In a way, it's better than the red one, in that you can place it where you want, even around a curve, by just using it alone.  On the downside, if you lose that magnetic piece of track, you won't get it to attach to anything anymore."
1,0,"I only came across this set while pricing the water tower on different websites, and knew it was the one. I was about to buy the track and the water tower seperately, which would be a huge waste of money.  I have compared the water towers, and I believe the $25 one is 1 piece and the color red...other than that it is identical to the one in the set when it comes to size and weight.I had set it up the other day to ""inspect"" it, to make sure it was really what I wanted to give ds.  The track set up is very easy and only takes a minute or two.  The tracks are double sided, which would make it easier for him.  Two of the tracks have a road print on them, and don't look like the other side at all, but I don't mind. The train also moved slowly across the track.  The track pieces do fit a little snug, which is a positive and negative.  It is good because I know it won't be easy for a piece to slide out of place, if it gets hit a few times, and it is harder for my son to take apart.  The negative is that I will have to put it together and take it apart because it will be hard for him to do those (it isn't a big deal at all).  It does come with a Thomas Engine...when I was reading up on this set, I couldn't find anywhere if it came with an engine.  I thought it just came with the boxcar (very pleased again). The box car that comes with it is plastic, not wood like the rest, it isn't a big deal to me, but it may be for others.I think the price for the set is VERY reasonable.  The water tower alone is $25 and the Thomas engine alone is $10.  The set comes with both for $40.  I like to think that the track set only cost $5, when the price is broken down to the individual items.Overall I am very satisfied with this train set.  I can't wait for ds to open it on his birthday.  I also can't wait to add on to it for Christmas.  It is a perfect first train set."
1,0,"I ordered this bus for my 2 yr. old who LOVES school buses. The pros of this toy are that it is pretty durable, it has taken quite a beating from my son but has held up really well. The school bus door can open and close and the stop sign comes out when you open the door. The cons are that the switch to open the door is VERY tiny and hard for him to open. I also did not like that it was a Pull back toy. He can not push it back and forth without it winding itself up and taking off and flying off the table. Also  the bus is super small, not at all like I was thinking because the title of the toy says ""Large"". Maybe I should have read the measurements I suppose! Overall this toy has held up very well but I dont think I would purchase it again"
0,1,"It appears in reading other reviews and looking at the pictures that Fisher Price has changed its' airport drastically.  We have the set that has sounds and lights and also has another car with an attachment.  I must confess, I find the sounds and lights to be the best part, as does my son.  He loves making the airplane ""take-off"", the helicopter ""whirl"", the taxi and the car ""rev"", the luggage carasel ""sing"", and the barricade tell him to ""stop, please pay the toll"", or ""go"".  It is a great toy, but is definitely worth looking for the sounds and lights version."
0,1,"I have the discovery version of this and found it strange that they changed it until I remembered a few things about my 2 year old's toy. First off, let me say the airport can be fun without the sounds and lights, which can be turned off on the one we have, basically turning it into this new model. (My son doesn't always turn it on to play with it). This newer one looks exactly like the older version minus one baggage car and no real landing lights on the runway.When we got it, we thought is was so cute and amazing at how the cars, plane, and helicopter would make noise just by rolling near it. but as time went on, I sometimes found the sounds annoying and it would malfunction occasionaly. It has an on/off switch on the bottom, but if you leave it in the on position, it can be turned on with the X landing  mark on top of the control tower (for kids to do it). And then over a few minutes will go into a sleep mode. Ok, that was great, but after awhile it wouldn't turn on and i'd have to flip it over and manually turn it on and off and on again to get it to work. This actually started just months after getting it. And now the vehicles don't always make the sounds when rolled over the landing strip and road. My son gets very frustrated sometimes. So I can only guess that they were having some  problems and complaints about the discovery sounds version. Hope this helps anyone out there who's disappointed that they can't find the first one."
0,1,"I bought three of these.  One would not hold air, but luckily PRIME lets me return for free.  They are good tubes, lasted all summer and nice color and the kids loved them."
0,1,This was a present for a 3 year old girl and she loved it and played with it for a year or two.
0,1,"The cups really do change colors.  I was surprised by how well they worked when I got this for my daughter.  The only thing is that you have to make sure the water really is ice cold.  I couldn't get it cold enough out of the tap so had to use water from the fridge, but that was no big deal to me.  My daughter has a lot of fun with this.  I wish it was a little more colorful or prettier but I don't really care.  I know the cups can't have lots of color because they do the changing thing, but I wish the plates or tray had some sort of a pattern or something.  All in all, this toy is great though."
0,1,"My 2 1/2 year old loves Calico Critters.  She especially loves the babies.  I bought this boxed set and every time she goes potty, she gets to pick something from the box.  She was especially excited that this baby bunny actually had clothes instead of just a diaper,and that it was pose able.  Comes with a lot of great little accessories for a baby nursery.  She is really excited about all the stuff that she can earn."
0,1,"My son received this for his first birthday.  He likes playing with it and immediately learned how to push the buttons both on the top of the bug and inside the shapes to get songs and ""learning fun.""  He isn't quite old enough to pull it around by himself yet, but likes it when I pull it around for him to chase after.  The bug is cute, as when it rolls, it wobbles to and fro.  The alphabet buttons on the top stand for different bugs keeping with the theme.  (D is for Dragonfly.)  The shapes are difficult to put in the slots and difficult to remove once in.  Fortunately they make up the bugs legs and I think eventually my son will have the dexterity to make that work. Until then, the buttons inside the shapes are very large and easy for his tiny fingers to push.What I find annoying about it is that this toy sort of pimps itself out.  If my son stops playing with it, the toy starts making comments like ""Wiggle, wiggle.  Play with me.""  (Uhm...sorry little bug.  The boy is off to something else now.  Attention spans on 12 month olds only last 15 minutes or so.)  I have to remember to go turn the thing off once my little one has discovered something else to play with for a while so as not to have the urge to throw it across the room."
0,1,"I love this toy!  I purchased this for my 8mo old for Christmas.  Of course I haven't given it to her yet, but I love to play with it myself!  The &quot;ABCD&quot; buttons each symbolize a particular insect (A=Ant B=Bee C=Cricket D=Dragonfly)- when these buttons are pushed during music play, they each play a particular sound that the insect would make. (I like the dragonfly sound).  I also like that the shapes are attached to the toy - I don't have to worry about them getting misplaced (or stepped on).  It gives you the option of either music or words.  I really like the voice on the toy - it isn't monotone like some toys. It actually has enthusiasm which makes it even more fun and the music is really upbeat!!  Thumbs up to VTech for another great toy!"
0,1,I purchased this product for my 4- and 6-year-olds and have been very happy with it. They love to count on it and make patterns.
0,1,Base separated from top 5 minutes after using. It went back in but still!
0,1,"my two years old still doesn't seem to show much interest of this, so it has been sitting in the closet for awhile, hopefully it will get to be used at the end.  material-wise, it felt ok, a bit cheap i think.  But for the price, i guess it is ok."
1,0,"I love gardening, but I live in a small apartment, with not so much as a balcony to plant anything on, so my ""garden"" consists of various small containers split between a shelf and a small table in my room (plus a small tree growing on my desk).  I also don't exactly have a lot of money to spend on gardening tools (hence the tiny apartment), so I was looking for something small and inexpensive to use with my miniature garden.  This set has worked perfectly.  The tools are just the right size for my little flower pots, and the set of three cost less than just one ""adult"" tool of similar quality that wouldn't have fit as well in my limited space anyway.  Despite being kid-sized, they are not too small for an adult (at least, a smallish woman) to use comfortable, although they're small enough that I'm pretty sure they 3-year-old I babysit would have no trouble with them either (at least, none related to the size of the tools -- he's not a huge fan of dirt, so there might be some other issues).  I'd recommend these for anyone looking for tools for small people or gardens!"
1,0,"I thought these would work in the sand at the beach.  Not so good for that,  but great for play in the garden. She loves to help Daddy."
0,1,"I love that these are wood and metal, instead of plastic.  They are well made and hold up well to kid abuse.  The only drawback is that if you leave them out in the rain for even a day or two, the handles get messed up and look almost moldy.  They really need another coat of sealer on the handles to be truly great for outdoor use."
0,1,"These are so cute, sturdy and durable! Great for the kids when gardering. I haven't seen any rust yet, and we haven't exactly been careful with them."
0,1,"The CS-20 is very cool.  20 Rounds on full auto.  What more fun could you ask for.Pros- fun, easy to use, oh and did I mention FUN!Con- Only two, it takes a while to reload... but it's worth it.  And mine had no darts in the package.  You could see where they shoudl have been but someone clearly tore them out before shipping.  Good thing I ordered extra darts.Currently Nerf only makes two air powered guns, they need to make more of them.  The all out battles in our office are awesome!"
0,1,The kids enjoyed used these and went in closets and dark rooms just to try them out. They used it for a long time. Great item.
0,1,"My son was a big fan of the song Wheels on the Bus when he was little. They would even sing it in Sunday School when he picked his favorite song! We loved this game, fun and alot of excitement for kids!"
0,1,The boys love watching fish and this railway car was just perfect. Bright blue color with fish of different colors. Look like fish bowl in a train. Good price
0,1,my son loved this! He loved that the cars light up and he was so excited to get it. It shipped and arrived so quick!
0,1,My son is all about fish so these were the obvious choice for extra cars for his wooden train. I've looked them over very well and I doubt he can ever break it. The plastic is very thick. They don't make any special sounds or do anything other then sit there with water and an animal. I love quiet toys.
1,0,Bought these for both of my grandsons.  Both love the water in there as well as the lights!  Great addition to their train sets!
1,0,I first became acquainted with this game at a neighborhood party. I purchased one for the family to play at our weekly get-togethers. It has become a staple.
1,0,"My daughter received this when she was 4 1/2.  Initially it is so much fun, even for the parent.  It has a really good section on the US States & human body that even taught me a few things.  But my daughter quickly grew bored of the 'book' that came with it as most of it was for an older child.  The book is a sampling of other leap pad books rather than an entire book.  I was under the impression that it actually came with multiple books rather than just a sample of books you buy separately.  It just seems like one big advertisement for buying the additional books.  So, if you do plan to buy it, make sure you can add to the system by getting more books.It really is quite an impressive machine & very portable.  & I do expect it to be well used once we get more books but for now, it is sitting in a cupboard."
0,1,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter, who at the time was just about to turn 3.  From day one she has loved it!  I can honestly say that she would not love learning as much as she does now if it weren't for the LeapPad!The purple and pink was a great idea from the manufacturer, she was barely interested in the green and blue.In addition to the LeapPad, the organizers and books make it a tight system.  It's very difficult to lose cartridges with the organizer.It's also very stable, it's been dropped, hanged (by the pen/cord), written on and RAINED ON and it's still working flawlessly.  The pages are laminated so they don't get damaged or torn either!Overall this is the BEST purchase I've made for my daughter yet.  If you want your child reading and doing math quickly and having fun while learning, GET THIS NOW!"
1,0,I've used this toy for two of my three kids and they both love winnie the pooh as much as I do. My daughter won't go to sleep without it. I like that it plays music for a couple of minutes so it can help her relax.  I also like that I can turn it on or off while I'm outside of her room.  She also learned how to turn it on by herself so she can here it whenever she wants.
0,1,My 18 month old loves this shopping cart.  She loves carting around her dolls and toys around the house.  This cart was super easy to assemble took about 15 minutes.  This is a durable cart and can be used in and outdoors for sure.
1,0,"I really did my homework when choosing a first shopping cart for my 2-year-old for Christmas this year.  I was initially turned-off by this one because it seemed so big and bulky when compared to others out there, but ultimately chose it for two reasons - 1) Little Tykes makes great, sturdy and virtually indestructable products, a major plus and 2) this cart has a place in the front for a baby doll to sit, just like my daughter gets to sit in the cart when she goes to the store with Mommy!  A very big deal indeed.It wasn't too bad to put together - ""Santa"" constructed it with not a single swear word!  It is very sturdy, and serves as a great storage bin for when my daughter is not using it.  Plus, it doesn't have any characters on it, which we find kind of a turn off.  Dora and Elmo are cute and certainly have their place, but we want something we can eventally pass on to a future child, girl or boy, should we ever have another.It's a great cart and all the time I spent reading user reviews turned out to be worth it."
0,1,"Bought this for my 1 year old but my 6 year old loves it as much, if not more. Both boys! They fuss and whine over it.  &#34;I had it first...&#34;  You know the drill....Something about putting things IN something that kids just love.  It's sturdy, perfect weight.  Not light like some of the others that fall over if you don't have the balance just right."
0,1,I bought this when my daughter was 16months and she loves it cause she has the foood sets to go with it. Shes acts like she is shopping and even putts her baby dolls in the front seat. The only thing that is if they try to put to much heavy stuff in the cart it will sometimes fall forward.Its very light wieght and duriable
1,0,"My parents bought this for my son at Christmas when they bought him his kitchen set. My son really likes it. He is 3 now and likes to take it shopping in his &#34;store&#34; along with his cash register. It's a perfect size for him and he likes to put his baby in there to take it shopping like when him and I go. The cart also fits a decent amount. You just can't throw a bunch of things in there that are big. It's sturdy and we've had no issues. The wheels also roll easily. The only downside is when I play with him and he wants to be the cashier in his store, I have to push the grocery cart which isn't so easy when you're 5'3&#34;. Oh well we have fun!!"
0,1,This shopping cart has been inside and outside and works great.  Wheels have come off a few times but you can just pop them back on.
0,1,"My almost-15 month old is going from furniture-cruising to walking. He's a tall boy (33"" at his 12 month appt. and I know he's grown since...) and most of the walking and sit-to-stand toys are too short for him. This cart is a perfect height for him, plus he can bring his ball, his monkey and the other toys that he like to tote around with him. I bought this based on another reviewers hint to fill with sand. This definately gives the cart more resistance which is great while he's building his confidence."
0,1,"My 2 yr. old grandson will push ANYTHING around the house.....trucks, stroller, cars, chairs!  We decided the grocery cart would be durable but plastic, so not to damage things that might get in the way.  He loves it, and circles the house unobstructedly.  It was a hit at his party.Thanks!"
0,1,"I really like this colorful shopping cart.  I already have another one in a different color that I liked so much, I decided to get this one.  I have since purchased more fake food and need 2 carts to hold the food.  The kids in my office love pushing the shopping cart and then playing with the fake food."
0,1,"Good smock for small children.  The ties and open sides made it easy to get on and off.  I love the pockets in the front, they make kids less likely to set paint covered brushes down in the house.  Covers the child enough to keep them clean but not so much as to restrict their movement or make them uncomfortable."
0,1,"I got this for my daughter who is 15 months old and while it protects her torso, it doesn't protect her arms so make sure you put an old shirt under."
0,1,Nice size and fit well.  Large for a toddler but covers all the clothes.  I would purchase this item again.
0,1,"A smock is essential for my son (3yrs) to have for his painting. This one is well priced. My only complaint is I wish it had sleeves, even chapped ones would help. The material is very thin. Wipes up fairly well but some of the &#34;washable&#34; paints have not come off of it."
0,1,I bought this for my grandchild and am so pleased with the purchase. These kids need to be familiar with old school toys and the fun they are. So happy. Nice quality item!
0,1,My kids have no interest in most toys that I loved from my childhood. And why should they with all the cool stuff out there these days? I bought my kids these as stocking stuffers and they played for hours! They enjoyed showing off their creations and being silly. Worth the price.
0,1,Loved this set of paint. All the colors we needed for our PWD cars were included. I wouldn't advise this for big car models but it definitely did the job for what we needed. Cheapest price we found after pricing around. Very pleased!
0,1,"This toy is a blast but, unfortunately like so many things today, the quality is very poor.  We bought this for our 4th of July picnic and it was super fun.  WE all enjoyed it from ages 5 to grandparents.  It soars and flies wonderfully.  However, the string didn't last as long as the picnic and we were left holding a pull-string toy with no more pull-string.  Really, how many brains does it take to realize that if you're manufacturing a toy reliant on a pull-string that the string needs to be strong and durable?We liked the toy so much we're going to try to fix the string.  But it would have been nice if it was made to work and last in the first place."
0,1,"After 3 minutes the yo-yo just spins in circles and can't even perform simple sleeps.  It either spins in circles when trying to go down, or stays in sleep for and won't come back up.  Definitely need to get a better quality yo-yo if you want to do anything with it.  At this point I can't even yo-yo without tricks and I haven't even used it for more than 5 minutes."
1,0,My son was begging for a yo-yo.  Duncan was the only brand I considered.  He loves it and it takes me back to my own childhood to see him play with this.
0,1,I bought this Yo Yo for my 10 year old niece for Christmas and she loved it!  It is a great yo yo for beginners to help teach them how to control thier hand/eye coordination!
1,0,"Our son at 11 months is too young for these. He tries to eat them, and the cardboard dye comes off in his mouth. But, we plan to keep them for later because I can see them being loads of fun. You do have to make the blocks when you first get them."
0,1,"I love these because they're light and when your child builds a tower and then Godzillas through it, it doesn't sound like your house is falling apart. Great for rainy day indoor play."
0,1,"This 15 Puzzle is one of the all time most popular puzzles--right up there with Rubik's Cube.I have loved puzzles of all kinds ever since I was a kid,over 70 years ago.The 15 Puzzle was probably my first puzzle and it has always challenged ,entertained and fascinated me .I have had many,many versions of it over the years.This one by Binary Arts/ThinkFun is one of my favorites for several reasons.It is extremely well made of metal,the tiles slide exceptionally well and do not fall out,and it is quite small,2 1/2"" X 2 1/2"" X 1/4"",and comes with a leatherette carrying case and even a tiny 14 page pamphlet that has a bit of information on the puzzle and 40 problems to solve.This pamphlet also fits in the carrying case.If you are interested in more information on this puzzle,I strongly suggest you get The 15 Puzzle Book"" by Jerry Slocum and Dic Sonneveld and/or ""The Famous 15 Puzzle"" a beautiful boxed set including a magnificent wooden puzzle and a book about the puzzle and the world wide craze it created in 1880,also by Slocum and Sonneveld.These two books are filled with all kinds of information,history,illustrations and details on solving various problems and arrangements.I have reviewed both of them."
0,1,"It is made of metal, but the squares do pop out easily, which it is probably supposed to do, but not great for younger kids."
0,1,This puzzle has a fantastic retro/classic look and feel about it.  This has held the attention of my 6 yr old son.  It comes with instructions or ideas on different ways to have the numbers sequenced.  This would be a great toy to bring out on a long flight or car ride.  Will keep them puzzled for hours!
0,1,"Bought for my granddaughters ""kitchen set"" & grocery store! They love them! I love them. Learning Resources makes the best play foods! They are very realistic looking and very well made. This comes with an assortment of veges & fruits. Don't think the whole basket is full though, like I did. There's a false bottom in it and the basket is about 1/2 full. But it is a well rounded selection of fruits & veges. They are good size too!"
0,1,but the adults took it over and had so much fun that it has become a tradition to play during the holidays when we are all together.
0,1,"This a fun little game.  Good for math skills.  Also good for ""don't give up"" attitude because several times one of my son's was losing but then other son rolled a roll that made him lose all of his points.My only complaint... the pigs have a dot on oneside (part of game).  Well that has rubbed off after less than a week.  No big deal - Sharpie to the rescue.  Also their is some darker pink paint on bottom of feet - that's rubbed off too."
0,1,"My 4yo loves play with this game. This is one of the few games that she can actual play more than one round. Usually we can only play games once and then we need to rest, this one she play and have fun for more than one, that it is really cool"
0,1,"I admit until this month I had never heard of Ravensburger games, so when I saw Funny Bunny my mind immediately thought of Easter. We have 3 small children in our house, so board games are a must for family night. Our kids often aren't a fan of some of the more classic kids games and don't find them very engaging. While this game was very easy to figure out for some reason our kids have been having a blast playing it. In an unusual twist they did not want to put it away when we were ready to be done playing, and came up with some of their own rules and kept playing until it was time for our bedtime routine.Well built, and a lot of fun for the kids, it is even educational on top of everything else. I know they will be getting it off the shelf quite often."
0,1,"I'm not sure why this has the age range 5-10 on it. There is no reading required, and not even number recognition. If your child can play CandyLand, they can play this. The game play is simple, though the instructions are a little lacking (are you supposed to use all 4 bunnies at once, or focus on one until it falls through and then start a new one until you either win or lose all 4 pieces?) The 5-year-old boy finds it mostly fun, though since anyone can pull the carrot cards and, thus, cause any player's bunny to fall through the hole, he has a harder time not getting upset than in other games where he only has setbacks based on his own actions. Otherwise, it's a reasonably fun game."
0,1,very cute game. my daughter loves it. she gets such a kick out of the bunnies falling through the holes. highly recommended.
0,1,"The premise is pretty simple - get a bunny to the top first. One picks a card, moves the allotted number of spaces (one or two) or twists the carrot (if a carrot card is chosen). Twisting the carrot causes holes in the hill to move, potentially plunging your bunny through the hole. It's very simple and makes a great first game for a preschooler. I would say the upper age limit on this game is about 5 or maybe 6.  My 4 year old likes it well enough. It's not her favorite, but it's a cute game for our collection. Ravensburger makes a lot of really great products, this isn't really their best. (Our family's favorite Ravensburger game isRavensburger Make N Break Junior - Children's Game.)"
1,0,I gave this game to my 6-year-old niece and she loves it! We have played Funny Bunny several times and she really enjoys trying to figure out the best place for her bunnies. It is a great rainy-day game. I definitely recommend it for kids 4-8. Entertaining little game!
0,1,"this is perfect for my 2 children, ages 1 1/2 and 3. it seems very safe and easy enough for them to operate on their own."
0,1,I got this when my son was almost 18 months old but he was afraid of it at that age so we put it away for a while.  Now he is 21 months old and we got it out again and he likes it.  We have a small condo so we keep it in pieces in the garage and bring it outside to play each day.  It's kind of a pain to carry the big pieces out all the time and then put them away after my son only plays with it for 10 minutes but I'm still happy that we got it.  The little car that is included is the best part because it rolls easily and my son enjoys just pushing it around everywhere even without the track.  I feel this set is very durable and will not be outgrown quickly so it is worth the price.  Just make sure you have enough space because it is 10 feet long and then the car will go at least another 10 feet after that so we had to use it outside even though I wanted it for indoors.  I would say you need 20 feet of space for it at least though.  I like that it comes apart easily and you can choose to put only one of the stairs on if you want it against a wall or have limited space.  You can also interchange some of the track pieces to make it shorter but we never do that.  I would say buy it if you have the space!
0,1,"My 15 month old and 3 1/2 year old play with this daily.  They love it.  They were fighting over it at first but it helped us reinforce sharing.  My 15 month old knows after it is her turn, her sister goes.  They run for this when they get home.  We have it set up inside and on our hardwood floors and they go pretty far.  I was surprised at how safe it was and my 15 month old is good at using with a little help from her sister and our supervision."
1,0,My 2 year old has this. It's loads of fun for him and was a breeze to put together as it just snaps right together. He plays with it everyday :)He also has it at his playgroup and all the kids there fight over it because it's so much fun haha
1,0,Kids really love this! They are really drawn to it. We have it outside but if you have enough space you could put it inside also. It's really cute and a lot of fun!
0,1,"I bought this for our almost 3-year-old granddaughter, and what a big hit it is!  It took her only a couple of rides to figure out she could push herself off without any help, and after a few more rides, she discovered it was also fun to push the car back up the track into place. The back wheels ""lock"" into shallow indents to keep the car from scooting away while she climbs on.  On flat ground, the car keeps going after it leaves the track, about as far as the length of the roller coaster itself. It is fun to see the big smiles on her face when she's riding.  This roller coaster seems very sturdy and child-friendly, and may be the most fun of any of her toys."
0,1,"We bought this for our children as a Christmas gift this past year.  My son was 3.5 years old and my daughter was 15 months old at the time.  The 15 month old was able to ride it without any problems.We had envisioned using it inside but you will need a lot of space to do that. The track itself is quite long and the cart needs extra space to ride after it comes off the track. After Santa came, we set it up in the hallway for a while (we have a small house).  The cart would go careening into the couch and we had to put pillows in front of it so the kids' falls would be broken.  We then stored it in the basement and took it upstairs for a change. Unless you have an enormous house you will not want this set up in your normal space. Luckily it is easy enough to put together and take apart.We now keep it outside and it holds up perfectly well.  We have it set up on a hill so the cart rides down the track and then down the hill.  It makes for a longer and more exciting ride.  I actually think it is better as an outside toy anyway, especially when set up near a hill.  It is kind of like summer sleigh riding.Both of them love it but, after the novelty wore off they use it more lightly.  The swing set is used far more heavily than this.My only gripe is that I wish two kids could fit on this instead of one.  I also kind of regret not buying the extreme one instead since we have this set up outside anyway and that one looks more exciting.  The downside of that one is that it would require a more permanent location since it is bigger and more laborious to move.  Also it is double the price (and size) so more is at stake if the novelty wears off and the kids don't use it much.All in all, this is a fun toy but don't expect your kids to use it all the time.  It takes up a great deal of space for something that is not used that often.  Nonetheless, it is a very exciting gift for a kid to get and it is fun when they have friends over for play dates."
0,1,"I'm so glad to see they are making this toy again.  I was trying to snag a used one for a while but the only one I found locally was missing one of the purple steps, and I couldn't get a replacement because they weren't making it for a while.My girls (4yo) love to play with this in the child care at the mall, but it was rationalized as a birthday gift for my newly 1yo.  At 14 months he is small and just barely starting to toddle but he is very happy on this.  We put him on and push him down the hill and he laughs.The girls have a blast on it, too.  They're pretty average in size for 4yos and fit but are about the upper end of useful size if that makes sense.  My 8yo can even ride but he looks ridiculous and does not have as much fun as he would if he fit.  (Not sure I want to spring for the giant outdoor one!)I'd say this is BEST for ages 1-4.  Get it young to get the most use out of it.Assembly is super duper easy - no tools, just snap together.  Everything comes ready to go, you don't even need to put stickers on.Dis-assembly is also easy, if you don't want to have it out all the time.The actual toy takes up ten feet and 2-3 inches past that but you will also want a good 5 feet of room to keep going - make sure you have the room if you plan to use this indoors.  A good 15 feet.  Probably more if you plan to use it on a hard floor.Simple, sturdy, no batteries, lots of fun."
0,1,"Jinx is a great game if you have just a few minutes and want to keep the kids busy. The good thing about it is there is absolutely no skill involved, all moves are decided by the roll of the dice, so my 5 kids ages 3-13 can play together and nobody has an advantage. It's definitely not a favorite in our house, but the kids do get it out about once a week."
0,1,"I got this for my toddler to use and she loves it. The pegs easily hammer down without being so loose that they won't stay in place. Overall, it seems to be a good quality product, so I'm happy with it."
0,1,"On the first day of normal use by my 2 yo, one of the sides boards fell off.  I had wood glue, so I fixed it--no problem.  Then, we realized that one of the dowels is too skinny because it just slips out as soon as you place it in the hole.  As a result, out toddler kept getting pretty annoyed.  But, as a whole, 7 out of 8 dowels work well, so I give this toy a 3 star.  It has been over 6 months, and our toddler still likes to play with it."
0,1,"I'm a big fan of Melissa and Doug toys for my baby, who is now a toddler. In general, Melissa and Doug makes educational, sturdy toys you can be confident and comfortable in giving your child.Unfortunately, my experience with the pound-a-peg was not so great. The first unit we bought we had the pegs ""lose"" their shape and start falling through the holes after just a few plays, and this is when our little one was >1, so not a real heavy-hitter. Melissa and Doug were very responsive and immediately sent us a new one, after a quick phone call to their customer service center (where you actually speak to a live person; kudos!).Unfortunately, we had the same problem with the second set, and then some. Not only did the pegs lose their pound-ability but the hammer also feel apart, repeatedly.All in all, I think Melissa and Doug make great products--and I continue to frequent them as a company--but this one just didn't seem to hold up."
0,1,"I purchased this for my daughter, I love the educational value.  However, my little girl played with it for short spurts, and it made me regret the expense of it.  I am aware that kids are fickle and one girls trash is another little girls treasure and for my tiny tot, her attention span just wasn't there for this toy.I do love this toy and could easily see how many kids would have endless fun with it."
0,1,"I bought this bus for my daughter when she was about 15 months old since she loves frogs and loves the ""Wheels on the Bus"" song.  I am so happy that I bought it for her.  She is now 20 months old, and I can honestly say that she knows almost all of the letters of the alphabet due to this toy.  She loves to press the letters, and can find the letters if you ask her to find them. The only downfall of the toy is that the driver's seat is the only seat that will make the frogs sing.  However, it doesn't keep my daughter from dancing when the frogs sing."
0,1,"These are really cool.  They stack to so if you have a few kids, they will really each need one but they will store easily.  Who doesn't want to make an awesome igloo???"
0,1,"This is a simple mold with a handle, but it is really great for building snow forts without freezing your hands off! My grandson loved it (age 9)."
1,0,"My daughter loved this oven.  She always wanted to bake something in the oven.  It helped her learn how to measure and bake cookies and cakes.  She liked it so much, she wanted to learn how to bake and cook from a young age; she became my kitchen helper."
0,1,"My 6-year-old loves this oven, and so do I!  The little cakes are  yummy and cute, if not gourmet quality, but is anyone really expecting that from something covered in pink stickers???  lol  Your child will be so proud to serve the family little snacks they made themselves.  This toy is totally fun, absorbing, and constructive, and I especially like how my dd cleans up her little utensils so carefully when she's done.  My dd has been able to do most things by herself with some coaching, so don't be scared off by the 8 yo age recommendation if your kids are a little younger.  The mixes are pricey, so I'm here today to get a cookbook that uses regular ingredients-- ""Mommy and Me: Recipes for Kid-Size Ovens.""  I can't wait to see how it goes.  Happy baking to all!"
0,1,"We bought this for my 3 year old son as a Christmas gift. Truthfully, it was more of an afterthought - almost like a stocking stuffer. We started playing it with him and we quickly found out how much fun it is. First off, there are no batteries needed and no loose pieces to get lost. We LOVE this!However the biggest reason we like it is that ANYONE can win this game, even my 3 year old son. Most, if not all, of the games we own require some sort of skill to play and win. Winning Crocodile Dentist is based on luck - all Joe has to do is push down on a tooth. So he has just as good of a chance of winning as does his big brother, mom, or dad.I HIGHLY recommend it for young ones - in particular if they have older siblings who seem to always 'win' at everything they do. I promise it will quickly become one of their favorites!"
0,1,We still play this on an average of at least 3 times a week. My son is 8 and still laughs so hard when it snaps shut on his hand.
0,1,I purchased this because it is what my daughter wanted for her baby.  It arrived in good time and in great shape.
0,1,"I saw this toy at my 2 year old son's pediatrician's office and thought it would be a great toy for my 6 month old daughter. But somehow, my 2 year old is the one that plays with it more often! He loves using all of the knobs to make the animals pop up. It's great for teaching colors and animal sounds. I'd say this toy is geared more towards the 12-18 month range because my son was bored with it after a few minutes. Can't wait til my daughter gets old enough to play with it."
0,1,We bought this for our son's 1st Birthday. He's quite the energetic guy so this really did little for him. At first he was curious how it worked and then lost all interest quickly after. Not a big loss though as it was cheap.
0,1,This toy is probably worth the money to add to your infants toy collection. I would say the peak is probably 16+ months for play. Not much use for the kids at 12 months (at least mine) but they did like it the older they got. I would say if you are looking for a good cheap present this is a good option.
1,0,"This is a cute toy.  It is a lot of fun for a few months, and then not so much.  I found it was hard to find the age that my son wasn't either too young, or too old for it.I would say he really got the most use out of it around 18-20 months maybe.  But, even then he would only play with it a few times a week.This is one of those old school ""must have"" kind of first kids toy, but nothing that really knocks your socks off.  At least it doesn't make a lot of noise. ;)"
0,1,"Did lots of research to buy a toy like this for my 7 months old and despite some of the reviews, settled on this one. Yes, his fingers got stuck there at the begining, but he finally figured it out. It would take him several minutes to do so, but after fews weeks, now he closes it in five seconds. And now, he is trying to figure out how the buttons work. Don't expect your baby to know this toy right away, but it is great to get your baby's attention and let him figure it out on his own."
0,1,I bought this for my 9 month old -- It is a little advanced for him.  He does like to push down the little &#34;pals&#34; after they are popped up (he can get a couple to pop-up on his own).  His two year old brothers enjoy playing with the toy more than him!`
0,1,"I recieved this for my shower. My daughter is almost 10 months old and she still plays with it. The music and lights are pretty. She does take the pieces out and throw them around, but she is a baby. Other parents were complaining about their kids doing that, but that is how they play. Whatever makes them happy. I highly recomend this toy to anyone."
1,0,"My 3-yr-old can't get enough of this game.  She's just learning about how to play games and has a hard time moving game pieces around a board, but Hisss is played on the floor with cards instead of little pieces at a table.  She can get up, move around, doesn't have to be so careful.  It's simply taking turns picking a card, and matching up colors, which she has a great time doing.  It's a wonderful first game, and has been fun for us to play."
0,1,"Bought this game for our 4 year old grandson's birthday.  Not only does he love but his parents found it so fun, they even play it without him - after he goes to bed.  They say it is a hoot for adults too."
0,1,"We got this game for our boys(just turned 3 and 8) for Christmas because we wanted a game that we could all play together! This game is relatively simple and teaches color matching and taking turns! Our kids absolutely love it....as do we! We have played it quite a few times and the boys have a lot of fun everytime we play! It is definitely a game to be played on the floor with lots of space! We enjoy playing it and spending time together! Our 3 year old picked it up really quickly and loves to congratulate whoever makes a snake! Yes, the game is simple but I think that is what makes it so much fun! Not everything needs to be complex to make kids happy! I do think it would be a great idea to purchase two sets like a few other reviewers recommended, so you can have more heads and tails to make more snakes! It's a very simple, exciting game for kids to play with parents or anybody else that loves a good game of fun!"
0,1,"I purchased this game on the clearance shelf at WalMart and was thrilled b/c it was sold out everywhere last Christmas when I wanted it. My 3 and 5 year old love it!  Big fun for the whole family to spread out on the floor and play together.  Every kid that comes to our house wants to play this.  Very simple, but colorful and a bit thought provoking for younger kids.  (I'd say age 7 would be the max for it - bored)  I'll take another reviewer's advice and buy another set of cards for bigger snakes!"
0,1,"My 2-year old son has loved this toy from day one.  I like that it can take 1 shape and turn it different directions on the same puzzle.  You can ""see the wheels turning"" while my son works on this.  Every child that comes to visit loves this toy as well.  It's a must-have and a great gift idea."
0,1,The children love playing with this.  i just wish i could afford to put a set in every classroom.  they are beautiful and durable.
0,1,"Gave this toy to a two-year-old for Christmas, and he seemed very pleased to get it.  He actually hugged it to himself, and he has been enjoying it a lot.  I would recommend it highly!"
0,1,"This puzzle is great for teaching shapes and reasoning skills. The wooden construction is very durable, and safe. Also loads of fun for children, who enjoy puzzles."
0,1,I bought this for my two year old and she loved it! But she finishes the whole box of puzzles in a few seconds. For older two's and up I'd maybe reccomend the next level of these that Melissa and Doug sell. I'll follow up with how it goes!
0,1,"My son got this for Christmas when he was about 10m old and he had little interest in it. We got it out again about 20months and he loved it! He figured it out with a little struggle and he still enjoys playing with it. There is a challenge to it matching the shapes as well as using hand/eye coordination. If the shapes of the pictures matched closer to the geometric shapes, then it would have more educational value. (ie. as can be seen on the photo with the fish- the tail is not triangular, but it could have been for the purpose of the toy, or could even have had 2 triangles.) Could have been thought out better.That said, it did give my LO an interest in geometric shapes and that is important.Pros:1. Well constructed and durable (our set did not have any odor: the 1-Star reviewers all complained of an odor, nor has it chipped)2. Colors are bright and appealing3. Educational: hand/eye coordination, shape matching, shape handling, shape sorting4. Box is great: shapes keeps each shape sorted.5. Fun. My LO plays with it probably 40mins in a week. Used it more when it was a challenge (daily).6. Shapes can be used independently or with other building blocks7. Shapes can be used for tracing (as a stencil)Cons:1. Shapes on boards do not necessarily resemble actual geometric shape2. Would not be challenging enough for a child over 3, so child probably wouldn't get more than a year of use out of it.I would recommend purchasing the Melissa & Doug Pattern Blocks (not Beginner), if your child is already 2 1/2 or older."
1,0,"I had one of these loungers when I lived near the ocean.  Our beach had a lagoon and it was fantastic to take one of these and just go out a float for a while.  I love the hole near the feet, it lets you dip your feet in the water while keeping the rest of you out of the water.  The armrests and back make this a very comfortable lounger too.  I'd recommend it for pool or beach use."
1,0,"We've bought this a couple times.  It fills up quick.  I put it up myself by placing plastic lawn chairs inside the pool walls while filling.  After there is an inch or so of water, I straighten the bottom as good as I can and let it fill up.  My kids love it for cooling off.  When they aren't around, it's nice for mom too."
0,1,"We purchased this Barbie for all of our daughters.  The dress is magnificent, she even has a beautiful celtic pin.  We have never collected Barbies but this one is for anyone of Irish descent, who does Irish Step Dancing or simply enjoys collecting Barbies from around the world.  If you haven't bought a Barbie, this is the one to start with."
0,1,"All i can say is that i cant say too much about this because i couldnt really use it. It didnt fit my radio flyer bike i bought for my daughter. It was in the suggestion box when i added her bike to my cart but it didnt attach. I had to rig it to make it fit but, my rig job seems to work and it does its job"
0,1,This is the first toy my baby has ever cried about when we tried to put it back on the toy shelf at Toys R Us.  He just cracks up at this thing.  I like all the different options there are and the legs are easy to opperate with a baby's gentle touch.
0,1,"This toy was a HUGE hit with my son (16 months). he loves the sounds it makes and the way the ""face"" on the lawn mower moves when he pushes it.  He loves to push it around the house.the toy is pretty simple. No assembly required, which is a nice change from most of the other toys he has.  The handle folds down for storage (also a plus).  When you push the mower, the top part which is painted with a face on it, moves back and forth like the mower is chewing the grass.  There is a voice that sounds a little like a drill sargeant, which says encouraging things about cutting the grass.Who knew such a simple toy would be such a hit?  My son runs for it first thing each day."
0,1,My mother in law got this for our daughter's first birthday.  Daddy's name is Mike so she thought this was just the cutest thing because of the name.  Well he lived in our closet for a week before being returned!  It scared the poop out of her!  It would start talking for no reason and the eyes would move around.  We honestly thought it was possessed.My husband got it out to check it out to see if he could figure out what was wrong with it and get her to play with it.  Well she finally would push it around but she kept going back to her Dusty (the vacuum) and leaving daddy to play with the mower.  They had been playing about three phrases worth when the thing burped!  Then I started to listen to it!  It says some of the grossest and rudest things I have ever heard come out of a toy!  We hated to be rude to grandma but we told her Mike the mower was going back tot he store!We bought the original Mike the Mower for my cousin's youngest child a few years back.  He was much more polite and cute!  So until the old Mike is back there's only room for one Mike in our family and that is daddy!
0,1,"Great toy.  My 20 month old son played with this for longer than I've ever seen him play with any one thing.  He really likes pulling it around, dumping it, stacking the blocks on the sides of the wagon or just on the floor and we practicing picking up our toys when he's done and that is even fun.  Sometimes he plays with it and picks up the blocks without me even prompting him to pick them up.  He did try to climb into the wagon and it is easy to tip over but he learned right away that wasn't fun and doesn't do it anymore. So if you watch for it and expect it I still think this is a great toy."
0,1,"I like this wagon because its so simple and fun for my daughter. She pulls the wagon around EVERYWHERE and even puts all her other toys in it, including dolls, and rides them around. My husband took the blocks out and put my daughter (29 months)in it and ran her up and down the hall! For [$$$] what a great buy."
1,0,This wagon was purchased when my daughter was 1. She continues to play with it two years later. It is durable beyond belief and the wagon is a nice bonus that she uses to cart around her dolls and stuffed animals. This is definitely a toddler must-have at a great price!
0,1,"My 28-month old received this for Christmas last year (when she was 17-months).  She loved it then and probably loves it even more now!  Mega Bloks are great anyway, because they're the perfect size for little toddler hands and easy to build with.  She really feels like she accomplishes something, and that's fun to watch!I can attest to the fact that the wagon is *very* durable.  My daughter is very TALL for her age and thus weighs over 30 pounds.  She will empty the wagon and SIT in it and want you to pull her back and forth.  It withstands this!  Granted, it's *NOT* made for that, and they will tell you so, but I dare you to try keeping her out of it!  Ha!  You do have to be careful if they climb in, because it will tip over if they stand the wrong way.  She's done this a time or two as well!  (with no injury)  At any rate, it's durable!She also likes the blue spaces on the rim to begin building off of.  They automatically feel like they're building something massive, because it starts out so high!  It's just a great toy all-around.I absolutely recommend it!(P.S. I read where someone said that it didn't come with enough blocks.  We also received a separate bag of blocks for Christmas, so I guess that could be a problem that I'm not aware of.  Fortunately, you can always buy more blocks!  The wagon is worth it.)"
1,0,"My 21 month-old son holds a reasonable interest in this playset, and he enjoys imitating the electronic animal sounds (which sound more like a human making animal sounds, but I think that's fun in a campy way).  The playset is colorful, comes with plenty of animals, is rugged and not too big.  My first complaint is that the animals do not fit in other Fisher-Price Little People playsets (my son really wants the zoo's polar bear to pilot the jet from the Fisher-Price airport).  My second complaint - and this is a major one - is that the product does not come with an ""off"" switch.  This means that those animal noises can get activated at the slightest touch - usually when my spouse is trying to sleep or talk on the phone.  TO ALL TOY MANUFACTURERS WHO INSIST ON DESIGNING THEIR TOYS TO MAKE NOISE: PLEASE INCLUDE A *(^#@!^% ""OFF"" SWITCH.  Thank you."
1,0,"My son got this for his first birthday and is now 2. He has always enjoyed this toy and is getting more use out of it now that he's older. Each animal area makes the sound of the animal that's suppose to go in there. The sounds for the lion and polar bear are a bit strange (you can tell it's a guy saying ""rarrr!""). My son like the bird's song the best and dances around to it. It's a great accessory to his little people collection and it goes well with the noah's ark animals."
0,1,"My son received this toy for Christmas when he was 1 year old.  He tried all the sounds immediately and by the time we heard the little blue bird for the 5th time, he was scared of the lion, Bear and Elephant sounds.  It is a very loud toy.  However all the ""scary"" stuff aside. My son who is now 2 1/2 tends to play with this a bit more now.  It's still loud and he still doesn't like the sounds that the lion and the bear make but he can accurately identify each animal and make his own sounds to correspond with them.  My main concern was that the zoo keeper was the first item ""lost"" and Fisher Price has no way of getting a replacement keeper.  That was the most appealing part to my son at first.  And I tend to wonder if there were more pieces lost could a parent get a replacement or would we have to replace the whole thing?It is a cute toy and I found that for just the animals my son was happy to play and cart them around the house...but as he gets older he tends to play a bit more with the toy as an additional part to his little people collection.I also find it harder and harder to add on to this set..the petting zoo or baby zoo animals are harder to find and the zoo train has been MIA on almost all toy sites and that was the most appealing addition."
1,0,"My 24 month old son loves everything Little People and this set is no exception. He hasn't stopped playing with it since we bought it - he even begged to take it to bed with him last night! His favorite thing to do is to put one of the animals in the back of the truck and drive it to the other side of the zoo.That said, I am disappointed with the moving parts. For example, the seal does not whiz down the slide, but tumbles off his platform to the ground. My son could care less about such things, though.Overall this is a great toy for imaginative play and must-have for your Little People collection."
0,1,"I bought this toy for my 18mo old son and he loves it! The music it plays is fun to listen to, and is loud enough to hear, but thankfully not loud enough to blast out all over the room. the trains detach as well, making it fun to play with one or all."
0,1,"I was very excited about this toy, thinking it was an excellent idea. Unfortunately, it hasn't really lived up to its price tag. The screen is way, way, way too hard for my 15 month old to make impressions on. I can draw on it; my 8-year-old son can draw on it, as well, but he has to be careful not to use his fingernails. The baby, though, for whom it was bought, can't make marks without a concentrated, sustained &quot;push&quot;, and he's a pretty rough little boy! He does enjoy pulling out/replacing the little shapes on the bottom, and he does enjoy pushing the musical note on the side to make music play. He also enjoys sitting/standing/running in place on it to make music (this is a VERY durable toy!). It isn't used to draw, though, which is a shame. I'm glad some families have gotten good use out of theirs, but I, personally, would have to tell anyone who asked to save their money for a more toddler-friendly toy. (Side note: My toy doesn't have the easel on the back, either, although it does have the hollowed-out, shaped space for one. Maybe they've stopped including it?)"
0,1,"My baby received this when she was 3 months old and too young to figure it out, but loved it when Mommy would make the lights and sounds go off.  She has now (at 10 months) figured out how to put the balls in the holes, and to push the button to make the noise and lights go on.  She hasn't used the hammer except to bonk herself, and me and the dog, in the head or to chew on.  The hammer really seems unnecessary, and she has more fun without it."
0,1,"My daughter received this gift last year at 7 months. She wasen't able to use the mallot that comes with it or push the balls down very well, but loved the music that plays whenever you get the ball through or push the nose. We lost some of the balls and called the company, who then sent us four additionals at their own expense."
1,0,Bought this arcade when my daughter was 6 mos. old.  She started out pushing the balls through with her hands.  She watched her 18 mo. old cousin use the hammer and she caught on.  She loves the lights and music and has continued to play with this toy several months later.  It's good for hand and eye coordination.
0,1,"We received this as a gift from grandma. I like that there is very little paint on the items as there are many rumors of lead in M&D; red paint. However, I found that the instruments, even in the hands of my gentle 18 month old began falling apart. The tambourine skin has nicks and tears in it after just two uses.My favorite piece is the cymbals which my little one walks around with often, she looks like a wind up monkey. However many of the other items have come apart, scratched or broken. The triangle is the sturdiest part of this set.I recommend this set only for older children, and even then the items might break quickly in their hands. If you want instruments for your loved one try to find a different product. We have already gotten rid of this set and it has only been 7 weeks since my little one got it."
1,0,"Very good quality product, but a bit disappointed in the overall performance for some reason. My two year old liked all of the products except the maracas (probably because they are very quiet - which isn't necessarily a bad thing) but she isn't really into the tiny symbols or wooden block (again both are not very loud). She does love the triangle so the entire band was worth it just to get the triangle."
0,1,"I bought this for my new 2 year old birthday to expose him to a vairety of instruments. First off Melissa and Doug products are a cheaper version of the competitor Box in a band instruments, but the instruments are not any lesser quality. My little boy is a little advanced and he took to EVERY instrument like they were the greatest toys ever !!! He could see you use an instriment once and he went to town using it. One after the other. The harmonica and bazooka both he learnedin a matter of seconds.  The toys are also fun for the adults. We enjoy them ourselves and they are teaching him to say words at 2 like maracas and tamborine..  I bought two different box in a band selections  and both are exceptional and decorative! I strongly suggest this as a gift to someone else's kids."
0,1,This Melissa and Doug toy was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She really likes music and I thought this would give her a variety of sounds to make.
0,1,"Arrived promptly, as pictured, no problems.  This looked like a fun toy for one of my little tot friends, and good learning experience too."
1,0,"I got this for my 5 year old in fondness of the wooden tool benches I had as a child in the 70s. The pieces are well-constructed and work well. Unfortunately, there is no bench, per se. You can attach the pieces along the tool box, but it's vertical and a somewhat difficult angle to work with. The handle is nice, but the pieces don't fit comfortably inside it, so there is some spillage. It's a good set, but the child has lost interest in it. I'd recommend spending a little more on a bigger and more ergonomic set."
0,1,"I bought this for my grandson when he was about 2 1/2.  I has been a total disappointment, even at age 3.Nails & hammer:  At first, he really enjoyed hammering in the 2 nails into the holes in the side of the toolbox. But an strong adult needs to pull the nails out.  I can't do it. He really hammers hard!Hammering the nails is the only part of the toy that he liked, but he lost interest.  Even at 3 yr. - I can't get him to play with it.Screws, washers, screwdriver & wrench:The holes in the side of the toolbox are TOO BIG for the screws.  The 6 screws are over 2"" long and there are washers that can be screwed on.  However, it is so much easier to use your fingers to fasten the washers, so the screwdriver isn't needed. And it is useless to try to use the wrench to unfasten them.*** A toddler cannot use the screwdriver while holding the washer in place all by himself. He doesn't have enough hands.I called Melissa & Doug, thinking I wasn't teaching him how to use the toy correctly.  The rep. said we should connect the brackets with the screws to make interesting designs or - I'm not sure what.  But I did try to show him.  No Fun!"
1,0,"I got this for my 18 month old son. The minute I opened it him and his 3 year old sister were fighting over it. I was surprised at how many things are in this. Melissa and Doug products are normally so expensive, I wasn't expecting too much. This came with a wrench, hammer, screwdriver, screws, nuts and bolts. The pieces are large enough that they can't be swallowed by a little one.My 18 month old can only hammer in the nails and screw in the bolts. He can't quite use the screwdriver, however he loves holding on to it and pretend he's fixing things around the house. The hammer is his favorite.My 36 month old girls has mastered all the tools and loves to sit and play with this set for 30 minutes or more at a time.I love the fact that everything conveniently fits inside the toolbox, so it's easy to clean up and the kids can take it along wherever they go.The box also comes with educational extension activities, which include learning colors. Love it!"
1,0,"Neat little toy, my son liked the hammer, especially. Could use more pieces that fit into eachother, like the side of the box."
0,1,"I bought this shape sorter for my daughter.  After only a few times playing with it, the paint started to chip off of the blocks.Very poorly made."
0,1,This is such a fun toy.  I love the quality of the toy. Love that it is wood. The kids love it also
0,1,"I mistakenly thought this was the same model my parents have for the grandkids.  Unfortunately it is a bit smaller and a lot less sturdy.There are 4 cutouts along the edge of the lid. Not only do they weaken the edge that fits on the sandbox, but they leave openings that allow moisture and insects to get inside even when it's perfectly aligned.The top fits on securely at first, but it easily warps if it's leaned up against something when the sandbox is in use.  After one summer's use, it's now hard to get the edges lined up with the border on the top of the sandbox.  We've already had a few instances where it popped off and rain got in it because a warped edge wasn't pulled over the lip.The larger model can easily be dropped on with one hand--this one requires a little work after a while.Overall it is a good sandbox, just be sure to lay the lid flat when in use (keep in mind that takes up a lot of space if you are dealing with a small area)."
0,1,"Haven't filled it with sand yet, but we have been using it as a pool until we get sand.  So far, it's a big hit with my 19 month old daughter.  She loves climbing in and out of it.I love how pretty it is and the size is perfect!  Plenty of room for her and then some!I love how lightweight it is - worried that the top might blow away in a storm, but that hasn't happened yet and we've had some severe, windy storms!!I was a disappointed that the top does not completely cover the sandbox - it does on top which is great, but on the sides of the narrower ends, there are two, 1 inch long by 1/2 inch tall slits that make it VERY easy for bugs,spiders, etc to get in.  Have already found several large spiders in it.  (We have TONS of spiders in our area though.)  We will just have to use the same stuff we use aroudn the rest of the yard and house for pest control in/around her sandbox though I was hoping not to use those for her sandbox.I am happy it has a lid though which will keep bird poo, stray cats, etc out of it.Truly awesome price ($58!!) especially with free super saver shipping!  You won't find a new one any cheaper anywhere!!!  Even the smaller lobster/turtle covered sandboxes at walmart are close to $50!This one looks fantastic in the yard, especially if you're not into the primary colors theme all the time!!"
1,0,"I bought this as a gift for my son's 1st birthday. I thought he would really have fun with it, but I honestly didn't think he would like it THIS much!I can't say enough good about this toy. It is made of such thick & sturdy plastic. I feel like I could it could survive generations of kids & endless abuse.There are 6 shapes & each one is filled with a rattle & all are different colors. The top & bottom of the cage twists off so you can pull the shapes out after dropping them in. They twist off very easily, but not easily enough for my son to do it by himself, which doesn't bother him. If someone is not there to unscrew the top for him he will just sit on it like a chair or carry/roll it around the room.He sincerely loves this toy.The shipping was very fast, I had this within days of ordering it. Tolo makes very high quality products. I highly recommend this! :)"
1,0,More fun than other shape sorters. The shapes are a great size for little hands. And they make noise when you shake them! My twins have enjoyed this toy from 6 months to 19 months.
1,0,"I was introduced to this game in high school.  I've enjoyed it ever since.  It's very fun.  Easy to learn/explain. And definitely produces a lot of laughs; especially if there are drinks involved.If you enjoy this, I definitely recommend Balderdash.  It's just as, if not more, fun."
1,0,My nephew is enjoyed it
1,0,"My son is 6 and loves playing games.  There are not a lot of games out there for his age group and intelligence level.  So many are babyish and too easy for him, and most of the rest are too hard, for teenagers and lots of reading.  This game is just perfect for him!  It's easy to see the different animals, easy words to read, and fun for him and us!  He can win, and we can win, so nobody gets bored or frustrated.  Definitely recommend!!!!"
0,1,This is a very nice addition to our game collection. Since we regularly play games with our children I'm always on the lookout for something we all will like. We've had this game for a few weeks now and the kids (girl 5 & boy 7) love it; request it often. It's one of the few kid's games that we parents enjoy as well. Great way to introduce the kids to strategy. So glad we found this one.
1,0,My 4 year old plays this with her 6 and 8 year old cousins and they all love it equally!
0,1,"This board game is similar to bingo except using cards for balls and animal pictures instead of numbers.  You are using 1 board, not multiple cards with numbers.  And instead of the middle position of the card is free, you now have four corners as free.  The game is for 2 players up to 4 players.  It is very easy to understand even for pre-schoolers. After explaining the rules, most of them can play the game outright. The only thing that is a bit harder to understand is the strategic part; but that comes in later as they play the game more and more.  They do enjoy playing the game identifying the cards and then placing the chip on the corresponding picture on the board.The object of the game is to connect four of your chips either horizontal, vertical or diagonal.  Fun and educational game. Quality of the material is OK."
0,1,"We got this for my then-5-year-old daughter for Christmas.  She LOVES this game, and she is learning to think ahead and make strategies for how to use her moves.  As an added bonus, my son (4) likes to play too, even though he doesn't understand the point of it.  (We'll get there!)  He has visual discrimination issues that we are working on developing, and this game is great for matching the cards in his hand with the squares on the board.But then, my 12-year-old daughter also likes to play it, and sometimes when the younger ones are in bed, we have our own tournaments.  :)I will say that I don't find this to be a great game for more than 2 people.  The board gets too crowded with tokens and it becomes too difficult to get 4 in a row.  We still play with all 4 of us sometimes, but it's definitely more fun when we keep it at 2 players."
0,1,"Very happy with this game, nd I am rarely totally happy with a product. Game is easy to pick up, and your strategies will develop over time. The card quality could be better. These cards will show use over time. Likewise, the paintings on the cards are a bit out--of-date and could be better. But I rarely look at the cards anyways and focus n the gameplay."
0,1,"There are plenty of reviews of this game, and really, I'm just piling on. I took this game for two months of remote camping with my wife, and we played it regularly.This game (for the totally unfamiliar) is a basic strategic game about making sequences of cards. The theme is that you're exploring, and each bit along the path you proceed is a larger numbered card. Pretty simple stuff, and really not very exciting, but kind of cute. The gameplay is simple: play or discard one card, then draw a new card, or one that has been discarded. What ends up happening, is that each card can either help you, hold you back from other cards you may want, or possibly help your opponent proceed.I know it's a pretty standard sounding card game, and it is at its core. But it works. There is a lovely balance of strategy (not exceedingly deep) and luck (in card draws) that keeps the game moving quickly while feeling pretty intense for a basic premise with only two people.My wife and I both like it because it is quick, not very difficult to learn or play, and enjoyable. We cannot play a ton of this game in one sitting, but for a few rounds over an hour, we're both pleased and we get to spend time together in a really enjoyable way."
1,0,"This is a great game to play w/ you wife.  There is a bit of math involved, and the theme is rather pasted on.  But it's surprisingly deep and has quite a bit of strategy.  Thou my wife would rate it below Jiapur and Takenoko; she still love this game"
0,1,Great introductory game to people unfamiliar with tile laying area control games. Every time you play the game is different. Must have for any gamer.
0,1,"This is a great game to introduce you to the world of gaming beyond board games likeHasbro The Game of Lifeand similar offerings.  If you are no longer satisfied with that genre or level of game, then I highly recommend Carcassone.Carcassone is a tile-laying game.  In this game players take turns drawing tiles at random and adding them to a growing medieval region called Carcassone.  After you add a tile to the game you can play one of your seven ""followers"" so that it becomes a robber, a farmer, a knight, a monk, etc.  You accumulate points as you complete towns you own, roads you control, monastaries you inhabit, and farms you have a farmer on.The only element of chance in this game is in the tiles you draw.  Once you have a tile in hand strategy comes into play.  Plus, with only 7 followers, you have to decide where and when to play them.You and up to 4 friends or family members can play at a time.  The game rules suggest that this game is for players ages 10 and up, but one of our children is 9 and she was able to pick up the rules and do just fine (with only a small bit of help here and there at first).All in all this is a solid game, the pices are durable, and should hold up for many, many playings.  The game plays fairly quickly, sometimes taking less than 30 mins to play.If you are just being introduced to gaming beyond Milton Bradley's traditional offerings you will probably consider this to be a 5-star game.  If, however, you are an experienced gamer that enjoys games at least as complex as theThe Settlers of Catanseries, this game will seem kind of simple - enjoyable, but simple.  For that reason I'm assigning only 4 stars overall for this game.Oh, it also plays well as a 2-player game!"
0,1,"I am glad that I bought this game.  It does not involve any money or any pen and paper (which is rather unusual!)  Scoring is done by moving people around a 50 point track, and if you lap it, you get a 50 point card in addition to whatever else you have on the point track.  This keeps the focus on the game-play, while still allowing for a point reference throughout the game.The pieces (and the box) are of high quality, and the game can be enjoyed by children as well as adults.Another reason I like this game is that two players can play this game alone, and sometimes it is hard to find games like that. You typically have two owners of a game and a third person (a friend?) who comes over and plays less often and is always at a disadvantage.Also, the game doesn't last too long. You are not going to get bogged down for hours, and you can ""get a game in"" before you go to bed, or before you go out.If you enjoy this game, there are some expansion sets to this game that you can also purchase.  They each add additional pieces and additional rules, and they change the strategy and make it more interesting (just when you might have been getting tired with the game!)They are the following:Carcassonne Inns & CathedralsCarcassonne Traders & BuildersCarcassonne The Princess and the DragonCarcassonne The TowerCarcassonne The River (sort of a mini-expansion)If, however, you think you would like to purchase them all at once, instead of one by one down the road, you can elect to purchase the ""Carcassonne: Big Box"" instead.  This contains the full original game as well all of the expansions listed above.  It is bundled together at a big discount, and as well as with a big space savings -no extra boxes lying around.In addition, if you enjoy Carcassonne, you can also purchase separate standalone games related to Carcassonne, but which are NOT expansions, and which cannot be played as part of the original game (or any of the expansions listed above).They are the following:Carcassonne Hunters & GatherersCarcassonne The CastleCarcassonne The CityCarcassonne The Ark of the CovenantFinally, for those who enjoyed this game, I must also recommend other strategy games from the manufacturer, Rio Grande Games.  I have also purchased the strategy card games ""Lost Cities"" and ""San Juan"" from this manufacturer, and have enjoyed them immensely as well!"
0,1,"I enjoyed my first playing of Carcassonne, and I enjoyed discovering its basic strategies (by my mistakes!). But I have not enjoyed any of my subsequent playings of Carcassonne, because...Ultimately Carcassonne is about guessing which parts of which range of tiles will grow in a timely enough manner to earn relatively more points. Different parts are worth different points, depending. And accumulating points means this game is largely about math (although there is more to it). The math is just counting and addition, but this type of math feels tedious to me. Some other people do enjoy this type of game.One fawning reviewer says Carcassonne is nice because -- ""there aren't long periods of boredom"". That is true for a few board games for groups (including the nice game BigBoggle), but in a 4 person game of Carcassonne you spend 3/4 of your time waiting. Carcassonne exacerbates this problem by needlessly not letting you have your one tile until it is finally your turn again, preventing the fun and speed-up from planning (this rule can be overridden by popular outcry).A fawning reviewer wrote that the ""farmers"" feature of Carcassonne is too much for younger players. He is right, because the farmers feature adds even more guesswork and math to count.It is funny that exposure to Settlers of Catan leads so many people to try/buy Carcassonne. The two games are not similar in any way, except that the game pieces are of higher quality than what other game companies market to us.Other commercial board games I enjoy include Khet, Quoridor, and Twixt; although they are for only 2 people, not groups."
0,1,"This is probably the game we play the most, because it is so quick to set up and start playing.It is quite easy/quick to teach others too.For such a simple game we find a lot of variation with it by changing the rules a bit.  Instead of just picking one card each turn, you can always have a card in your hand so you choose which to play.  More strategy this way - you can think ahead.  And this extra card can be shown to others or hidden.  And  you can have more than one card in your hand.The &#34;cards&#34; are well made as are the little guys."
0,1,We love this wonderful family game. Great for kids and adults alike. It can be played in one on one or team competition
0,1,"I think if I used this expansion more I'd like it.  The siege tiles are great for threatening cities and the cult tiles are a good way to challenge someone's attempt at earning Cloister points.  The creativity tiles I stayed away from because I know I'm not an artists and I wouldn't like tiles in the board that don't match perfectly with all the other tile artwork.  So I just leave those aside.  But if you want your own created tiles, then go for this set."
0,1,"This is the best rescue hero toy available. It seems to be the best made in terms of quality, and the kids played with it more than any other rescue heros toy. Kids visiting are always enthralled by it, too. I think it is a bit overpriced, but on the other hand, the kids do enjoy it."
1,0,This toy has a hypnotic effect on your little one. My only regret is that we didn't start using it until my daughter was about 4 mos. It is perfect when you need to distract your infant for just a few moments while you wash your hands or get bath supplies together. It will stop tears flowing instantly.  When she wakes up I hear her prattling with the toys (she hasn't learned how to start the music herself yet). She is now 6 mos and it still works like a charm. Definitely a crib toy worth purchasing.
0,1,"I loved this toy - but my daughter (4 months old) doesn't.  She is not very interested in it, and cries at the sound of many of the songs.  Maybe when she is older she will like it more?  I liked the visuals and the bubbles, but it does not hold or attract her attention at this age!"
0,1,"My son loves this toy, and it was great when he was little.  However, at 6 months old he actually found a way to unhook this toy from the side of the crib!  I walked in to find it on top of him and he was chewing on the strap!  Things could have been much worse, but as a warning to parents:  take this toy out of the crib before your child reaches 6 months.  I still rate this toy 5 stars for fun though...the music is VERY soothing and the swimming fish kept his attention in the morning so we could get a few more minutes of sleep."
0,1,"This is a cute toy, nice music and interesting to infants.  However, it eats batteries like candy, so be prepared with lots of recharables!"
0,1,"She has had it since she was 2 weeks old and has been enamoured by it from day one.She loves to lay on her side and watch the fish swim around to the music and soothing lights.  She likes it so much that she begins crying immediately when the thing shuts off.  She will lay in her crib, contently watching the show until it's over.  I love the music and the sounds are so calming to her.This is toy is great and just what I need to steal a few moment's peace."
1,0,"I had the older version for my daughter, who is now 4 1/2, and when I went to use it for my 3 month old son I realized that I had left the batteries in it and they exploded, ruining the aquarium.  I was very happy to find that Fisher Price still had the aquariums on the market and that they were ""updated"" from 4 years ago. We got this model for our 3 month old son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it.  He loves it with the lights, bubbles and music all going at once.  When we took it out of the package and turned it on for him, he stared at it for 20 minutes.  I recommend this to anybody with an infant!!"
1,0,"I received this toy for my daughter's baby shower.  It has been in her crib since birth, but didn't get any use until she was about four months old.  Until she was four months when she would wake up in the mornings she would immediately cry until we would come to get her.  One morning when I was getting ready for work I heard music coming from her monitor.  She had figured out how to turn on the music!  Since she has figured it out she now keeps herself entertained until we can get to her in the mornings.  Also, we hear her playing it in the middle of the night sometimes.  It has been a great way for me and my husband to get the extra sleep we need.  I have been thrilled that she has found a way to entertain herself!  Now I don't have to worry about having enough time to get ready for work, because she plays the music, it gives me that extra 15 minutes to finish getting ready in the morning.  I would highly recommend this to anyone!"
0,1,Our daughter just loves this and so do we. At 22mo we still have it in the crib...and debated taking it out...but she still listens and plays with it so we will just leave it.  Great Gift!!!  You will be nothing but pleased with this.
0,1,"I have the planet aquarium (older version) of this.  My 3 and 1/2 year old loved this toy when he was a baby and would fall asleep as soon as we turned it on.  With my 6 month old, I think he loves it even more.  I put him in his crib every night and even though he may not be sleepy, all I have to do is turn this on and he is asleep within minutes.  He loves to see the fish ""swim"" and hear the music.  He is also enlighten by the lights.  This is a must-have for a crib."
0,1,I bought this as a gift for my 9 month old niece this past Christmas-it was soooooo adorable-the sounds-the soothing music and water waves were adorable-my niece could not get enough of it-everyone elses gifts were tossed aside. Totally recommended!!!!
0,1,"Santa brought this toy for my nine month old daughter, and she loves it, and so do I!  The small balls are the right size for her to hold on to (one in each hand banging them together, usually!) and the music is soft &amp; pleasant.  My daughter is at the perfect age for this toy- she's just figuring out how to put and take, and she loves watching the balls roll around inside the bowl.  I highly recommend this toy!"
0,1,"My daughter enjoyed the Ocean Wonders Aquarium in her crib so I decided to get the fish bowl for her to play with in her play yard. She was almost 6 months old and just starting to sit unassisted. The fishbowl was just the right size. It gave her something to hold onto and play with while sitting. After only a couple of days she was sitting for longer periods without falling over. First she was more interested in rocking the bowl and flipping it over to spill the balls out. At 7 months she started rolling the balls and we could pass them back and forth on the floor. I've made a game of trying to make the fish and the sea shell spin inside the flutter balls. I enjoy playing with this toy as much as the baby does. I like to spin the bowl around clockwise to shake the glitter up and make the fish swim by. When I first saw this toy I thought it was only good for was practicing hand-eye coordination by taking the balls out and putting them back in, but there's so much more to it. It lights up and plays cute little water sound effects and music, but even when it's turned off it's still pretty exciting (which is good since my daughter likes to flip it over and turn off the switch on the bottom.) Imaginative minds can find many different ways to play with this toy so it's definitely one children can enjoy for years to come."
0,1,"This toy was great when dd was learning how to control her hands.  The whole that you drop the balls into was large enough that she didn't have troubles &quot;missing&quot;.  The balls where just the right size for little hands to hold on to.It is extremely durable - dd dropped the entire fish bowl several times and the balls have been dropped, kicked, stepped on and who knows what else - they all still work just like the day we opened the box.  Even though dd is now 20 months old she ocassionally still pulls this toy out to hear the fun music and see what other treasures she can insert into the bowl.  Also, we like the volume feature.She didn't seem to pay much attention to the &quot;floating/spinning&quot; items inside the translucent balls.  Also we would bring this along to grandma &amp; grandpa's house frequently - and since they have a dog, we found it difficult to easily get all the dog hair out of the fishbowl.  And finally we wish that it played a few more toons.  The one song it does play is definitely upbeat and doesn't seem to get annoying as quickly as a lot of the toys out there.A great toy to have!"
1,0,"I bought the fishbowl for my son at Christmas last year (he was about 6 months old). He didn't quite know what to do with it at first, and his hands were a little small to grab the balls well. But he loved to look and bat at the bowl, and the sound/lights got his attention. As he has grown, this has become one of his favorite toys and still is at nearly 1 1/2 years old. He loves taking the balls out and putting them back in. Another favorite activity is watching the spinners inside the balls as they roll across the kitchen floor."
0,1,We bought this as a Christmas gift for our then three month old baby. at first she would only sit and look at it but now three months or so later she has learned to dump out the flutter balls and she rolls the fishbowl around on the floor. The music plays after a ball is dropped into the bowl and there are two settings for the volume which is nice. The fish &quot;swim&quot; around the bowl and lights and music play giving the baby cause and effect lessons.I think that this item is a bit overpriced but do not regret the purchase.
0,1,"My 4yr old son wanted to get this for his 5 month old brother, He watched a commercial on this. So, we got it for his baby brother for Christmas. This is the cutiest little toy.  The baby just laughs when he sees it.  Pooh is cute how he shakes."
0,1,"This will be a birthday gift for my granddaughter but I opened it to make sure everything was ok, and I know she is going to love playing with this.  She'll be 2 in January, and she's into role playing, so this item is perfect.  She also loves animals and these are a perfect size for a 2 year old (and older).  This set normally sells separately, but together it's a terrific price, plus I got free shipping when I ordered this.  These animals are really adorable and pretending is such a wonderful part of a childs development. I definitely recommend this to all parents and grandparents."
0,1,"My parents had bought this for my son for Christmas and he just loves it. Before we received this he only had the water tower figure 8 set, and with me just playing around with the tracks one day I was able to get this to fit in perfectly, with no leftover track pieces.My son thought the only way to make noise was by pushing the button, but then I showed him that the train and ambulance can trigger the noise too.  Since then he can't put it down, and most nights he falls asleep with it.  Luckily there is an off switch underneath."
0,1,Thomas and Friends cost a premium and if you have a train mad child you really need lots of track.  Getting enough to make a really good track is difficult if you have to pay this much and haven't won the lottery but these are worth the extra money.  They are perfect for getting track to join when they are just a bit off.  They do curve sharply if you need it but we find that sharp curves make for lots of derailing and frustration but that seems to be the case with all sharp curves so it isn't just these tracks.  We have four and they do make a great addition to the layouts we do (I have a five year old) and he now can do much of the building himself.
1,0,"We got this track on a great deal, and we couldn't be happier. Thomas track is by far some of the most durable track that we can find. It is expensive, but Amazon has great deals to be found. This will last for years to come."
0,1,"Bought for granddaughters to play ""store"".  Dissappointed with set because the ""credit card"" is just a piece of plastic with nothing on it-can't tell that it's the CC. Signs are just pieces of laminated paper; some of groceries are only small cardboard boxes and there are very little groceries in the set. The best part for my girls was the apron! They loved the apron! Overall, it's cute but the only thing in it worth anything was the apron!"
1,0,"This is a great toy. My very active five year old loves this game. He can play and move and review his numbers and adding and subtracting.Two comments about this math mat though-1. The numbers face outwards and the child stands in the middle of the numbers. When my son first started playing on this it took him some time to figure out which numbers were which. The numbers need to face the child.2. The restart button is on the inside of the circle where the child stands and is easily stepped on. This leads to frustration sometimes if the child is not careful because they step on this restart button and the game starts over.Otherwise, this is an excellent way to review number recognition, adding and subtracting.Enjoy. Well worth the money."
0,1,"My 3 year old is obsessed with numbers. Even though I know that he is probably just memorizing at this point, he is constantly asking to ""do addition"" and ""do subtraction"" with me. He still has some difficulty listening to instructions, so he often doesn't do the games beyond simple counting correct because he just gets so excited by this toy. If you have a child who is interested in numbers, this is for you!"
0,1,My two year old still loves to play pretend and it is a good educational tool.  It taugh thim how to use a spoon and fork!!!
0,1,"So my 17-month old is always underfoot in the kitchen, and keeps playing with the tupperware.  She's beginning to show the emergence of pretend play, so I thought that this would be a nice kitchen set that she could grown in to as she gets older.  Boy, this set really does have everything ""except the sink""!  Everything's packaged separately in the box it comes in, so nothing's loose and rattling around.  The bright primary colors immediately attracted my little one.  The set is marked ""ages 3+"" and I can see why -- there are small pieces, like the cookie cutters, and some of the saucers (for the teacups, I guess) are the size of Chips Ahoy cookies.  Needless to say, I'll be storing those pieces away until she's older...and wants more pieces for her pretend play.  She especially likes the tea kettle and the saucepan -- I think the handles are the attraction -- they're just right for her little hands.  I also like that the set it easy to clean....I'm not sure if it's dishwasher safe, but I just hand wash them, it doesn't take a lot of time.  Some of the cups survived a short drop from the kitchen table (she was playing before dinner was served) and no scratches or cracks on the toy or our hardwood floor.  I read other reviews that said this set is too expensive for what you get, and it's cheaply made, but I have to disagree.  The pots are a little on the small side to fit some of the play food she already has, but that's a minor thing -- we can adjust to that (and it'll be good for her problem-solving skills and spatial development).  I think it's a great buy, and even if it doesn't contain any play food, it helps her develop her imagination (and she's mimicking what I do in the kitchen), and keeps her busy where I can keep an eye on her as I cook.  I think it's a great buy!"
0,1,Lots of dishes for a small price and yes they are small but that is why they fit in the cupboards of so many of the play sets. I bought to go with the Step 2 Party Kitchen and they fit in the cupboard. None of them have broken or cracked  yet so I would say durable too.
0,1,I thought this was a little over priced but once it comes and you see the quality of the items received it seems like a better deal. Some of the items work so well that we use them in the actual kitchen for the kids tools. The tea pot with the working pour spout and the utensils with moving parts like the ice cream scoop are a huge hit. If I had one negative to say it would be that the ice cream cups come with a removable base which I am always having to put back on.
0,1,"This is an excellent toy that allows a child to learn with or without a parent helping out.  My son (3 yrs old) has four books for this unit and they all read and count accurately and our unit has never frozen up on us.  My favorite thing about this toy - NO GREEN GO CIRCLE!  I'm sorry, but reminding my son to ""press the green go circle"" every time he turned a page on his LeapPad jr was seriously annoying.  The PowerTouch, on the other hand, knows what page you are on automatically.  Also, there is no stylus to worry about, the child simply presses words and pictures with his/her finger.  This product is far superior to the LeapPads.Another thing I like about this system is the multitude of activities.  There are multiple counting, phonics, and game activities on almost every page.  Also, when the system does not have a book in it, there is an alphabet with activities built right into the system.The unit has an easy on/off switch in the front that is easy for kids and a master on/off reset switch in the back.  It is easy for kiddos to open and close and use without help, so mom can have a bit of a rest (thank you Fisher Price!!)."
1,0,"I bought this two years ago for my then 4 year old daughter. We chose it over leap pad because it didn't require the stylus, just the child's finger. She has spent countless hours with it and has learned an amazing amount from it. She still uses it almost daily. I am now using ebay to find additional books for her. I wish fisher price had stuck with this great product. Unfortunately, (just as many years ago we chose sega over nintendo!!) we went with the product that lost out in the marketplace. Everyone seems to have gone with leap pad. So while I think this product is excellent, it doesn't seem to be a good choice currently unles FP chooses to make more books."
0,1,"We just bought this for my 2-year-old daughter for her birthday after having played with the display at Target over and over again. Her first response was ""WOW!"". This book is a big improvement over the LeapPad systems as it allows your child to use his/her finger to guide them rather than a pen.  It is definitely more user-friendly for the younger kids because they do not need to touch the ""go"" circle to make the book work; a concept good for the older kids only.  It comes with 2 books to get started: A Sesame Street book and a k-2 grade learning guide.  If fisher price can get their power touch library expanded to include more titles sooner rather than later, it will give Leappad a run for its money."
0,1,My son got this toy for his second birthday last October and really loves it.  I guess it is similar to the Leap Pad but since I've never seen the leap Pad I'm not sure.  The board basically fits storybooks on it along with a cartridge that accompanies each book.  Kids turn the page and the interactive story book plays and responds to your childs touch.  They can press on basically everything on each page and hear a sound or phrase and even play simple number and color games.  The voices are right out of Sesame Street for the book that comes with the set.It's quite easy for kids to turn on and use all by themselves.  The toy is quite durable and is not a battery hog.  I know that there are many more story books out for the Leap Pad. Hopefully Fisher Price will continue to support the toy with more and more story books because it is a very well made toy.  VEry educational and fun for kids.
0,1,"When I ordered this item, I thought it would be durable, at least. The instant I removed it from the packaging, I could tell that the entire thing, the base as well as the upper area that houses the frog, including the lid, was made of the kind of thin, disposable plastic that holds a doll in place in a package. No kidding. If you push in with your finger, it gives in. I was amazed that it even held water. The cave is tiny, maybe for a just-grown froglet. We needed something asap for a frog my son caught in a pond and I GUESS this is better than a sand bucket with a plate on top, but just barely. What is funny is that the feeding hole at the top has a plastic cap that is inset and you remove the cap to put in live bugs. That cap is made of a heavier, stronger type of plastic than the entire container. I really feel ripped off by this product and I am surprised at Uncle Milton. I should have gotten the Discovery Kids Frog Habitat, which we have had in the past and was made of regular heavy plastic, like a fish tank. The only reason I didn't get that again is because it has crevices that are impossible to clean and make the whole thing smell badly. At least it was not made of lightweight, disposable plastic casing. I do not have experience with ordering tadpoles because we caught our frog. When I put the lid back on this tank, I push the sides in so that the sides will conform to the shape of the lid, that's how flimsy it is. I would not recommend this product to anyone nor would I buy it if I had seen it in person to see how lightweight and flimsy the plastic is. The entire product is really, really just the thickness of one of those heavy-duty Solo brand beer cups, no kidding."
0,1,"I bought this for my 4 year old Grandson for Christmas. The tadpoles were ordered and delivered February 3rd. This is clear plastic so it's easy to see and watch the little creatures.  Right now they are in the water as they do not have legs yet. There is a bank, land and a small hut for the frogs once they evolve."
0,1,"Let me start out by saying I am a big fan of little people & had them as a child & have bought them for my child.  BUT I really dislike this toy!!  It looks like lots of fun but the cars won't loop the loop & stay on the track which is pretty much the whole idea of the toy.  The ferris wheel & swing are mildly entertaining but my daughter ignored the entire set until she realized that some (& only some) of her hot wheels cars will run the loop completely.  Fortunately, I didn't have to pay a dime for this toy as I got it free from a Pampers giveaway but unfortunately my belief in Little people has been tainted & I will be more careful when purchasing them.  I really thought their standards were higher but I guess this one slipped through their qc department!!!"
0,1,"I bought the original park for my then 2 yr old. She played w it for awhile but the coaster only works with the guy in it & then only sporadically, then it got dirt & dust & wouldn't work @ all. I loved little people as a kid but the new playsets are so cheap. They don't stay together & the pieces are easily lost. I was disappointed. I expected more from Fisher-Price."
0,1,"I got this for my youngest son when he was 8 months old.  Now he's 18 months old and he still plays with this all the time!  At first he was just interested in chewing on the ""mail"" and spinning the bumblebee, but now he pretends to mail the letters.  His 3 year old brother loves being a ""mailman"" also!  I never would have bought it if I hadn't found it on sale because I never thought they would have enjoyed it so much! I'm so glad that I bought it.I definitely wish that the bumblebee had an on/off switch.  That buzzing gets really irritating.  If it gets to a point where I can't stand it, I can just take the batteries out.  It would just be nice to have the option to turn it off."
0,1,"Among the Leap Frog products, this learning piano is terrific.  We've had it in our home for the last two years, and it's just as much fun as it was when it first entered our home.There are basically four areas of interest on this piano.  There's the piano sound, banjo, woodwind sound, and saxophone sound.  Then when you push each little circle with the picture of the instrument, you get a variety of different songs.  For example, the banjo sound plays the tune, among others, of ""Oh Susanna,"" and the piano sounds gives a really neat instrumental version of a ragtime piece.If for some reason you just push the button, the music will play for several seconds, and then the little voice will come on and say ""Press any key to play the song,"" and then you can continue the music up to the end by continuing to hit the keys.  It looks as if you're really playing the piano, too.Our girls have loved this, and its importance is in teaching not only the variety of music, but the different kinds of instruments, and the fun of interacting physically with the sounds, among other things.This product is really great!!  And highly recommended!!"
1,0,We had this for my older son when he was a baby and he loved it and now my baby loves it too! it lasts a long time and the kids love it!!
0,1,"My son got this when he was four months old.  At that age, he liked to watch us play it for him, but at five months he started playing with it himself.  The keys are easy for him to press and he really likes looking at himself in the mirror.There are three different learning modes (colors and shapes, songs, and free play). There are also four different instruments to choose from (banjo, flute, sax and piano).  Each instrument plays several different songs which are selected by pressing the instrument buttons surrounding the mirror.  The mirror has four flashing red light bars around it that light up when the keys are pressed.The only complaint I have with this toy is the volume.  As with some other Leap Frog toys we own, the sound is too loud on the lowest setting. The speaker is on the upper left side and I find it easy to hold my palm over it to lower the volume when I am helping play with the toy, but I am considering putting some tape over the speaker for times that my palm is not available."
0,1,"I bought this for my baby and put it together for him when he was 6 months old. It is VERY easy to assemble, which is a plus. At first he was not very interested in it, but at about 7 1/2 months he 'discovered' it! Now it is one of his favorite toys. He is now almost 9 months and loves to pull up on it. Great learning table!!"
0,1,"We got just got this for our 10 month old.  It is a very durable fun toy.  Everytime he plays with it he finds something new.  It teaches numbers,colors,shapes,music,opposites,cause and effect... I could go on and on.  This is really a fun activity for a little one.  My son is very tall for his age and has been pulling up and standing since he was about 6 months old so this was perfect for him since he is bored with the coffee table.  He likes to walk all the way around it and do the activities,over and over.  This is a great toy- worth the extra cash."
0,1,Speaker broke without much use (a common leapfrog problem) and the purple door comes off. Customer service told me the door is supposed to come off but I think that makes it hazardous. Great idea for a teaching toy. Just needs to be better made.
0,1,My kids and any other kids that come to my home LOVE this toy. It's the first thing they got to. We've had ours for about 2 years now and when ever any one I know have a baby I get this for them as their Happy six months old gift! This is a MUST have for any kid!
0,1,I bought this many years ago. Still going strong. Helps babies to learn. They love this table. I have handed it down. It's been through 20 families and still being handed down. Your babies will have many fun hours.
0,1,"Not for the reasons you think I would...sure it's great for our daughter (12 mos) to pull up on, dance to, be creative with the music, press buttons, learn the difference between open & closed, etc.. and she does love it.  But I love it for a totally different reason - it's the only toy in the last 5 years that I actually LIKE the music to (not just tolerate it, but really LIKE it)...Leap Frog has taken the standard ABC and 123 theme songs and jazzed them up a bit....quite a positive comment from parents who hear these tunes ALL DAY LONG......Thanks Leap Frog for helping out the parents too!"
0,1,"We have had this table for upwards of 2 years now and it is still a hit with young and older. We have a 3yr old and 1 yrs old who both love to push the buttons, open and close and dance to the music. It has two modes, one that is mostly sounds, and the second that uses more words. I like that it is tall enough to ecourage standing and then it also makes for great cruising. It doesn't slip when my child leans against it either. The sounds are still working fantastically and it hasn't broken yet. Even the ""book"" in the middle (which when you turn the page it changes the mode) has held up. I highly recommend this toy for any child that can stand, sit and loves to push, pull, open, close and play."
0,1,"My now 10 month old really loves this toy.  He learned to stand up at 8 months and this is a perfect height.  He really enjoys pushing, lifting, and moving all the different things, and he loves the music."
0,1,"This is by far the best toy we've bought for our 8 1/2 month son. Our son has played with this toy several times a day for 20 minutes each time since we bought it two months ago.In addition to the fact that I now can get some things done around this house (and that would be enough), there are other great things about this toy:-It's sturdy enough for little ones who are working on balance to pull up on, lean on, and cruise.-It teaches a variety of concepts, including numbers, the alphabet, opposites (open/close, hello/bye bye), colors, and shapes.-The sounds and music are really catchy. It has two modes, a numbers/letters and a music mode. Both include really fun, jazzy music, made by different instruments (piano, banjo, trumpet, violin, a music box, etc.). The numbers/letters mode also includes singing by a real human - not just electronic sounds. A nice change from the usual.-The toy has a volume control.I would recommend this toy without reservation. Great job, LeapFrog!"
0,1,"A wonderful gift my daughter received for her first birthday and still plays with after her second.  Catchy sounds, enticing lights and all-around fun for little hands.  Learning couldn't be any more fun!  Great shape - not too big, not too small, very stable for those learning to stand alone and a volume control!"
0,1,"i wish i would have saved the box,this is a waste of a toy"
0,1,I like this electric thomas better than the plastic trackmaster one. This one has stood the test of time and is still chugging along.
0,1,"We love Thomas' Wooden Railway and are excited about our new battery operated James. As always, good quality and durable, but I hate how it is metal instead of wooden. Also, the wheels don't move very easily when playing without it being battery operated. My son loves battery operated vehicles, but I hate the metal ones because the paint comes off them easier than the wooden ones."
0,1,My 7 year old Grandson spent many hours in the back yard collecting ants for this farm. We discussed and researched ants habits and habitats. This was a gift for Grammy as well as her Grandson. We are making memories with educational toys from Amazon.
1,0,"My kids received two of these as a present.Please understand, I live in the desert and ants are already a problem.Did I want to import ants into my house on purpose?  Not really.  I chickened out and gave both sets to a teacher.  We'll live vicariously."
0,1,"I have a 4 year old and a 2 year old, and I bought this game since it looked like something they could play together and they would be evenly matched. They both love playing the game, even if they think the person with the most bees wins. It's very cute, and it's inexpensive.. it made a great Christmas present. The only downside is, as other reviewers have mentioned, the lengthy set up time of poking the leaves through the hive. The kids kept wanting to play it but I asked them to play with something else because I was tired of how long it took to set up."
0,1,"one of my daughters favorite EI game. e have many. This ones a bit tedious for the parent due to having t stick the leavs through holes on one wide out through to the other that dont angle really well. But its cute, and will be great once she masters that part herself :)"
0,1,"I like the simplicity of this game and how long it takes to play. Young kids tend to lose interest in games that take too long. This is a nice short game and simple to understand. The unfortunate part of it is that the branches are not easy to get in. They go in easy at first when there aren't many other branches, but after a few it becomes increasingly more difficult. I think hive shape of the top add to this, but it doesn't ruin the game. I do like the game and I'm glad to add it to my kids game collection."
0,1,This is basically a ker-plunk game played with bees and a bee hive... but still it's very fun and colorful. My wife uses it at school with her kids and they love it. It's easy to set up and use... and the kids the mechanical aspect of setting it up and letting it all fall down.
1,0,This was a great game for 4 yr old granddaughter.  She loved the colorful bees.  A little hard to put leaves in without some adult help.
0,1,This sponge bob sno cone maker has surpassed our expectations in the longevity of the device.  A word of advice to anyone who buys this product is to use crushed ice from your ice maker.  I have read in other reviews on how poor this product works it has been the exact opposite.  Using the correct items aids in a fun time.
1,0,"This is a great toy for my 3 year old.  With the new booster pack, and the ability to change for any letter and numbers to 10, this is even more educational.  Finding the ball under the door is a bonus, and keeps the kids guessing.  My daughter learned most of her letters and the numbers 1 - 10 from this game.  Even my 6 year old will sit down and play with her, which is hard for him to do with a lot of games.  This one can be played by the whole family, and teaches even when it is another players turn.  Another great hit from Cranium.***For those who have the older version with only A B and C cards, contact Cranium, via their web site, and they will send you the ""booster"" pack, free of charge."
0,1,"I have a 3 yr old and a 5 1/2 yr old... its finally a game we can all play as a family without it being too hard for the little one.  They call it the treasure game and see finding the balls as a treasure hunt.  My 3 year old knows all his colors and shapes and is learning to recognize the numbers on the cards and corresponding shapes on the box lids...he loves it.  They love to win it and they love that we'll play it a million times in a row so everyone has the chance.  Its fast enough to do a quickie before bed or to sit and play over and over.  And because its so fast they know if they don't find the last ball, they will have another chance fairly soon.My 3 yr old isnt' into Candyland, etc... too much patience is required... but he LOVES this game!  My 5 1/2 yr old loves it too and it simply reinforces the stuff he's learned already which is great... and he likes to help his little brother too.  Its the best game out there for families with young kids as they can all get involved."
0,1,"This concept is good and the game can be fun but for a 3yr old who already knows their ABC's and 123's this was very boring very quick. I can't believe Amazon's recommended age was 4-7yrs old. I personally think anyone kindergarten or higher would be very bored with this one. GREAT for kids 2-4 yrs old though, of they are still learning their letters and numbers. Oh and be careful - those balls will bounce away and hide!!"
0,1,"I have a four year old and a six year old and they love to play this game.  They get to match words with little pictures which is a great way to get them interested in reading and spelling.  Also, the game has repeat play appeal.  We played yesterday and the kids loved it, and they want to play it again tonight.One minor inconvenience is that it does take a few minutes to reload the dispenser of yellow plastic word/picture pieces, but my sons happen to love reloading the little dispenser, so that actually makes it even more fun for them.  Your milage may vary in this area.That said, as I play with my kids I find myself wondering why there couldn't be several difficulty gradiated sets of words and cards.  It would be more fun for me as adult if there was more variation in the cards and the words in play.But the game is a lot of fun, and the price is right!"
0,1,I got this for my niece who will be 5 in Feb. she loves games and whats better then an educational game that will keep her attention? nothing thats what!
0,1,"Perfection for early elementary kids! Even my 2.5 year old loves this game. Just glancing through the previous reviews I have again noticed that some parents expect board games to prepare their kids for college level learning...people, let's just have fun; our kiddos are going to be fourteen before we know it. Hey, don't get me wrong- the word i.d. deal reeled me in, too, but then the fun factor just kinda took over. Don't even get me started on the set-up subject (please see my review on ""The Honey Bee Tree"" game). The above toddler loves attempting to put back the tiles- it keeps her busy, and I can enter La-La Land for several minutes. Note: there is an open groove in the tile holder to facilitate the actual tile placement, so if you are not a Yeti, obtain this game."
0,1,"I have two girls, ages 4 and 7 and this has got to be one of their favorite games so far. They are both very active little girls, but when they get their hands on this game they can play for over and hour.It is fun and teaches them word recognition. I would definitely recommend this one."
0,1,Perfect for younger kids who are interested in playing games. We're impressed with this company and look forward to purchasing other items.
0,1,"As a behavior specialist that works with kids with autism and other learning disabilities, I find this game as a perfect introduction for teaching turn-taking!!!  It also teaches matching and promotes social skills!!  Love it!!!"
0,1,"How many bingo games are there for little kids? Not a lot that are as fun as Zingo!We have used our game over and over. The red case is filled with hard yellow tiles that are hidden until slid forward into slots.Two tiles show at a time.Each player has a Zingo card filled with pictures. Each card is two sided, one red, one green. One color set of cards contains more shared items on a card. The other set has fewer shared items.The object of the game is to have the dealer slide the tiles forward for show and any player that has a matching picture on their card yells out the name of the picture. If they are the first to call it out, they get the tile. The first person to cover all the pictures on their Zingo card gets to yell (and in our house it gets rather loud) ZINGO!Two or more players may have a need for the same tile but it is the first to call it out that gets it.We always start by reading off the items on our cards. That gears the kids up to thinking about what they will need to look for and reinforces the picture/word relationship. Each picture has the matching word underneath on the cards as well as the tiles.It does become a little mundane for parents but it is an easy game to play in 5 minutes and can be played over and over before a child gets bored.I would recommend this for children ages 3-7."
1,0,"Zingo is a fun alternative to the basic, bland bingo.  This is much easier for younger kids to play.  Even us oldsters had fun with it.  I would recommend the game, especially if there is a youngster, preschool age and up, who likes games that peaks their senses and keeps their attention."
0,1,"My husband and I love playing this game with our 2 & 4 year olds. Everyone is engaged and we can play for long periods of time (unlike the other young toddler games that I'm bored with in 1 minute). The tile pieces are well-made, as are the dispenser and boards. Overall, I think this is the most fun game for the younger preschool age range that I've ever played. (We also love the Sneaky Snacky Squirrel.) That said, my 8-yr old nephew also loves it and we can get more competitive since he's faster than my 2-yr old. Surprisingly I rarely, if ever, throw a game against my 4-yr old. She's quick! Great time, I highly recommend it for boys or girls ages 2-8. Remember: &#34;it's bingo with a zing!&#34; so if your kid(s) can't handle the competition and speed, then buy regular bingo for a slower-paced, more predicable game."
0,1,"Fun, functional, easy to assemble, cut through and use roller cutter, this range from Melissa and Doug is once again a winner! Durable, fun accessory for any kids kitchen set up, my girls have lots of fun with this product.The only downfall is the small pizza topping pieces that get left all over the floor! Small price to pay really for something that creates so much fun! 10 out of 10!"
0,1,"As usual, a great quality toy from Melissa & Doug.  My 2-year-old got this for Christmas...it's almost March and she STILL plays with this every day!  She loves that she can ""slice"" her own pizza and mix up the toppings.  She goes around the house taking ""orders"" from everyone and then makes each person's pizza slice to their liking.  Wonderful toy!"
1,0,"I got this pizza set as a Christmas gift for my kids. Both my 2 yr old daughter and 6 yr old son love it! I love Melissa and Doug toys, their quality is amazing. The wood never breaks like plastic toys. They have endless fun trying different toppings, serving it to me, and pretending to eat the pizza. And Amazon always has the best prices on their toys. I see Melissa and Doug in educational toy stores and bookstores, but they are always higher priced. Highly recommend this pizza set!"
0,1,"Another great Melissa and Doug toy!  My daughter just received this for her 2nd birthday and the fun hasn't stopped yet!  She loves to take  all the toppings off and create a new pizza each time!  We're the happy recipients of a big pizza pie all day long!This pizza set is great for hand-eye coordination and her imagination booms with each new pizza she makes.  The wooden utensils (spatula and pizza cutter) feel sturdy and I know they'll last a long time.  Even better is the wooden box with lid to store the pieces so they don't get lost or misplaced.  I wouldn't recommend this for children under two since the pizza toppings are small and look fun to suck on and eat.  Danger lurks ahead for little ones who aren't being supervised!I'm a huge fan of Melissa and Doug toys because of their great quality.  We also own the sandwich making kit, the cutting food box, and the cutting birthday cake (perfect to give as a birthday present)!  You just can't go wrong with these toys!  Not only fun and imaginative but also educational!The absolute best part:  clean-up time!  She has fun sorting out (with my help, of course) the matching toppings and placing them in the same compartment together.  Voil&agrave;!  Another skill is being mastered!"
0,1,"Melissa & Doug toys are worth the price!  They are durable, fun and encourage hours of imaginative play.  My 4 yr old has multiple food sets (birthday cake, cookies, cupcakes, ice cream)and this pizza party completes the make believe party menu!"
1,0,"Anyone who owns any Melissa and Doug toys knows that they are educational, fun and DURABLE! This pizza set is no exception. Kids love to ""cook"", and this is a great way for them to do it. It can be a super-helpful toy if Mom or Dad needs a minute to cook dinner and wants to occupy the children and keep them out from underfoot while they do it.... set them up at the table and let them make a pizza! Heck, even let them put it on the table and ""serve"" it with dinner!These toys are so worth the cost... which is relatively cheap, if you think about the fact that these will never break and they'll be played with for much longer than other skimpy plastic toys. Treat your kids to this great playset made with quality long-lasting materials. Wonderful!"
0,1,"I have bought a lot of toys, and this is one of my favorites.  My daughter got this and the birthday cake for her 3rd birthday and what a hit!  All ages loved these toys- from 8 to 1.  They were by far the most played with gifts of the day.  Such a great, almost-obvious, idea!  Good job Melissa & Doug!"
0,1,"This is another great toy from M&D that kids will have countless of hours playing with. There are three different toppings, enough to completely cover every slice with whatever toppings they choose. Everything comes in a convenient container that sepparates all the toppings, and room for tray, pizza, and utensils. My daughter loves making slices to order, but with the placement of velcro on all the slices, it could be tricky for younger kids to get all the toppings spaced properly. The only problem my daughter had with the toy was when she was cutting slices. She would have no problem cutting the first edge, but when she'd cut the other edge the piece would slide and reattach where she first cut. It was entertaining to watch, but eventually there had to be some mommy/daddy intervention to get the first piece out of the pie. There's plenty of opportunity to teach counting, motor skills, and creating patterns with the toppings."
1,0,"This is a very simple toy.  Pizza toppings velcro to the top of the pizza.  Use the wooden pizza cutter & server...the end.  However, it's a very well made wooden toy, and it inspires creativity.My 3yo son loves to help in the kitchen.  With this toy, he can pretend to make us all pizza w/ the toppings he chooses or asks us what kind of pizza we want.  It's a nice alternative to all the moving, noisemaking toys (which we have plenty of)!  :)"
0,1,"And this item did not disappoint.  I bought this last Christmas for a 3-year-old girl and it was a big hit as well with three older girls up to the age of 9.  Everyone played with it, taking turns decorating the pizza and serving the grown ups.  This year, I bought it for my 4-year-old niece who just loves to &#34;cook&#34;.  Disappointingly, I wont get to see her play with it as she lives in Czech Republic, but her dad has promised to tell her it came from her &#34;favorite aunt in the US&#34;."
1,0,"We got this train at a local thrift store for $1.50 with all the pieces included. What a hit! The first day that we had it, my 20 month old (then 18 months old) played with it almost the entire day. Since then, it has been played with every single day. It's a great toy, very durable, and a huge hit in our house. I would definitely recommend it."
1,0,Good functional toy. It helped our 15 month old figure out how to stack the blocks on the pegs on the trains. After that he was able to get this basic idea with other toys he has. It looks very nice and he keeps going back to it.  My only concern is if he falls on the toy as it is wooden and hard but he does have decent balance these days.
0,1,"Not sure who loves this toy more, the grandkids or their Papa.  Bright colors, lots of shapes, and on WHEELS!  What's not to love?  I love the fact that there are no sharp edges.  I recommend Melissa and Doug toys to all my friends."
0,1,"We bought this for our youngest son last Christmas.  He is now 2 1/2 years old and still plays with it almost every day.  It is very well made, and very reasonably priced.  In the beginning, we had to sit with our son to show him how to put the train back together, but now he's a pro.  This is a toy we'll be pulling out for a grandchildren in the years to come, as long as he doesn't feed any of the blocks to our dog!!  I highly recommend this toy; it gets more ""play time"" than our leappad, lego table or Vtech toys."
1,0,"My son is 3-yrs old and he is infatuated with cars.  I bought this for him because he loses them a lot since he has to carry one or two EVERYWHERE he goes.  So far the cars perform well, they roll great on smooth surfaces.  My only complaint, and this is a very small complaint, is that some of the cars are raised as if they are on hydraulics.  My son likes to crash and smash his cars together so the ones that are raised slightly higher off the wheels have become damaged and by damaged I mean the wheels are kinda bent inward.  Really small though since there are only one or two cars like that in the whole package of ten that he got.  Overall I think the set is wonderful as far as sets of cars go."
0,1,"This is a very popular toy at our house.  Together with the wand, we have moved, danced, jumped and bumped all over the playroom.The five different styles of music all invoke a distinctive movement with my children.  What fun it is to watch them and to play with them, too.The quality of music is impressive.  Our MusicSensor did not work well until we reset.  Now it is perfect!  We have purchased additional music cartridges, but like the one it came with the best.  This unique toy is one I highly recommend!!"
0,1,The age range is 6yrs and up but looking at the simple shooting mechanism I bought it in hopes my 3yo daughter could use it. It's a fun toy for adults but it requires more force than a child under 6yo can provide. Too bad they don't have something similar for younger kids.
0,1,"I bought this for my son after leaving his cousin's house.  He had fun playing with it there, so I caved and bought one.  Since it's new, it's a little harder to shoot, but once we break it in it will be fun!"
1,0,"My son received this as a Xmas gift...his first 'gun' of any kind at age 5 1/2. He couldn't love it more! It's more than tough enough to take his abuse, it can blast these balls clear across the room, but yet it's not so aggressive that it makes the occassional little sister interception painful. Hours of indoor fun on these cold winter weekends!"
0,1,"I bought this for my 9-year-old, but the first time I played it was adults (and a 4-year-old).  We were ALL laughing and having a good time!  We even learned a thing or two!  This is a fun game even for adults.  Yes, it's gross, but it's not THAT gross... good grief I'm a mom - I'm not grossed out that easily!  Highly recommended for the whole family."
0,1,"On the surface, Pop-Up Pirate looks like it's aimed towards the younger crowd, but underneath that kiddy exterior is a game so complex and demanding that we Mensa members even bust it out occasionally. What you don't know is that Pop-Up Pirate uses super-advanced algorithms and formulas to determine what slit will blow that silly little pirate's top off.It is very hard to explain, but I will try to put as best as I can in layman's terms. Every slit and sword color combination produces a certain number. For example; Slit #17, combined with a red sword, produces the number 678. This number by itself means nothing, but once another sword is put in the barrel, a certain condition is made. For example; Slit #12 with a blue sword followed by slit #8 with a green sword produces the condition ""factor of 4"". Subsequent numbers that are produced must adhere to this condition, or else the pirate pop meter raises by 1. When the meter reaches 5, the pirate of course pops out of the barrel. The meter may raise more than 1 depending on the severity of a produced number's unfaithfulness to the condition, but we're not sure yet how this severity is measured.Another factor to the game is where exactly the pirate lands. The location were his head meets the ground will affect the pirate pop meter in the next match. We believe that is the pirate lands on his northwestern quadrant, the pirate pop meter changes its maximum capacity to 7 in the next match. This is only a claim, but rest assured we are doing extensive testing to prove this and other hypotheses.So you see, to you it is but a simple child's game. To us here at Mensa, it is an ongoing intelligent battle that we may never come to fully understand unless we preform at our very best."
1,0,"We found this product in our local toy shop and for $15 I figured why not.  Of course my 4 year old thinks the object of the game is to get the pirate to shoot out so that's always our goal.  The plastic that the knives are made out of are decent and have some flex to them to wiggle them into the slots (which occassionally you do have to tweak it just right), the plastic that the barrel is made out of is a bit cheap.  The spring that causes the pirate to shoot out is decent and so the pirate gets decent height (see the picture album for an example.)The biggest complaint that I am seeing in the lesser starred reviews is that the spot to eject the pirate is always the same.  THIS IS USER ERROR and not the fault of the game.  The way that you randomize the pop up spot is with the pressure peg that the pirate ultimately rests on.  Before you push it down to reset it - you simply twist it this causes the location of the ""the spot"" to change.My son plays this over and over and OVER again.  He's made that pirate pop up at least 100 times.  There have been about 5 times in that 100 that he gets all the knives in and the pirate didn't pop.  So it's not 100% accurate, but for less than 10% error on the part of the popping pirate there is no fun lossed.  If this product cost more than $20 I might complain about the general quality of it all, but for under $15 you really can't go wrong with the element of fun that it has associate with it.If you have a child that loves pirates this is a must."
1,0,"Purchased as gift for 4 year old grandson... he loved it!  Even his not-quite-2-year-old brother was able to play and the slightly older grandchildren were entertained too.  The older kids did figure out fairly quickly which hole sprung the pirate, but still a great toy for the suggested age group."
0,1,"Not thrilled by this game.  I was hoping that it would be more challenging than it is, and it is pretty cheaply made."
0,1,"As a speech therapist, my students love this game. They get to shove swords into a barrel to see if a pirate pops out- what could be more fun! My students do a flashcard or some kind of word to earn their turn, so it's a fun reward for them. On the other hand, to use with your own kids at home, I think they would get bored with it. Other than taking turns, there's not much to the game other than sticking swords into a barrel. The swords are sometimes hard to push in, so I often have to help three year olds do it. In a classroom structured situation, my students from ages 3 to 9 have enjoyed this game."
0,1,"I bought this 3D Solar System on a whim. It was on sale, and I thought the glow in the dark aspect might help cure my 3 year old boy of his fear of the dark. It arrived in the mail two days later and he was so excited to hang the planets up above his bed. Even my one year old was excited, chanting ""Moon!"" and ""Ball!"" over and over again. The kit comes with clear string and star shaped thumbtacks to push into the ceiling. It also comes with glow in the dark star stickers. The planets come with two labels each. We attached one label on the bottom of the planet, and one on the side. The labels peel off a pit over the months, and you'll have to press them back down every few months. My Son immediately started learning the names of each of the planets. I cut out a section of the back of the box that told a bit about each planet. For the next few weeks, he fell asleep every night with that piece of box clutched in his hand.Since then, we've added to the planets. It includes pluto so we added four more dwarf planets: Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris; and we added a comet, space shuttle and asteroid belt.Pros: Develops an interest in the Solar System. Everything you need to install is included. Durable, Educational, and Fun.Cons: The stickers don't stick well. Pluto could be confusing. It's the only dwarf planet included, they should either take it out or add the other dwarf planets. The colors are a little off. Saturn is not that green, and neptune is more of a blue purple than a pink purple. There is no sun included, so you'll have to get creative with arranging the planets. We put a yellow circle on the wall, but I've heard of others arranging the planets around a ceiling light."
0,1,"I decided to try these for my 4 yr old's room, despite the somewhat negative reviews. He loves learning about the planets, and also loves the glow in dark stars on his ceiling so I thought these would make a great addition. And they are wonderful!! We are so in love with them every night when the lights go out. The plastic is lightweight so they can easily hang from fishline, not necessarily cheap. Assembling the planets and stringing them to fishline is fairly easy. Tying a little loop on the other end to hang from the pin took a little patience, but not too bad. The star-shaped pins hold them securely to ceiling with no problem. The different colors and patterns make each planet glow brighter or dimmer, for a realistic touch. I will agree a downfall is the sheet of glow stars they include....they are TINY, could fit on my thumbnail. But they are great filler stars IF you buy some larger glow stars to fill the ceiling, and I highly recommend you do! The star sets made by Great Explorations & University Games are great, OR the jar of stars made by The Toysmith are great too - all available on Amazon. The key is to get sets with different size stars, it really makes your ceiling universe pop. I was so impressed by how amazing his room looked at night....that I bought another set of planets and large set of stars for OUR room (keep watch on these, as Amazon often puts them on sale - I got mine for $9.99 w/ free s/h!) And now I'm so in love with my nighttime universe, as much as my little boy! I look forward to gazing at it every night before my eyes quickly close on another exhausting wonderful day."
0,1,"The planets were much nicer, more colorful and a tad larger (nice!!!) than I expected them to be. I bought these along with the Uncle Milton's Moon in my Room for my 5 year old nepew. We haven't opened the product because it was his christmas gift, but I was able to shine light on the planets through the packaging and they did glow well in the dark. I didn't really see how long they retained their glow because I fell asleep...lol. Very cool, I expect he will get many nights of enjoyment from his nightime friends. I will update the review should any problems with the product arise. So far, I am well pleased with my purchase!"
0,1,"How about an actual product review?This book features a story about Snow White, one about Cinderella and one about Ariel. The Snow White story involves the princess and the dwarfs helping a deer remove a thorn from its paw. The Cinderella story is about her getting ready for the ball. The Ariel story is about her going off to explore the shipwreck but returning in time for the concert.Ina ddition to the stories, there are several games in the book, all age-appropriate. The final page is a simple game involving all three princesses and scenes/objects from their stories.The educational value in the book is in reading, reading comprehension, vocabulary building, etc. If you're familiar w/ LeapPad books, you'll find this one in keeping with their usual standard. A nice choice for the preschool set; it would be nice if more LeapPad books were aimed at this level."
0,1,"The balls are not very sturdy. My husband thinks this is a good thing, because they are less likely to injure my one year old. It seems like they are deflating though :/"
1,0,Grand baby LOVES this toy. HAPPY happy happy happy happy She plays with this everyday and smiles from ear to ear.
0,1,"These balls are okay and they worked great for just topping off my daughter's ball pit. They tend to dent, but this isn't too much of a problem for us since they were more just filler balls and we purchased 200 to add to the 500 more durable ones we already had, so we don't notice too much. They served their purpose as a cheap addition for us, but they might be more of an annoyance if they were the main balls in the pit."
1,0,My little one likes these. They are soft enough to play with or hold. There are so many and the colors are bright.
1,0,"I have discovered that this toy should be treated as a book.  It really isn't something that my 18 month old can sit and play with by himself AND get anything out of.  In order for your child to learn anything from it, you really need to sit down with your child and operate the book along with him.  My son seems completely uninterested in it.  It will probably be one of those toys that we give away to Goodwill this year."
0,1,Starter doll house for my 20 mth old. Good deal for wooden dollhouse with furniture and 2 people. She hasn't shown a great deal of interest in it yet so it's in the closet and I will reintroduce it in a few months. The dollhouse would look nice painted
0,1,"I talked my daughter out of buying the larger Breyer stable in favor of this much cheaper one. I told her we could paint it if she ally wanted. When it arrived I could not believe how big it was. I never even looked at the measurements to be honest but even so it is very large. One of the doors did fall off fairly easily when I hit it accidentally with my leg but it was glued back on without issue. I do wish it had a lock to keep it closed when moving it but that is neither here nor there. The stables are large enough to hold a couple of horses each. She was absolutely elated when it arrived. It also came with a large, beautiful wooden fence. If you have a 6/7 year old child that loves Breyer horses this is THE accessory to get."
0,1,"Good overall pretend play item. For the price, they could do a little more sanding of some of the wood surfaces. My daughter loves it and plays with all kinds of her toys in the stable not just horses."
0,1,"Even more beautiful in person. It's superb quality, very nice barn. I got it for my two year old, who absolutely loves this barn. It folds up easily, it unfolds just as easily. It has plenty of space on the inside. Everyone comments on this barn when they come to my house and asks where I got it. The price was excellent for what I got and this very much exceeded my expectations.Don't get any other, this one is perfect."
0,1,"My 2 1/2 year old son who loves animals absolutely adores this little barn!  Even though he doesn't have a long attention span (barely one at all!), he will spend lots of time with the barn and the little animals that come with it.  He loves opening and closing the doors and talking to the animals.  It's been very sturdy as he has climbed and stood on it several times.  The little 2-piece fence did break off, but could be glued back on easily.  The rest of it hasn't even flinched. ;)"
0,1,"They are small and fun for little guys to stack, but the pictures and letters on each block are not associated in any way... Which makes no sense to me at all.  Also, they have somewhat sharp corners and are VERY painful to step on.  Otherwise, they a good toy.  At age two, my son loved to stack and build with them, but hadn't much interest in the letters.  He could not put them back in the box himself, but it wasn't too much work for an adult to keep the blocks straight while plopping them in."
1,0,"I finally found what keep my kids occupied and learning, while sharing with each other."
0,1,I was so excited when I found these blocks. I thought they were so cute and just what my son needed.When I received them many of the blocks had chucks missing around the corners and the colored lettering was chipped and fading. They are also ALOT smaller than I expected them to be.Overall this is a cheap disappointing product. I would not recommend to anyone.
1,0,"Much smaller than I expected, but still a lot of fun! I would get these if the baby doesn't put a lot of stuff in their mouths any more."
0,1,"We got this when my son was about one, and it was great for entertaining him in the car. He is now almost three and can play the find the letters game and loves when it ""claps"" for a correct answer. I was going to get one as a gift for a friend, but it is more expensive than I remembered...."
0,1,"My daughter got this toy for her first birthday and has loved it since. She is now 3 and a half and plays with it almost everyday. My 11 mth old son loves it too. I would reccomend this to anyone as a great toy for kids 9mths to 4 yrs or older. It's very durable. I can't tell you how many times my daughter has dropped it down our stairs, and it always works. Its very well made."
0,1,"Bought this for my 2 year old for the car to keep her busy.It does the job and also helps her to learn the ABC""S.She has droped it and carried it around.We even took it a public place,it is a little loud and no volume button."
0,1,"By the time my son had played with this for a while, the paint began chipping off!  There are little chips all over each ring and the top ball.  Honestly, he didn't even play with it that much.  So now, I'm tossing it out rather than handing it down to my daughter.  Such a shame, but I've found that most Melissa and Doug toys (all made in China!) just don't have the durability you would expect for the price."
1,0,"I wish they made the ""rounds"" just a little larger. I am sure that is why it is rated for 18 months and up. My baby is 7 1/2 months and we purchased this toy to play with while under our supervision until she is the appropriate age. I feel like if the rounds were just a little bigger it would be perfect for younger and older kids alike."
0,1,"My son has had this puzzle for a year and has been ROUGH on it.  They have been chew toys, stomped on, thrown, and whatever else a toddler does!  After a year, the corners of the fish and puzzle are just starting to show wear (the corner is peeling off a little on the puzzle).  Knowing just how much my son plays with this puzzle- I consider it a fantastic investment.I don't think I would choose this one as a first puzzle like we did- there were more pieces on this puzzle than other Melissa and Doug puzzles.  Our son didn't really ""get"" how to put it together correctly until after we got a few more puzzles.  This is a great puzzle for learning colors though!"
0,1,"I love this puzzle!  My son didn't get ""into"" puzzles until he was about until he was about 19 or 20 months old.  ""Fish"" was one of the words my son could say, so when I saw this puzzle I snapped it up.  The Easter bunny brought this just over a month ago.  All of the pieces are the same shape, so it is definitely a color match up.  I have been surprised at how quickly he has learned to match the colors.  It's almost too easy, but it is definitely his favorite!"
0,1,My daughter loves fish and gets a kick out of me mixing the fish tails and then reorganizing them.  FUN!
0,1,This is my son favorite puzzle of all his puzzles. He goes to this puzzle first and doesn't care about the other.
0,1,This is a great puzzle to use to teach children their colors. They also learn how to place the right puzzle with the right color. It teaches them sequence and organization skills.
1,0,"Our baby is only 7 months, so I can't give an extremely detailed review.  However, since she is practicing sitting alone now we are so glad we have these because of our hardwood floors.  She's toppled over a few times while sitting on the mats and it didn't even phase her at all.  I can see that the edges you can buy would be a worthwhile investment as our daughter is starting to chew on the edges of the pieces we already have.  If you have hardwood floors like us, I would say this is a must-have item for barely mobile babies!  One note is that they can be scratched (my wedding ring has given ours a few nice gouges), but, hey, they're foam.  So they're probably not the best for older siblings to use their harder plastic toys.  Definitely worth the money!"
0,1,"We have ALOT in our backyard. Kiddie pool, sandbox, sand and water table, swing set, a custom built tree house, but we didnt have this. Our 3 year olds loved the see-saws at nursery school, that they got this one for their birthdays in February! It is VERY educational because it teaches cause and effect, cooaperation, and sharing. My twins love going back and forth and its very safe. They now know that this see-saw takes TWO people to ride, while the police rocker and doggie rocker in the basement were for one person. I hear them pretending its a ship and I've seen four kids on it at a time. We all love it and its a very nice looking see-saw too!"
0,1,"I noticed this when we got the matching sandbox/picnic table set and later got it for our toddler and baby.  Our toddler thinks it is much more fun with two (not using it alone as some do).  We have to hold the baby on right now, but in a matter of months, it is going to be even more fun!  Giggles galore. :)ETA: March 2010 This still sits in our yard looking brand new year round! Amazing!"
1,0,"I have read the other reviews on this car seat and i have to give it 5 stars and here is why; I purchased this car seat for my 5 month, 21 lb son (no, he doesn't eat Big Macs) ha. I am impressed as my main concern was fitting a car seat into my compact 4 door sentra. I did not want a large and bulky car seat as I have had problems with other car seats getting in the way of the front seat driver or passenger seats. The adjustable strap mechanism is a very nice bonus and it is easy to use. The cushion is nice and ""plushy"" for my  baby and he appears very cozy in the reclining position. The inside straps underneath the padding are easy to get to compared to most car seats and I am not concerned with my child trying to ""rip out the foam"". This car seat is a perfect size, even for compact cars, there is no separate base to worry about and the new tether attachment is simple and easy rather than the seatbelt attachment (2003 models and newer?) I also like the appearance of the rear fo the car seat in the rear facing position. I have a 5 year old daughter and I have never had problems with escape artists trying to unbuckle themselves in my car; except for my girlfriend's 11 month old daughter was successful in unbuckling her infant car seat. Escapr artists come in all shapes and sizes, we Parents must closely observe our children, even when we think that they are behaving. I would recommend a baby seat mirror in your vehicle, especially for a rear facing positioned car seat so that you can catch your little escape artist. This is a very nice car seat overall, but I am not impressed with Evenflo's customer service. I had a problem with a stroller that I purchased less than 90 days prior, but since the date of manufacture on the stroller was over 3 years ago, Evenflo would not fix the problem with the stroller. I suppose that is why they call it a LIMITED warranty. Take care!"
1,0,"My son is 7 months old and because he is already 20 lbs. has outgrown his infant seat.  We had so much trouble installing his old seat base into my car that we were not looking forward to the switch.  My husband installed this seat much quicker.  We did have a little trouble because my seats are very slanted, but with the help of a couple of swim noodles, we got it in.  I love this seat!  Living in Michigan and the constantly changing weather, I hated having to adjust the straps on his old seat according the the bulk of his outfit (I couldn't even tighten them myself), but I absolutely love the ease of this seat!!  The adjuster on the side is a great idea (also the fact that there is one on each side), and so easy to use!  I just loosen it to put him in and then tighten it to fit properly.  The seat also seems to be very comfortable.  I have not had any trouble with the straps yet.  And, yes the instructions are hard to find (under seat padding), but as a previous reviewer stated-you really don't need them.  My husband and I traveled 2 hours and hunted for this seat and it was well worth it!"
0,1,"My friend recommended this to me, and I'm so glad.  It has the most reclining positions than any other seat, it is easy to use and it very comfortable (the cushion)."
0,1,"This phone is soooo cool! We got it for our 9 month old daughter and she loves it! Every time we give it to her she laughs out loud forever! I couldn't get over how articulate and clear the sounds, voices, and words are. Blue, red, yellow, numbers, etc. They are all spoken perfectly and not slurred or mumbled. I just wouldn't believe how far toys have come! The mirror in the phone is not one of the plastic, blurry ones. However, it is very safe inside its plastic shell. This phone has been dropped a lot and its still going strong! Very cool toy! I would definetly buy/recommend this phone again!"
0,1,"Best prices of all the stores online.  We gave this to our 6 year old son for Christmas, and he adores it. We are buying him the light circuits for his upcoming birthday he enjoys it so much.  There are so many different projects, and he is so excited that he can do a lot of them all on his own without any help.  He is so proud of himself, and it's a great learning &#34;toy&#34;."
0,1,"this was one of the best presents I ever got my kids - both my son and daughter at the time I think they were 8 and 10 - excellent - excellent can't say enough about it - it's not hard and everything they have in the instructions not only works like a door knob, etc, but it was easy enough for my 8 year old daughter to not need my help - strongly recommend"
1,0,"Bought this as one of the presents for my 7-year old daughter. She absolutely loved it, she's been playing it everyday ever since Christmas the day she opened it. In the 1st few days, I had to show her how to put everything together, she picked it up really quick, now she can play it by herself. So far she has done over 20 projected and had a lot of fun with them. Still a long way to go though. I will get the more advanced one after she's done with this one. Wish I had had this kind of game while I was a kid."
1,0,My 7 year old son got this for Christmas and he LOVES it! It's challenging yet he has a great time learning how everything goes together. He's made a bunch of the stuff in the book and loves having us check it all out when he's finished. He can spend hours upon hours playing with this toy.
0,1,Santa brought this for my 7 year old son for Christmas.  It has been so much fun creating projects together.  He loves to see what he can make.  The directions are simple to follow.  The pieces go together well.  Best of all is the sense of discovery and learning my son has as he uses it.
0,1,Bought this for Christmas for my husband and grandson to work on together.  This is a quality toy and worth the price.
0,1,"I love the fact that they don't snap together and there are so many different shapes and sizes. They are very sturdy, well made blocks! My 18 month old, 6 year old and 7 year old all play with these blocks and have a great time building all sorts of things!"
0,1,I bought these for our son as a Christmas gift a few years ago and they were a big hit.  I have now purchased them 3 other times for my nephews.  everyone loves using them....children and adults.
0,1,"This is a fun block set. My two year old loves it. We play all the time. Our set was bought used and was missing a few blocks, but for the most part it is a great item."
0,1,"Although the blocks themselves are all much smaller than I had imagined (choking hazards not for the young child), they are great little blocks!I bought them when my son was 2 and he is 4 now and still making castles and towers with them.  A timeless toy and child is sure to enjoy."
1,0,Melissa & Doug 100 Piece Wood Blocks Set rocks! We use ours with my sons GuideCraft Mirror and colorful Sand Blocks! It helps make his structures bigger and taller to make a better KNOCK DOWN! :) Seeing as how that's our favorite part of building with blocks. They are smaller than other building blocks and are a great addition to any blocks your little one already has or for LITTLE hands. My 2 year old likes the fact that because they aren't HUGE he can have one in each hand and build faster. It's a great toy to teach patience and precision. 100 pieces is a perfect amount too!
0,1,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON THAT IS 3 AND I THINK IT WILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON HIM TOWARDS GOING TO PRE-SCHOOL... CAUSE OF THE SHAPES AND COLORS :) I LOVE IT! I GOT IT FOR HIM FOR CHRISTMAS.. SO ITS GOING TO BE HIDDEN FOR AWHILE BUT I THINK HE WILL LOVE IT!
0,1,"These blocks are great.  You get plenty for play. Some brands don't provide enough, and some provide too many.  This package is just right.  My only complaint is that some are small, which is a hazard if you have younger children in the house.  I wouldn't recommend these for children under 3.  Otherwise they're great."
0,1,"Third set I have purchased.  Just the right size spoor little hands.  Study and easy storage,kids just love them .  This was bought for a two year old pre-school's Angel Tree."
1,0,Grand children using these blocks to supplement the set their mother played with.  The variety of shapes are helping the 2 year old to learn shapes. &#34;What's this?&#34; She asks before she uses a block in her latest building project.  Have to have another container for storage because set &#34;precisely packed&#34; and one cannot ever get them back into the original configuration for storage in the original container.
0,1,"Great wood block shapes and sizes, the grandkids play with these when they visit and can keep them occupied for a good hour. Fast delivery, excellent product, thanks!"
1,0,"I had a group of children, mixed genders, ages 1, 2, and 4 over to play with these. they loved them. it did cause some fighting, but it was somehow resolved. kids like it."
0,1,"Though they are on the smaller side, these blocks are awesome!There are so many of them and the colors are bright and fun.  Very good toy for those who love building with their imaginations!"
0,1,"My 3 year old twins got a set of these for Christmas from a friend and they love it!  I actually need another set because once one starts playing then everyone wants to play.  My boy and my girl both love these and so do all their friends.  Really fun building set, even I've had fun playing with them.  I would definatly buy these for a friend."
1,0,"This is a great toy for all ages- babies to adults.  My 1 year old likes to knock down the towers that my older kids and I make.  It comes with a pattern book to make different designs.  Kids really like this simple but intriguing toy.  Whats best is it doesn't need batteries, doesn't make noise, and challenges their creativity."
0,1,"Wedgits are wonderful!!  We got this small set at a yard sale, and it only interested my youngest child (I think he was 3 at the time) and he only built a few things with it and didn't play with it very much. But then he got the ""35 Wedgits to go"" set for Christmas last year, and it made all the difference.  It had an idea book, and with all the extra pieces, all of my kids (now 5, 8, and 10) have gone to town.  This toy is ALWAYS out, mostly my 5 and 8 year old, building lots of cool things.So if money is an issue, this set may keep a smaller child happily occupied.  However, if you want to extend the toy's lifespan, I would get the largest set you can get, preferably one with a good idea book."
0,1,"These Avent cups are very, very durable and put up with a lot of abuse from any overactive toddler.  They've fallen off the roof of my car, rolled down stairs, etc. without incident.  The parts are interchangeable with other Avent products, which is a big plus.But they leak from time to time where the cap screws onto the bottle.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason to this pattern of leakage, but having milk/juice/tea/water run down a toddler's hands and arms is no fun to clean.And cleaning these things can be a real pain.  The caps are composed of 5 parts that are nearly impossible to remove once they or your hands are wet.  The tapered clear caps are especially difficult to pull off unless your hands are made of sticky tape or sandpaper."
0,1,Harvey is the coolest of all engines:). It has a crane that can be twisted towards back or front (or sides) and also moved up and down. I am not sure if it really can pull other engines along the tracks...but it is pretty complex and very cute ...because of this complexity it is an interesting toy even without the tracks...good value for the money. My son loves it.
1,0,Harvey is a crane engine who was introduced in Salty's Secret. He can pull the other engines along with coaches or trucks. His magnet works perfectly and Harvey is espically good for your money.
0,1,The Salty that I own and all other ones i've seen in person have had three wheels. Also the real Salty has three wheels too. The magnet on Salty is very strong and it can pull a lot of cars. Salty runs smoothly on the track and his wheels work perfectly. This one is a great buy.
1,0,"This toy is amusing for my child, but I've found that the first thing she did was realize there are two buttons on the top that cause all the lights and music - she doesn't try to stack the rings, she just keeps hitting the buttons to get the music.  The stacker looks pretty with the rings on, but when the rings are off, the white light is a little too bright for my taste.  If you want an educational toy, get a regular non-musical stacker instead and if you want a musical toy, I'm sure there are ones on the market that do more than have just 2 buttons and play songs, but this does not encourage the child to learn how to stack the rings."
1,0,"Ive read many of the reviews on this toy prior to purchasing it so I knew about the volume decrease.  I also knew how to ""fix"" the volume decrease by putting a small piece of paper or cardboard into the slot in the backside of the phone in the right corner.  However, I want to strongly urge parents NOT to do that.  The volume is really loud when you adjust it to be louder and if a child puts it up to their ear they could really damage their hearing.  I put it up to my ear to test it and it was way too loud for me, let alone a toddler's sensitive hearing.  My advice is, if your child knows how to ""use"" a phone, ie. put it up to their ear, buy it, if not, skip it or you will be disappointed."
0,1,"I purchased this toy after reading 177 reviews which gave the toy an average of 3.5 stars. My kid played with the toy off and on for 3 months. the phone didn't seem special to him, he would bring it to me to press the buttons and then afterward he would grab another toy. After noticing the phone didn't work any longer I replaced the batteries. At this point the phone doesn't make any sound. I have replaced 2 sets of batteries and still the toy doesn't work. I would rate this as junk to any prospective buyer to beware of it."
1,0,"I was looking for a fun phone for my daughter (11 months old at the time). Unfortuantely for us, this was the only phone I could find at all the local retailers. Although, because it had Elmo on it, I was willing to give it a shot.The extremely low volume is both good and bad - it's great for using in church and other places you don't want &quot;another loud toy&quot;. However it's very poor when trying to listen for the numbers and/ or pictures displayed on each button.In addition, the size of the phone is a bit big for tiny hands. My daughter is on the small side, therefore until just recently, she needed 2 hands to hold onto the phone.I would save your cash and find a different phone that offers more educational values and skip the fact that this one has Elmo on it !"
0,1,"I bought this Elmo phone at the consignment store after my daughter's old toy cellphone mysteriously disappeared.  That was the best $3 I have EVER spent--I think the full price here on Amazon still is quite worthwhile.  My daughter is 20 months old and has had this phone for at least six months--she plays with it every day for 45+ minutes.  She ADORES this phone.The volume is perfect for her and she has no problem hearing it.  I can hear it (softly) from across the room when she plays, but it doesn't grate on my nerves the way some of her toys do.The buttons make various noises--typical phone beeping noises, names of the numbers, as well as various sounds (airplane, crayon, horn, etc.)  Elmo greets the child when the phone is opened (it's a ""flip-style"" phone) and says good-bye when the phone is closed.It has proven quite durable too and has not suffered from being dropped on hard surfaces.  This phone goes EVERYWHERE with us and definitely is one of her top three favorite toys.It is great for pretend play--she delights in using the phone to call her grandma and her various aunts.  Last night I held our real phone up to her ear while she talked with her grandma (a real phonecall) and she held her Elmo phone up to her other ear!We LOVE this phone!"
0,1,We bought this toy for our son on his first birthday but the neighbor kid took it. It was a nice toy and he liked it.
1,0,"Bought these as a reward for my daughter, who has had to take disgusting medicine twice a day for ten days.  Yes, you would think HEALTH would be reward enough for her, but hey, she's only 4.  Anyhow, she was really impressed by these pencils when we explained how they worked, but in reality, it just created a wet mess on the paper.  I will play with them myself sometime and see if I can come up with a better technique, but for a young child, they aren't that great."
1,0,Crayola never disappoints me. The chalk is just as expected. No dust at all and a lot came in the package.
0,1,"These are nice, bright paints that our little one enjoys. She is fond of colouring/painting and so we bought multiple of Crayola paints of different colours. She absolutely loves them. They are also very easy to clean which is very important with a 4 yr old who is bound to spill over the stuff.This specific Orange color is bright and looks very nice on paper. The price is also quite right."
0,1,"These big bottles of paint are just great. Very reasonably priced. You can pour some out into a smaller pot keeping the paint in the big pot uncontaminated i.e. clean! The consistency is wonderful, not so thin that it runs everywhere but not so thick that it blobs on the page. It is just right :)This blue is quite dark so if you are looking for a more sky blue color then just add some white when you pour some into a smaller pot.Happy painting!"
1,0,"Love these markers! LOL I don't know if it's a good thing or not to get kids to sniff markers but the fruit smells of these are pretty good. The colors are nice and bright too.  I loved using these with my granddaughter to color with.We would draw something then smell it, then smell the marker. Had a lot of &#34;Oooo smell this color&#34; going on. We both had multi colored, polka dotted noses after using them! Good thing it washed off easily! :D"
0,1,I was happy to find these after my daughter requested &#34;smelly&#34; markers for Christmas.  I had these exact ones when I was a kid!
0,1,"Our little artists love these markers...more appropriate for four and older. They also love to make a mess, but the marker colors are easily removed from clothing in the wash."
1,0,"My kids love coloring, but not so much with crayons, so washable markers were in their stockings at christmas. Great selection of colors, and when the 2 yr old decides that coloring books are for suckers and her legs need some new patterns, its no big deal. A baby wipe takes it right off. Also when exuberant drawing gets on the hardwoods, again a baby wipe takes it right off.So, easy to use, easy to clean up, kids love them."
1,0,My 9-month-old son received these for Christmas. He loves them! He probably could have started using these a month ago. He doesn't understand the moving doors game yet but he loves spinning the wheels.
0,1,This is meant for a baby/toddler toy but I don't get why at all.  I had 3 different kids under 2 play with these and none of them could really push the head down when they were all stacked up.  The stickers also come off really easily and can be eaten by a small child.  My daughter ate part of one.  I don't think this toy was designed well.  Small hands can't really manipulate these.
0,1,These are great blocks for a slightly older toddler.  There is a lot to do and can keep my daughter busy for some time.  I think she got them a little too early (18 months) when she really needed softer ones so she wasn't a fan initially but she's come around now (20 months) and loves to play with them
0,1,These blocks are fun and entertaining.  I like how each block is different and can all be stacked together so that one of the little heads can be pushed down and make them all do something.  My 8 month old doesn't seem to understand the different features on these blocks yet and won't play with them together by himself.  He will pick one up to chew on.  These blocks appear to be very durable.
0,1,"I really like these blocks. They are the perfect size to grasp onto and are great since they have a lot of other uses. The sides of the blocks have many different activities for baby to play with so it doesn't get boring for children of small ages. Great toy for the money, I would totally recommended this to other parents."
0,1,"I bought these blocks for my son when he was approx. 7mo old.  He loved these things till close to his second birthday, although he lost interest a lot quicker than he did when he was younger. These blocks are super sturdy, they are a great buy for a child younger than one year."
0,1,Active 9 month old grandson loves putting the bucket inside each other and rolling them on the floor.
0,1,"I'm a big fan of the Ocean Wonders line of baby products, but these stacking pails aren't a huge hit in my house.  I bought them at the consignment store and am glad I didn't pay full price for them.  My daughter did, briefly, enjoy loading other toys into the largest of the three buckets...but she quickly realized that her empty margarine containers could hold more toys.This is a toy she abandoned pretty quickly.  It is cute to look at, but not a toy I would register for and not a toy I will buy as a gift for anyone."
0,1,"With a 2 year old who loves crane trucks, we have purchased a few. This one is, by far, the best quality and most durable one we have. I was a little nervous about how it would hold up over time, but we've had it for about a year now and it is still in great shape. Bruder products are expensive, but they are far superior to most of the other trucks you can get at Toys R Us and the like. If you're shopping for a crane truck, this is the one to buy."
0,1,"love the the toy .  the hook on the crane is heavy metal and works very well to hook onto things. It also anchors the string well and keeps it from flopping aroundI was worried about the cord getting tangled but the way it is threaded through the toy will prevent that from happeningall the knobs that operate the moving parts are bright red - was easy for my little guy to figure out how everything works by himself. they all make cranking noises when the knobs are turnedthe only thing that was a small drawback is that there is a gray arm that moves up and down.  It has a rubber part running down the middle, (like a rubber band) and it does not move up and down smoothly.  sometimes I have to turn the knob pretty hard.  Also I am worried about how the toy will work if the rubber band ever breaks."
0,1,Not at all like that stuff that comes from China.  This is a well build machine that my two year old boy actually sleeps with.  He LOVES this crane and play very rough with it and everything is just fine.  No breaks after 8 months of tough two year old love.  Too bad other toys are not this dependable or realistic.
0,1,"We gave this to our 4 year old for Christmas this year and he LOVES it! Seriously, he slept with this big crane in his bed one night. He plays with it throughout the day, it's the big hit from all the Christmas loot. I love that it's like a real crane and I don't have to hear a bunch of lights and sounds. He loves his Tonka toys of course, but this one gets two big thumbs up from us both. Definitely a wise purchase for the little boy in your life and we will buy more Bruder trucks for his 5th birthday."
0,1,I bought the dump truck and thought it was great then I bought the cement mixer and was disappointed.  I wish the doors would open so you could put a driver in the truck.  Also the plastic hook on the end of the water hose came off the very first time my grandson played with his truck.  I also thing the hose should be a little longer.
0,1,Any construction loving kid will be happy with this.  We haven't yet put water in it to make &#34;cement&#34; but from all glances looks like it won't have any problems functioning.  My son has about 10 Bruder products and all are doing fantastic against toddler destruction.  His father is blown away by the quality and quite often revisting his childhood with all the construction toys.  We've now resorted to buying Bruder toys for all kid birthday invites.
0,1,"Lauri toys are excellent for toddlers and preschoolers, and our little girl has had hours of fun with this set! The box for the Toddler Tote (which is used to store the toys) is a bit flimsier than some of their other sets. We had to tape ours back together not long after we started using it. The actual toy, however, has held up beautifully."
0,1,I have loved Lauri puzzles and toys since our child with a disability was young (years ago). This kit is the best of Lauri products in one small combination. We purchased this for our grandchild for use as a travel toy for a long trip. I especially love the small set of Lauri pegs and pegboard. She will especially love the cat puzzle.
0,1,"If you have a strong-willed child like mine who won't let you have a routine for him, you know by now that you need lots of activities to keep him entertained, so you can keep from going insane!I was looking for calm, sit-down activities for my son to do before bed.  He LOVES this.  Sorting out and finding the colors and shapes he needs to make his picture is therapeutic and calming for him.  At bedtime he also like the Silly Faces Stick-Ons Game, his Story Reader, and his mama simply reading books to him.  I just never know what he'll accept but the point is to get him in bed in a cooperative, well-adjusted manner and quiet activities like these help.The only thing I would recommend for Melissa & Doug is for them to create better storage for their products.  We also have the food cutting set, which all the pieces are sitting in an open ""food"" crate.  It's cute but not practical.  I want to be able to stack things and not have everything fall out if it tips over.  And also for THIS game, I really have to be careful because the boards and the pieces are all just sitting there open-faced ready to be knocked over.  It should at least have some kind of top to put on it, Tupperware-style.  I have two other babies and I worry that if I dropped it the small pieces for this game might land in places that only little babies could possibly find!"
0,1,The only reason for not a five star is that I think the company should have included a sliding panel lid for the box.The pieces fit together with near perfection and all is excellent quality.
1,0,"My son has so much fun with these! Well made, fun designs and bold colors! Great for many different reasons!"
1,0,"this is really a nice toy that is enjoyed by the kids and seems to be educational as well.  I gave it to my granddaughter and the other kids (who got puzzles of their own, which were more age appropriate) got excited as well.  A good time was had by all! looks pretty sturdy."
0,1,"But then, after about 2 months, even my youngest, then 5 (who is autistic), got bored with the pattern boards.  Would be better if there were multiple cards provided with the set and a plain board for kid to then copy the patterns to."
0,1,"Too many pieces and without a lid. The puzzles are very hard to get out. I have to squeeze my finger between the puzzle and the box to get 1 or 2 at a time out. My 3 year old likes to dump the pieces and start a puzzle, but it's more of a hassle with clean up than any other Melissa and Doug puzzle I own (We have a lot). This is not a traditional puzzle where the pieces go into an indented piece of wood. The pieces slide around. My daughter is very proud of herself when she does these, but I feel the company could have put better effort into this one."
1,0,"I loved pattern blocks as a kid.  I remember playing with them in school and there were a ton of them.  I never had a board or anything, just pushed them together, made designs.We got this for my son when he was 4.  It's all right...  but I see there is a bucket with twice as many blocks (plastic) available on Amazon for the same price.  No boards.  I think that would be the better way to go.  More blocks would be more fun - the boards are OK but more blocks would be better.What really bugs me about this set, though, is there's no way to really keep it all together.  It came with just a floppy flimsy plastic cover that didn't stay on - it just laid over the box.  So you have this solid wooden box with loose pattern tiles flopping around in one side.  We got my niece the M&D; cutting board & food set when she was 2 or so, and later bought the same for my son when he was 2 or 3.  My nieces came with a heavy plexiglass sliding cover - my son's came with no cover.  I think that M&D; have kind of cheaped out on packaging over the years.  This should really have a heavy plastic sliding cover - it would make it so much nicer.  We got rid of the flimsy plastic cover and I keep the tiles in a cloth drawstring bag - it's really akward though.  I guess if you have shelves for toys it's not so bad but we tend to shove everything in drawers.Anyway - all in all I guess this is just OK.  I think you're better off going for just the tiles, in a bigger assortment."
0,1,"I love the wooden pattern blocks over the magnet ones.  I love that the pictures are also wooden, makes everything durable.  Wish there was a lid, but the blocks stay in place most of the time.  My kids love to play with these.  There are many more patterns you can find online for free."
1,0,"We have a different morning activity everyday. These pattern boards are one morning a week. We say, &#34;OK, shape day!&#34; and she gets so excited. She is now at the point of saying each color and shape. She makes her own creations with the shapes but also loves the boards. I keep it out for an hour and then put it back. This keeps it as a special activity and not just a toy that gets taken for granted. We are happy with the quality. The only thing, however, is that the partition where the boards are kept is SO tiny that it's hard to get the boards out. I have to use a thin pen to get in there or risk dumping the shape pieces out on the floor. That's the only frustrating part."
0,1,"Great puzzle. I set up a station of different types of puzzles and art stations for a three year old birthday. It went over great with parents and kids...This one is a little tougher than others and helps build fine motor skills.That said. You HAVE to put it away every time. If you slack off, you will end up with these pieces everywhere. Of course, it is easy to use even with a few missing pieces and easy to just add them back to the set as you find them."
0,1,great toy! my two year old loves sitting there playing with it. great for fine motor skills. the holes in the beads are big enough for her to get the lace through and she had a great time with it. very good quality and sturdy.
0,1,"This is a great set and helps improve fine motor skills. I do have a few complaints, however. First, the inside of the beads is not sanded which can make it difficult for the little ones to get the string thoroughly the block.  To compensate for this they made the whole in the blocks bigger, which brings me to problem number two.  The holes are to big in the blocks.  Even if you tie a knot in the end of the string the locks still slide off the end. Problem number three is the case. It works alright, but it doesn't hold the blocks in very well when you want to put them up."
0,1,"Love the Melissa and Doug wooden beads; use with students for patterns, colors, and fine motor; they are a classic."
0,1,"These beads are wonderful for little ones to thread on the extra long laces or for color recognition, sorting stacking counting, etc!  Our 2.5 yr old boys love them!!"
0,1,"Grandson, 2 can do this with help but hole in center not quite big enough for him to tread with out help. Loves to wear them strung like a noisy necklace however.  Maybe if threader had long wood needle on end that would help."
0,1,This set lets your imagination go. With the great quality and excellent construction you can't go wrong with any melissa and doug product!! Made our restaurant complete.
0,1,"We love every toy we get from Melissa and Doug.  They are quality toys without all the flash and noise.  These particular toys are made very well.  The paint is colorful and engaging.  My little ones, 1 and 3, boy and girl, love making these sandwiches. The velcro works again and again no issues.  They've played with this toy and other toys from Melissa and Doug for some time without growing bored.  Love their toys."
0,1,"My grandchildren LOVE the Melissa and Doug Wooden Sandwich-making Set!  GREAT toy..and being Melissa and Doug..it will be in fine condition for THEIR children!It's fun watching them put all the condiments on their sandwiches, just as if they were real sandwiches!  The pieces are large enough to not worry swallowing them..and being wooden, they are quite indestructable!I highly recommend almost everything that is Melissa and Doug."
0,1,"This wood sandwich kit is as sturdy and durable as they come.  Excellent quality toy, and it gets 5 stars for that.  I bought this for my daughter at 18 months.. she is now 22 months.  She has loved it from the beginning.  Have some drawbacks though:-  My daughter absolutely LOVES ""cutting"" the sandwich and hamburger.. but thats about it.  She doesnt quite get the concept of making a sandwich, which means I have to put all the pieces together.. and she takes them all apart with the wooden knife.-  There's only so many sandwiches you can make with this kit!  It would be nice to have more meats.. and fillings, but thats okay I suppose.-  The velcro is starting to wear down.  I have this issue with the food cutting set as well - my daughter plays with this toy so often (""cutting"" the sandwich), that the velcro is starting to lose its adhesiveness.  So I question how long this toy will last if we've only had it for 5 months.. and its already started to wear down like this.Overall, excellent toy, I highly recommend it - my daughter loves to cut the sandwiches, so it provides excellent playing time for her.  It keeps her busy for a long time.. and she loves just loves this toy."
1,0,"My kids - 1, 3, and 5 - all love playing with this and many other Melissa & Doug kitchen toys. They love the Velcro and the wooden knives to 'cut' the bread (& other food) and serving 'custom' sandwiches since you can choose the toppings you stick together. I love that these are durable and made of wood and brightly painted."
0,1,"My 3yr old loves to make sandwiches with this set. Keeps her very entertained, which makes mommy very happy...lol. Stays together nicely but also easy for her to pull apart."
0,1,"We've had this toy for a few years now and it has held up so well!  It has been well played with but looks almost new!  We bought it when my son was a preschooler and now his little sister can play with it!  We've had many ""picnics"" in our living room with this toy! A good buy!"
0,1,"Can't say enough about this kitchen set.I love how it fits nicely up along the wall( like a bookshelf),and doesn't seem to take up too much floor space.I love all the storage areas in it.The stove making boiling/cooking sounds when batteries are installed is very intertaining to the kids, they use this function all the time.The removable baskets in it are always being loaded up and carried around.This is holding up really well in a daycare setting with 5 children between 2 and 4yrs using it on a regular basis.The best kitchen I have had in my toy room. over the past 15years, This is the 3rd one I have had. We have had this one for around a year now."
1,0,"After going to my nieces house we found that we really should get our then 18 month old twin boys their own kitchen. I left it up to my husband to come back with the perfect one, when he and the boys came back, he brought THIS ONE. I was shocked, the biggest and most expensive one out there, but it really is great and my now 20 month olds love it* Its so real looking, and NON-GENDER SPECIFIC!* The little mural in the window is adorable* It fits okay in a spot near the phone in our kitchen, really big though, we had to move the dog bowls. I wouldnt recomend it if you dont have alot of space* Has alot of storage, the fridge, stove, dishwasher, dishrack, baskets cabinets and a microwave! Holds ALL of our food and dishes* It has every accesory available, dishwasher, coffe maker, microwave, stove, oven, refridgerator, double sink, telephone and storage* The refridgerator even has an ice maker just like the real one in our kitchen* Theres enough room for my twins and their friends to ALL play* Very durable and easy to clean* Has a cute little light that my sons LOVE* Makes a few noises, though I didnt want one that made too many, they should really use their imagination* Comes with some food, dishes and utenzils, but I do recomend you purchasing extras* It actually has some counter space, one of the only kitchens that did* Its a kitchen to last!We love it, and though its a bit more expensive, it doesnt look so corny and it will last for YEARS... our sons play with it EVERY day"
0,1,"I just bought this for my 4 year old and 1 year old daughters.  Last christmas I bought the Disney Princess kitchen and spent $60, the year before that I bought the Little Tikes tender heart kitchen and spent $40 - both of them are garbage.  They break easily and weren't worth the money.  I figured if I wanted to get something nice for the both of them you're better off spending a little more.  Just a note though, if you buy direct you get free shipping on this until 12/31 and it's still in stock for Christmas.  I will let you know how it is when I receive it next week...I can't wait to play with it!!UPDATE 12/12/05 -We ordered this last Wednesday, and it came on Friday.  It took us a long time to put it together about 2 1/2 hours.  Put the stickers on before you try to assemble it, you'll be glad you did.  I think this was worth the money.  My only complaints - the sounds are not very realistic at all, and the cupboard doors are poorly made and don't fit as nicely as they should.  But the shipping time was excellent, plus I got free shipping which made it even better.  I looked at the regular one at Toys R Us, and that one would be fine if you only have 1 child.  With the Deluxe one there is plenty of room for 2 or 3 kids to play together.  There is extra storage space, counter space, and the dishwasher.  For an extra $50, you're better off with the deluxe kitchen.UPDATE 12/27Huge hit - the girls loved it,  we kept this in the kitchen.  They opened all the presents and their stockings and then we surprised them in the kitchen with this.  They were estatic!! It has been more of a hit with our 1 year old than our 4 year old, only because she was busy with all her other toys.  The look on their faces was worth every penny."
0,1,"This is a cross between the classics chess, checkers, or tic-tac-toe. In the game players gain spacial skills playing their pieces. Fewer colors help keep it simple. Rules are basic enough for most young ones to grasp!"
0,1,"I bought this doll for my 2-1/2 year old a couple months ago and she loves it. Honestly I think she is more into the fact that it's DORA than the fact that it talks. Although she does really like that one of it's phrases is ""swiper no swiping"". That cracks her up. The product description by the vendor is pretty accurate. The clothes are different than the Dora on the show but my daughter doesn't seem to mind. The backpack does come off the Dora and the added ""surprise"" inside is fun for my daughter to play with. She was thrilled about the bracelet that comes with the doll but it drives me nuts. It's opening is too wide for such a small piece so it falls off my daughter all the time; I'm sure it will be lost soon. The hair on the doll gets messy quickly and we haven't figured out a way to clean it up but all in all: It's really cute, kids love that it talks (and like the other reviews said it's just the right volume level), and it's a MUST have for a little Dora fan!"
0,1,"I shopped around for a Dora doll for my Dora obsessed 2 year old for a while and decided on this one- I'm really happy with it. The sayings are cute and so is Dora. I like that she has a removable backpack with a surprise and the bracelet for the kid, and that she has a soft body This toy is going to be around for a while!"
1,0,My two year old daughter LOVES Dora the Explorer so it was only natural she got this as a Christmas gift.  She was so excited when she opened it and give her a big hug!  The doll is nicely made and ours included the camera.  My daughter has so much fun playing with her and it was definitely a great gift.

0,1,"I was going to buy this one but went with another with the Deluxe take along swing also from Fisher Prize cause this one seems to be very light and can easily just tilt over or if the babies try to reach for the toys it'll go forward with them.  The Deluxe Take Along Swing don't do that.Martha, NYC"
0,1,This was another of our shower gifts. I wound up getting three bouncers. This was not used very much in my house as an infant bouncer. I had another bouncer with music which my baby prefered to the fisher price.Pros:It adjusts to fit your baby's growthIt is sturdyAttractive if you like bright colorsCons:Battery eaterNo music!!!Toy bar kind of boring...I would recommend that you look at other bouncers before purchasing this one.
0,1,"One thing I really like about this toy, is that they included the wheelchair.  I love how the Little People toys can also educate children about the differences in people."
0,1,"my daughter got this for christmas and she loves to bang on it to make it sound!  we stand her at it and she gets the idea of it, but she's not quite ready (7 months old).  she loves the bright yellow smiley face on and loves to spin the other toys as well.  this is a great buy!"
0,1,"I bought this for my son when he was 5 months old.  He was interested in it when it was an activity table, but not as a walker.I bought this on the local economy (I live overseas) and was glad to read that other people had the same problems with it that we did.  It is too flimsy and not good for new walkers.  It would probably be okay for a child who is not using it to pull up and walks well on their own.  My son falls everytime he tries to use it and has given up.The ball worked for us when spun, but it stopped working completely after about 2 months.  We cannot return it to the store as the country we live in does not have good consumer laws.  My next step is to write to Fisher Price to complain about this problem.We have a lot of Fisher Price toys and have been happy with most of them.  I would only recommend that you read the reviews first."
0,1,"There is nothing good I can say about this toy. We bought it when our son was 6mths old and at 12mths he still would pick anything in the entire house before this!Also it is dangerous!!! Our son was pushing it out of his way to get to another toy and it fell forward and he fell onto it. Well he was stuck in between the wheels on the back side. Thank goodness he is always with us and we caught it immediatly. Very scary, he could not move or get out of it.It is now in the trash. Save your money and get the hungry hippo by fisher price."

1,0,"My daughter's 2 1/2 years old now and still has fun sorting the blocks into shape, color, and ""group"" categories.  I think this toy was a great aid in helping her understand these fundamentals."
0,1,"This toy (as long as you don't lose peices) should last you a lifetime.  The peices are very well made hard plastic.  My 1-year old rec'd this for his birthday.  Right now he enjoys throwing the peices around the room, but I can see how he will be able to grow into it.  I plan on getting the expansion packages w/ hippos, alligators, and panda bears."
0,1,"My daughter loves this toy-she's very much into sorting right now and loves to pick out the pairs and put them in the ark.The animals themselves are very nice and durable. The ark seems a little flimsy-it pops apart very easily and makes it hard to play sometimes. It's also a little small-you can't fit a pair of animals in the ""stalls""-it would be nice if the ark were larger. Also most of the animals don't fit inside the door when you march them up the ramp-it isn't tall enough. It's still a great-and much played with toy in our house-it just doesn't seem as durable as the other little people toys."
0,1,My 2 year old daughter Loves to swing and this is great -we even put it lower so she get in it herself - the harness is great for keeping them from falling out
0,1,"My daugher loves to fill this minivan up with all kinds of Pooh characters, little people and animals, bottles, well....anything she wants to haul.  She runs this back and forth across the living room!  And it makes some fun sounds.  It is alittle snug trying to get people in the front seat - but I feel this is a safe toy for her and she loves it.Good value for the money and it gets played with alot!"
0,1,This has become one of my favorite toys. My daughter just turned 1 and she adores it. it comes with the mother and a baby in a car seat as well as her stroller. The van has eyes which move when the wheels spin and you can honk the horn. It also palys the music to If You're Happy And You Know It.... when the horn is honked again. It does seem a bit loud but it plays for only a short time when pressed. My daughter can't fit them in properly yet but she gets them in the car and pushes it around anyway. I love this toy because it is one of the few for children her age that lets her use her imagination. I will be picking up the Little People Zoo or Barn next since my daughter loves animals. This toy is durable and easy to clean. It can also be taken everywhere since it is a good size to carry along. The only thing that bothers me is that my daughter always throws the mom on the floor and plays with the baby. Is she trying to tell me something ;-))??
1,0,I just got this in the mail today; a Christmas gift for our daughter.  And what little I could play with it without taking it out of the package is just too cute!!!  Looks like it will hold up just as well as the house we have already.  I can't wait for Christmas so we can play with this. I was able to get it at Kmart.com if you are having trouble locating one.
0,1,I received this 2 days ago and upon opening the shipping box I was shocked and very upset to learn that the bed of the dump truck was missing (kind of the purpose for the toy).  After contacting the seller immediantly I was informed that I would get a full refund and could keep the defective toy.  Curious to see how my 3 year old son reacts to a bedless dump truck for his birthday.
0,1,I got this for my son when he was 8 months old. He loves to push things around and esp. loves anything w/ wheels. It's so fun watching push it around. He's figured out it makes sounds. It's just perfect for little kids. We love Little People toys.
0,1,"Our 11 month old son received this for Christmas and, wow, what a great truck!1. Love that the ladder moves up and down and can fit both the firedog and the fireman.2. Eyes move when it drives- cute.3. Nice fire truck sounds.4. Both our kids love to make it drive forward.We rotate toys and this firetruck has turned out to the favorite of all our trucks and cars.  It's the one the kids keep going back for!"
0,1,"I have to admit I thought they could have made more of an effort to have the ropes equal before shipping. When I got my swing, one side was about 2 feet and the other about 5 feet. I spent an hour trying to equal the ropes on both sides and finally gave up and put the swing back in the box. The next day I put both feet on the swing and pulled the short end of the rope with both hands and finally got the two back ends equal. Once I did that, the swing hands beautifully. I don't think it can fall over backward, as I've read here, not if it's hanging properly. I also found the try very easy to release, just reach under the try on both sides and pull the plastic locking pieces so that they unlock and the try pops up so you can pull it up the rope and swing it away.. The swing itself is very sturdy, had a lot of room for baby or toddler and the harness is easy to snap together.. I hung the two attached hooks to an old chain I had already attached to a tree. I'm more worried about the old chain than I am about this swing. I can't believe the others are selling for so much money. This is sure as good as any I've seen and a lot less expensive. If it had come with the ropes a little more equal on both sides, I'd have given it five stars. Personally, I don't get the negative comments, especially the security issues. Unless there is something wrong with the swing and/or the ropes, I just don't see how it could tip over. I tried to see if I could get it to tip or twist (before putting baby in it) and I couldn't. The ropes in the back are shorter than the ropes in the front and the back of the chair is higher than the front, I just don't see how it could tip if it's locked into place in the back like it's suppose to be and the ropes are as shown. I'd recommend it, and I'm using it for my grandson."
0,1,I bought one for my first grandson as a baby--he still loves to use it  at age 3 and it made it easy for me to decide to get one for his cousin who will join our family this spring.  Sturdy and safe. I like the tray option.  It also has a safety strap.
0,1,"My child loves this seat. My only issue is that the ropes were uneven and we had to take the back pannel off of the swing to adjust the rope length. This took a screwdriver, 15 minutes, and some muscle to shift the rope. Other than that, it was super easy to install."
0,1,i have been wanting a swing for outside. cant wait to use it when the weather warms up....i now have two grandchildren and i know they will love swinging ourdoors.....
0,1,Great product.  High quality.  Very sturdy.  Excellent value.  Would recommend to a friend.  Gets two thumbs up.  Make sure you have a good tree/area to hang it from.
0,1,This is a large inflatable that easily held several 5-6 yr olds for floating fun. It was a party hit!!!
0,1,"I received this activity center at my baby shower for my daughter.  It was a total surprise since I hadn't asked for one.  I am so glad that I received this center!My daughter started to play with this at 11 months old.  She absolutely loved it.  The music was perfect for her - not too loud or too soft.  Except for 1 piece that the child is supposed to lift up (too hard to do even for a mommy!), the movable parts are great.We never put this toy into her crib so I can't say whether or not it's appropriate.  We played with this in the mornings as part of her routine.  She really enjoyed it & missed it when I finally donated it to another baby."
1,0,"This is such a fun game, we play it all the time.  Our family has 4 children, the smallest are 3 & 5 years old.  They both can play and enjoy the game.  Although it is easy to understand, it is a good game for encouraging planning and strategic moves.  I highly recommend this game for lots of family fun."
0,1,"I have had this for over 2 years and for the price, it is one of the top toys in our house.  I originally wrote the review when I had a 2 yr old and a baby (both boys).  Now I have a 2 and 4 year old. The music is loud and like another reviewer said, it sounds like a loud vacuum.  This is a go-to toy for both of my boys and for any visiting children.  I can't believe the use I've gotten out of this toy.  The only bad thing is that both of my boys at the age of 2 like to put other toys and items in the chute.  This creates a blockage and we have to stop everything to get it out.  Usually isn't a problem.  I just turn it upside down and shake it out or turn it on for some extra pressure, turn it upside down and take off the top part of the ramp.  We've had a lot of other things down that chute and have been able to get it all out. And as for durability, we have carried it and dropped it and dropped it and dropped it and it's still working great.  If the balls stop coming out of the chute, it may be time to change batteries or just reduce the balls to 2 or 3 and you can get more use out of the batteries.  Doesn't take as much power to shoot 2 or 3 balls out."
1,0,"My son got this for his first birthday. He was a little afraid of it because it is noisy, but after a while he got used to it.  The balls do pop out of the toy and you have to chase them down, but it is fun anyway.  The balls are colorful and easy to find under couches.  :)  The plunger is easy for a kid to press.We used this for well over a year before stowing it away during a move.  We unearthed it a month ago for my second son to use (he's almost a year now) and although he doesn't actually play with the toy as intended, he does enjoy the balls popping all over the place and was not scared at all.My now four year old son does all the ball chasing for him, and it's a good way to keep them playing together and happy.  Also, the batteries seem to last quite a reasonable while in this toy."
1,0,"My kids (1 and 3) had tremendous fun with this toy, but it is very power-hungry.  We'd change out the batteries and one week later it would be flat again.  The surge of air that pushes the balls out just takes a lot of power.  Other than that, it's great fun.  The music isn't too annoying, and my kids loved chasing after the balls as they shot out of the toy.  I'd instruct your children not to peer into the ball shoot, however, as my daughter twice has gotten tagged in the eye as the balls came out."
1,0,"We got this as a gift when my baby was born, he started taking an interest in it when he was around 10 months old.  After a few months of use the motor that blows air and makes the balls pop up has gone kaput.  So you can press the red lever to start the music but that's about it.  Thankfully the baby was pretty easygoing about it and just has fun playing with the balls, they're the perfect size for his little hands.  I sure wish they could make things to last longer, I'd be willing to pay more for something that will last more than a few months."
0,1,"Our twins liked the multi colored balls that came with this toy (at 2 years old they still like the balls) but never got into the toy itself, nor did I. I thought this was interesting given how many other people here seemed to have fantastic experiences with the ball popper."
1,0,"Our 20 month old played with this at a friend's house and didn't want to put it away, which is not like her since she bores easily with most toys.  We purchased one for her and the moment she sets it down to play, her face lights up, she squeals with delight when she presses the big red ball to start the action, and then once the balls start popping in the air, she is overjoyed.The colorful balls are placed in the chute on top of the unit, then as they slide down the ramp, the air popper forces them up through the top hole and they pop around like popcorn!  We watch our daughter laugh and have a blast with this toy all the time, but she is learning so much from it as well.  First she learned cause and effect when pushing the red lever to start the machine.  She learned that the music will not start until the balls begin moving.  Next she learned where to place the balls, and how to catch them if they scooted away, and finally she learned words like BALL, STOP, OUT, PLAY, DANCE just from the repetition of the activities.  The fun music reminds me of a circus parade and several songs randomly play while the popper is activated.Storage is a snap since it's heavy enough to stay upright while playing, and light enough to grab and go when it's time to clean up.  There are three main pieces that an adult has to screw together, and though a child might be able to pry off the top piece, it easily snaps back into place.  Just don't lift it from the top piece and you shouldn't have a problem.I recommend this toy for babies who are able to sit up unassisted so that an adult can help them play with the balls, but highly recommend it for walking toddlers since they will love chasing after the balls.A+ from this parent on this one!"
0,1,"Unfortunately, I don't remember purchasing these.  It was probably several years ago.  I have 9 grandbabies under 9yo.  No issues reported to me."
1,0,"This toy has been such an enormous hit at our house, it's hard to complain about it:  we have children ranging from age 1 to age 7, and they ALL play with it, with great delight.  BUT, it's so LOUD!  It's like running a hair dryer or air popcorn popper, plus the frantic music and silly noises.  It drives me nuts after about thirty seconds.  But they LOVE it.  I guess I'd call this a ""play with it in your room with the door closed while Mommy puts a wet washcloth on her forehead"" toy:  worth every single penny, but a parental love sacrifice to allow it in the house."
0,1,"We got this toy for our baby to ""grow"" into... but it seems that each of her older brothers has played with it more than she ever can. The music plays so loud and fast that it stresses me out listening to it. I wonder if it might be overstimulation for the baby. It plays songs like ""flight of the bumble bee"" and ""pop goes the weasle"" (among other songs) I was going to discontect the sound wires, but I think the music is there too cover up the noise the motor makes. The balls are fun to watch, going around and around. I would say there is more fun to this toy than learning, but then again, all play is some type of learning, right? I would suggest you go to the Hasbro site and order replacement balls right away, they get lost quickly and it doesn't work right without all 5 balls. It is $4 for a pack of 5 balls."
0,1,"My one year old LOVES this toy!! We haven't had any problems with it either. It's loud, but it's a kid's toy, they're all loud and my kid is even louder. So, we love it, he loves it, his friends love it, I would totally recommend it."
1,0,"I got this for my 2 year old.  Both he and his 4 year old brother found it entertaining.  It is also good practice for little ones to place an object into a small hole (fine motor skills).  Problems with it though:  my 2 year old, who still chews on things. promptly destroyed all the balls. This toy is intended for babies and babies mouth their toys, so I think the balls should have been able to handle it.  This toy is also loud without volume control.  Heads up--takes 4 D batteries that aren't included."
1,0,"This toy is fun and includes quite a bit of exercise.  Some of the balls go rolling off and the baby loves chasing them and bringing them back and watching them go all around, dancing around to the music the whole time.  Great fun and great value all the way around."
0,1,"It is loud, but so are a lot of toys. Our son likes to play with it (he is a little over a year old) but he doesn't usually play with it for very long, and he doesn't play with it very often. It spends a lot of time on the shelf.The version we have is made up of a base, the long slide, and the thing on top. If he tries to pick it up, it comes apart. It snaps back together pretty easily. Since you are looking at in online I thought I'd add that in."
0,1,"Both boys figured out very quickly how to make the balls pop out and they were crawling fast to get them and put them back in the toy.Eight months later, they still play with the toy and think it is so much fun.They learned to put the balls on the ramp and where to push in order to get them to pop out -- in minutes. They now know that you can't put everything into the holes and make it work.Highly recommended."
0,1,"My son requested this for Christmas of 2003. We purchased it from amazon and put it away for christmas since christmas was still a few months away. Christmas morning I couldn't belive when we took it out of the box and pieces were missing. We didn't even get the right feet. Literally! Our game came with two left feet not a right foot. There wasn't enough pieces to get him put together correctly so we figured we would put batteries in it just to see what the game sounded like. Surprise the game didn't even turn on. What a piece of junk. My son really wanted another one, but we explained the value (...) and that he would be better off trying a different toy."
0,1,"I bought this toy for my three year old and for my three daycare children.We played it the first day and it worked great and they absolutely loved it.However, and this is the bad thing, unless you are willing to put out the money for new batteries each and every time you use it, then don't buy it.  The batteries seem wear down after just a half hour of use.  I would recomend rechargeable batteries for this toy.  I was very disapointed."
1,0,"My three year old son saw this advertised and asked for it as a present - the only time he has ever done this for any game or toy.The game comes with:* Large blue elephant fan base and translucent plastic trunk* Thirty rip-stop nylon butterflies* Several butterfly markers for keeping score* Four mesh nets for catching butterfliesThe unit requires 4 ""C"" batteries (not included.)When powered on, a quiet fan in the elephant base pushes air up the elephant's trunk forcing the butterflies out. Players try to catch the butterflies in their nets. Our family has played this game and enjoyed it. Catching the randomly fluttering butterflies is an excellent eye-hand coordination activity. And even though the game is geared for younger kids, there is enough of a challenge that all ages can play and enjoy it. (One of the nicest things about the game is that it really does not matter who wins, the game play is fun enough in itself. We don't even keep score and no one minds.)Elefun is not without its issues, though:1. Plays quickly, but then it takes considerably more time to get it ready for the next round of play than it takes to actually play.2. The trunk has to be extended manually even with the fan on at the beginning of play. Once fully extended, it will stay up.3. Eats batteries like mad. The fan works best with fresh batteries and the quality of play goes down quickly (not all the butterflies will come out) if the batteries are not 100%. A DC adapter option would have been nice.4. While the entire set is durable, the trunk is a bit suspect. Made out of a plastic a bit thicker than a plastic garbage bag, it is subject to holes as it gets repeatedly crinkled during normal play. Our son inexplicably took a scissors to it, but fortunately it was repairable (though we lost a bit of length.)All things considered, the game is fun and a good activity for young children. What kind of value it is for the money is debatable - a friend gave us this game, so it's a win-win for us. Batteries are an issue, however, and I would seriously recommend purchasing a big set of rechargeables anyway for any parent who buys battery-reliant toys. Considering how fast you'll use up batteries with Elefun, you'll save money in the long run if you do so."
0,1,"We purchased this game about a year ago and all the kids here enjoy playing it ... Ages 3 through 10.  It's challenging enough for the older kids to catch the falling butterflies and easy enough for the little ones to gather them up off the floor.  We've had great times with this game and it's quick enough that those with short attention spans can finish the game without upsetting the rest who still want to play.  I've found that the batteries even last quite a while in this one, which is unusual for games of this nature.  The only trouble that I've found with this game is; sometimes the butterflies come out in larger groups rather than a couple at a time."
0,1,What a great game for pre-schoolers! We love this game at my house. My 7 year old still enjoys it and my 2 year old goes crazy for it!
0,1,My son recieved this chair as a birthday gift.  We already owned a similar chair but this one seemed so much nicer.  We were thrilled to recieve it until we actually used it.  It is very difficult to clean.  Food gets trapped in the little holed and even when we shake it out some food remains trapped.  My husband takes it outside and runs the hose through the little holes near the straps and that usually does the trick.  After he hoses it out we leave it in the garage overnight to dry.  Keep in mind that if you purchase this chair this is a every night routine that you can look forward to.  Prior to recieving this chair we were using a Fisher Price chair that was not nearly as attractive.  We bought it for 10.00 at Kmart.  The 10.00 Kmart chair actually comes apart and can be put in the dishwasher which makes cleaning up as easy as can be.  As for this chair do not waste your money.  More expensive is not always better and this chair is proof of that.
0,1,"I recieved this chair as a gift with my first child 4 years ago and now am using it with my second baby.  I like this chair because we live in an apartment and I don't have room to put a high chair in the dining room, so for a family of four, this chair is great because it straps to one of the chairs.  It reclines pretty far so that's good.  There are some minor flaws, such as cleaning is a pain.  After every feeding, I have to move the seat part and clean the food particles that get stuck in the little areas that are hard to get too, so that's a bit time consuming.  Overall it's a great chair and is good if you don't have room for a full size high chair."
1,0,"My kids have this set, and I give it as a gift whenever I can. Its great, a great price, well-made, colorful, useful, handy, just perfect."
0,1,"My 2 year old grandson LOVES to help anyone with anything.  If we are outside working with a rake, hoe etc, this set is perfect.  They are kid sized and so well made.  Handles are a smooth wood; no chance of splinters in the little hands.  I see them lasting until he's too old to use them anymore.  Great value for the price."
1,0,super cute- seemingly durable versions of the adult tools. My daughter cannot wait to have our garden this year so she can help!!
0,1,"These are REAL tools for real little helpers!  Solid metal tools are totally functional, small versions of real tools just like mom and dad's.  The bright colors are appealing and solid enamel.  The handles are nice smooth beech, strong but light, with nice leather hangers.  These tools are sized for 4-10 year olds, although our toddler loves to help out and can easily handle these.  While these tools can't be sharpened without losing their enamel, they are sharp enough to really use to shovel dirt or hoe in the garden and be effective.  We look forward to showing our little one how to use her tools to keep her own garden neat and tidy and to plant her veggies and flowers."
0,1,We had just completed our second season with this tools and they are still in great shape. Grampa's helpers put them through quite a workout.  It's nice to have something that doesn't fall apart after a few uses.
1,0,I bought these for my grandson for Christmas.  He likes to be out in the yard when his grandfather is working.  Everyone was really taken by how realistic these look and how well made they are.  They will make any child feel like a big helper!
0,1,"I didn't like it. Really involved and I didn't realize at the time of purchase it was so. But the kit itself was cool, I just didn't have the patience for it."
0,1,I gave this doll to my adult daughter when she was expecting. it was a huge hit at the baby shower ! All the adults there wanted to deliver the  doll's baby.It helped my daughter feel a lot better about being so huge while pregnant. Now the doll is waiting for my granddaughter to be old enough to play with her.
0,1,"This is not recommended for children under three except with parental supervision.  Definitely, play with this doll with your little one.Education:  If a second or third is on the way, this is one of the best teaching tools to show toddlers where the baby develops, and how mommy's tummy gets big then goes flat after the baby is born.  The bond between mother and child can easily be seen, and kids can relate it to themselves, making the connection quite easily.  I've seen this Midge and Baby Doll make a big difference in how the first child accepts the second.Fun:  The belly is held on with magnets, so Midge can be either a sassy chick or a new mom-to-be.  The kids enjoy the baby doll and all the special ""Happy Family"" accessories that are available.  Truly, this is fun for kids.Durable:  Like all dolls who are played with her pristine condition will change with happy fingers; generally, kids take the shoes off first.  Mattel makes children's toys to be played with, as opposed to the Collector's editions.  They will last; some will lose fingers to teething tots, but the joy of getting to that point is certainly worth this very low price.Why was there such a fuss among so many shops - actually pulling the pregnant Midge off the shelf?  That does seem silly, doesn't it?  But the ruckus was real.  Congratulations to the brave storeowners who decided that this doll was a doll, not a controversy.Since pregnancy is a normal state before a child enters the world, take advantage of every tool possible to teach a two-year-old about the new baby that will come and alter their life.  Set up a happy family with mom, dad, brother, baby, and now grandparents.Victoria Tarrani"
0,1,bought for my grandaughter whose dad was on deployment and she would hug it and tell him no matter where he is she loves him.
0,1,PrettyEasy puzzle finished in 15 min  by 6 yr old girlsThey finish the Castel with great skill go girls
0,1,My 3 yr old grandson love his BIG RED FIRE ENGINE! It is the first thing he run to play with when he come to my house. The pieces are big and sturdy hard to bend cause he is all boy....rough on his toys. I love the colors and details. He was able to put it together by hisself after the first time with a little help from me.....love it!!!
1,0,"I wouldn't hesitate if I were you.  I bought 3 in total.  One for my granddaughter and one for my grandson.......they are 3 1/2 and almost 3, respectively!  They simple can't get enough of putting this puzzle together!!  Grandma has become an expert too!!  The 3rd puzzle I donated to a pre-bone marrow benefit that will be held soon.  Some lucky child will get to love it too.  Wish Melissa and  Doug had other 4 foot long puzzles of other cars or animals.  With only 24 pieces, it is just the right size!  Love it!!  If there was a ten, I would have marked that box!!!!"
0,1,"This is a great puzzle, vibrant, durable, fun.  The only problem is that if you are on carpet, the pieces don't hold together super well.  This is easily remedied by putting down cardboard or something harder, or use on a harder surface, but it is something to think about."
0,1,This was a Birthday Gift for my grandson.  He loved it.  He played with it with his friends.  They all had a vry good time with it.
0,1,"This was the first Melissa and Doug toy I bought for my 3 year old.  I was very pleased that she mastered it by herself after us only working on it with her 1 time.  The pieces are large and durable.  They go together easily and the colors are bright.  Each piece is very recognizable as to where it goes, no ambiguous pieces.  The puzzle is not square so it did not give me the opportunity to teach her about starting with the edge pieces, but she just starts with the animal piece she finds first and builds.  This puzzle just reminded me once again that I underestimate her abilities at such a young age!"
1,0,"My grandkids LOVE this puzzle and put it together often, sometimes several times a day. The pieces are large and sturdy- to be expected from Melissa and Dave."
0,1,"When daddy barbques, we make sure our kids are far away from the flame...but now, thanks to Little Tikes BBQ Grill and Glow, they can cook up their own feast right there in our backyard or living room!  Complete with authentic sizzling sounds, glowing ""coal"" and a grill cover, this adorable toy has kept our kids happy for longer than most other pretend toys.It's all around great fun, well made, brightly colored, and great value.  Includes lots of cute accessories like corn on the cob, chicken, burgers and buns.Just keep this out of the sun and rain for long periods of time -- our neighbor kept theirs in the yard and before the year was out the toy had faded.  It's fun indoors or out, and since it's light and on wheels, it's easily moveable.SIDE NOTE:  I forgot to mention that when we first brought this toy home brand new, the grill cover was defective and kept popping off the grill, so a quick call to customer service and they put us on the list to replace it since the part is on backorder.  Our guess was that this particular piece is easily damaged."
0,1,"This wagon is absolutely perfect.  Very easy to assemble.  Very reasonably priced.  My twins absolutely love riding in it.  The ride is smooth, the cupholders are great, and steering the wagon is easy.  It's so handy to take to the park because we can bring all the supplies and leave them in the wagon while the boys are running around.  I can't wait to use this on Halloween - I think it will work perfectly.  Great product!"
1,0,"We got this wagon for Jack when he was 9 months old, we love it on walks through the neighborhood.  He was able to look around and see more, he loves this wagon.  It is very durable, and safe, no places on wagon that can scratch or cut him and no places that can rust as far as we can tell.My only complaint is the wagon is a beast to pull up our steep driveway, consider this if you are going be pulling up a lot of hills on you walks. Brad"
1,0,"This was a purchase for my 3 yr old son. He hates the stroller! This has tons of room and it so easy to maneuver . We had our son and 5 yr old cousin together for a 5 hour festival and 3 mile walk this was great. I will however be making my own cushions for the seats as they made their back ends hurt after a while. Great fit in the back of our Jeep Liberty, Tons of storage and it can be used for so many things. I think all parents who's kids wont stay in a stroller get a wagon!!"
1,0,"I shopped around for awhile looking for the perfect wagon.  I had seen some of the catalogs from major name brands selling these types of wagons for over $150!  I thought paying that kind of money was crazy, especially since I spoil her so much and I have an endless parade of delivery people coming to my door daily...who wants to spend more money on a single item than necessary?I decided to look on Amazon.com since I buy almost everything here.  (Who needs the mall when you have Amazon.com, right?)  I settled on this wagon because of the high backs and seatbelts for my 17-month-old daughter.Assembly was fairly simple and the quality is surprisingly good for the money!  I am very happy with the purchase.  I do wish the tires were a bit different, perhaps more of a solid rubber rather than plastic with a rubber-like material coated over the surface but they serve the purpose well enough to not make that much of a difference.  Best of all, my daughter loves it which is the entire purpose.  The other purpose is that this coming summer I wanted a wagon to take to the beach.  It's no heavier than the stroller I have in the back of my SUV so it will make going to the beach fun this summer.  I can't wait!"
0,1,"We bought the wagon for our Granddaughter's first Christmas. We love it, her parents love it, and she loves it!  It is perfect for one child. It might be crowded with two children. The safety belts work great for restraining a child. Assembly was easy. Steering is easy. I only wish they would offer the all-terrain wheels on this model wagon because it would be easier to pull on grass."
0,1,"Since the day I opened this wagon up and put it together, my children have been loving going on walks a lot more. It works great with the buckles for the youngest children, and the option to fold the seats down to haul items to the park with us when we go. I have gotten plenty of use out of this wagon since I have purchased it and I must say it was well worth every penny spent on it!"
0,1,"Although we have not yet opened the wagon (it's a Christmas gift), we have used this model before. My grandson was ill and put into the hospital. The wagons were used for parents to pull their children along the hallways. Its very sturdy and roomy and a great way to transport your kids. Its an excellent ""little red wagon"" even though theres nothing little about it. I liked this particular model because the seats fold down and because it has seat belts that keeps your toddler from falling out. I cant wait to put ours together and place it next to the Christmas tree for my grandson. What a wonderful gift not only for him but his parents too."
0,1,"I have fond memories of barreling down a hill in my radio flier, wrecking it, and dragging it back up the hill to do it all over again. The wagon I had was the town and country and it has been used and abused. I am now 30 and my parents still use the wagon to haul stuff around it works great. I bought this wagon expecting the same great experience and was dissapointed. It seems very durable and I like the seats with the seatbelts (primarially the reason I bought it). My main complaint is with the front wheels. I understand that you cant steer it while sitting in the wagon but the wheels when I am pulling my son dont track straight & they just begin wobbling thus shaking the wagon. This is a major shortcoming in my opinion and is a significant design flaw (which earned this product the low rating). We will be getting one of the other wagons that have traditional wheels and axles and I would suggest that anyone reading this review do the same."
0,1,"I love this, My son is 4 and loves riding on trips to the grocery store.  We have room for him and lots of stuff"
0,1,I had not checked the parent review on this before buying...was glad it got such great parent review. I was hesitant to buy this only because I had intentions on buying the Step2 wagon.  Glad we bought this one. Our daughter has climbed in and out all day...no tipping over!!!Looking forward when we have warm weather to take her outside so she can ride in it. Also can take this to the mall instead of the stroller that she does not like to be in too long anymore. Like the seat belt idea and the storage area...and cup holders!!!This is a great investment so far!!!
1,0,"My 2 year old daughter likes this. She enjoys setting up the animals and rolling the ball at them. She even loves the bag they came in (a great plastic zipper bag with a handle). She also likes to use the set as an end table when it's all put away.My only complaint is the bell in the ball. It drives me a little crazy, but I guess that's a small thing for my daughter's fun time."
0,1,"This is a pretty fun toy.  I like that my 1 year old and 3 1/2 year old are able to play with it together.  There are lots of things to do with the pins and ball, in addition to bowling.  My only complaint is that the soft ball isn't heavy enough to knock down the pins when my 1 year old rolls it.  She has to use a heavier plastic ball."
0,1,"I bought this toy for my son when he was about 14 months. He never touched and those bowling pins doesnt stand well.. no matter how hard i tried to make them stand .. they fell. Also, packing cover was ripped open with in a month after i bought the toy. there are better product in the market for less price."
0,1,"My kids (3 and 1) love this toy. We've never had problems standing them up on carpet or hard floors. I love that all the animals have their own little jingle/noise, that they are all brightly colored and gentle enough to play with a little roughly (my kids are rowdy)."
0,1,"This is an exceptional sensory stimulating toy. Ideal for infants as young as 4 or 5 months. Having 6 different ways to explore this toy, it will also keeps an infant's interest throughout their quickly developing first year.There is a mirror that spins, 2 wire bead tracks with 2 beads each (different shapes), a spining and clicking circular divice with finger 2 impressions allowing you to teach your child how to turn the disk, an abacus type section with green and orange disks, a spiral &quot;pole&quot; with an orange disk that will fall down the spirals when turned, and finally a cylinder with 4 levels of plastic swiss cheese type bariers allowing very tiny beads to fall through making a &quot;rain stick&quot; type sound. This too spins.It is small enough to take in the car, easy to carry, light yet very sturdy. I have no concerns about any part of this breaking or coming apart. Because it is light weight, it is very easy for the child to manipulate. It will hold their attention, teach them about basic physical properties and laws (such as gravity), and will last through at least 2 children.A good addition to the playroom."
0,1,"I have two sets of twins, B/G who turned 3 in Feburary and B/B who will be one in august. With that said they ALL love to watch daddy work. My older twins really enjoy playing with ""daddies fix it kit"" (what they call his tool chest). I do allow them to play for a little while, (veryy carefully supervised I might add!)but I felt they needed their own tools that I wouldnt have to worry about them hurting eachother with. I did recieve a wooden tool set, which works great and is very cute but I needed atleast one more. We do have a ""Hand-me-down"" tool center but sadly the previous owners lost the tools. I saw this set and LOVED it. The little belt was fabulous, (now they fight over that) and I love the little beeper, although my kids dont seem to understand what its for, they really only know about cell phones LOL. I do have a bob the builder hard hat which is also adorable. But to the reviewers who wanted a tool chest, well I know my children wanted tools by seeing us use the real ones. So if you are inclined to using tools just make one! My husband actually made two. This set is absolutely adorable and I do not need to worry about my children hurting eachother with ""daddies tools"". Sure they dont look to realistic, (Im sure my kids know they arent real) but they are made for toddelers. I know that eventually my kids will grow up and want ""realistic looking tools"" (like the home depot sets which are ADORABLE by the way, just my kids arent quite ""ready"" for that). All in all my two little ""baby builders"" have fixed everything in sight! They hammer tables, they drill in the couches, they twist all their toys (with that wrench I think it is LOL) and they page all of their clients! I am definatly sure that I made the right choice in buying this tool set for my second one. I am even thinking about storing away the wooden set I got as a gift (my children seem to be forever in the ""throwing"" stage and I dont exactly enjoy the little marks I find on the walls) until they are old enough to understand that these toys are for the tool center only. I hope I have this tool set for years to come and plan on passing it down to my younger twins, that is if their brother and sister will let me!"
0,1,This is a cute little starter tool belt. My 2 year old son really likes it. The only thing is I wish it was made with a harder plastic. Boys will be rough and I don't think it will last as long. But I am still impressed on the quality for the price I paid.
1,0,"We purchased this for our 2 year old this Christmas. He looks so cute with this on! The tools are made of hard plastic, not Little Tykes material. They appear that they will hold up for a while. The hit of the set is the beeper. All of our 3 youngest 2-7 love it!"
1,0,"This toy must be one of those 'hit or miss' type things.  My sons were not impressed at all - got on once or twice, and then left the poor blue puppy abadoned in the corner until I sold it on Craigslist.  LOL."
1,0,"What else can I say?  They both really enjoy riding it... on carpet of course.  On tile or hard wood, it slides around too much.  But a great gift for the price!"
0,1,"Our daughter got this for her 1st birthday and she loves it!  She insists on riding it backwards but she still has a great time with it.  At first she sit on him a bounce while yelling go until my husband or I made him go.  But after a couple times she figured how to make him ""go"" on her own.  Now she will sit on this thing and rock like crazy!  I've honestly been surprised she hasn't flipped it over but my husband said it seems to be designed so that won't happen.  It's also very durable!  There is no way she can do anything to it to hurt it.  It's been pushed down a flight of stairs, tossed into our pool (it floated until it hit the deep end) and left in the blazing sun and it still looks as good as it did the day she got it.  This is an inexpensive and durable version of a classic toy."
0,1,My son got this for his 1st birthday but it wasn't until he was closer to turning 2 that he actually figured out how to use it. It's VERY durable!
1,0,This standard organizer is sturdy and great for keeping puzzles from being tossed everywhere. Very handy and makes storage so much easier.
0,1,"I got this for my boys' puzzles.  It's a nice way to store them and keep them accessible at the same time.  It's sturdy and well-made.  My only problem is that it can be tough to slide the puzzles in.  Getting both sides into the corresponding slots can take a minute, since the slots are narrow and close together.  My boys definitely won't be able to do it until they are much older."
1,0,"I bought this for my son because he has many Melissa and Doug puzzles.  It is important to note that this storage case is intended for standard puzzles, meaning that the chunky sized Melissa and Doug puzzles don't work with this-- well they do, but you then need to skip a space before loading the next puzzle, which means it holds less puzzle sets. It does say this in the Amazon product description, but I just missed it.  Had I read more carefully, I probably wouldn't buy again since many of the puzzles we own are the chunky ones.  The storage case is actually in the closet right now and the puzzles are just stacked on top of each other in the playroom.  If you only have standard sized puzzles, then you'll be pleased with the item."
0,1,"I think this was the biggest WASTE of money.  I don't know what kind of &#34;standard&#34; puzzle size they were talking about.  I have numerous unisized wooden Melissa &  Doug puzzles and THEY DO NOT STACK AT ALL LIKE PICTURED. I'm MIFFED.  Maybe the puzzles are standard and they sent me the wrong thing.  Although somewhat pricey for what it is, I thought it would bring order to my playroom and it certainly does not!  Nevertheless, it's not worth further emotions to investigate or return.  JUST STATE THE DIMENSIONS as in &#34;fits puzzles A&#34; by B&#34;.  Standard my arse."
0,1,"I poured over these reviews to see if this wire holder would fit melissa and doug's ""chunky"" puzzles.  Though it is tight, the puzzles DO fit.  But, you can only use them on every other slot, because the pieces stick up just a hair higher than the next rung.  And some of the chunky puzzles fit better than others.  It depends on how far the pieces are placed in the puzzle itself.  It isn't perfect, but it works.  I am still pleased with the purchase.  My daughter doesn't have that many puzzles, and this storage case serves its purpose."
0,1,"Reallt long puzzles or small ones will not fit.  But all my standard size ones do.  The ones with chunky handles will fit, you just can't slide a puzzle in the next slot up."
0,1,"I think this puzzle holder is a great idea and when my son isn't around, it holds the puzzles nicely, however, when he gets to the puzzles, he takes the empty holder and slides around my hardwood floors with it and trys to wear it as a hat.  I would recommend this for maybe ages 3 and up.  My son is 2 and still has to investigate every new piece of furniture or anything we bring home."
0,1,"The puzzles fit perfectly in this storage case. They are easy for a child to slide the puzzles in and out, and keeps them very organized and easy to see. My son has played with his puzzles much more since I started to store them in this."
0,1,Not a fan at all....I have a boatload of Melissa and Doug puzzles and thought this would be great....half of them do not fit properly and it tips over easily. I was hoping to attach it to a wall at some point and maybe it would work better.
0,1,"This ""First Baby Doll"" set is so adorable!  My daughter (23 months old) received this for her first birthday and loves this baby as if it were her own.  It's perfect size for a little one just starting out and learning to love!The baby comes with a soft bottle, stuffed baby bear, clothes, diaper, blanket, four storage pockets and carrying handles for the bed it all comes in.  She loves to pretend to change the babies diaper, feed it, rock it to sleep and place it in its bed.  It's so sweet to see the love she already has for this baby.Seems to be made well as nothing has fallen apart in almost one year.  This is perfect to buy for your own daughter and even better to give as a gift!"
0,1,"My daughter is 2 1/2 and she received this toy for her first Christmas when she was 11 months old. She always plays with this and it is still in great shape. I washed it once and it washes very well.  She has hundreds of dolls yet still plays with this adorable set.  She now likes taking off the clothes and ""dressing her baby"".  She also likes to ""feed"" her baby her bottle and put her to sleep."
0,1,"I won't reiterate what other reviewers have said about specifics of the product but will say it is absolutely well made, worth the price, educational, fun, and as my boys said, ""Totally cool."" My six and eight year old boys absolutely love it."
0,1,"This is a great product, even though my grandson is too young to use it.  I read that it was for kids 8+ and figured, &#34;Heck! My grandson's smart. He can do this.&#34; Well, he IS smart, but he's only 5 years old.  He can put the pieces together, but the toy is so much more than that. He's too young to understand the science of it, and that's more important than just putting it together. (He has plenty of Legos and other blocks to put together!)  I've put it aside and will happily take it out when he's a bit older.  I recommend this for everyone---of the right age."
0,1,My 10 year old daughter and I had fun making the different circuits. This product is educational and fun if you're looking to get them away from cartoons and video games for awhile.
1,0,"The Elenco snap circuits Jr. SC-100 is a fun way to introduce kids to basic electronics, although, much like LEGO, most kids from what I've seen simply follow the instructions instead of going beyond them and utilizing their creativity. In this aspect, it fails as a truly educational product! My own kids and their friends played with them for a while and then moved on to other things. Quality-wise, the product is okay, but some of the parts snap to the base board too loosely while others are difficult to snap on. Of course, the base board is optional. Overall, I think this is a decent educational toy, as long as you keep in mind that your child is unlikely to treat this as anything more than a toy."
1,0,"I bought this for my 7 year old neighbor for his birthday, and his mom said he really likes it."
0,1,"My son got this for his 5th birthday.  He has spent hours working on it with dad at first and now on his own.  He likes to follow the directions, but also has fun creating his own ciruits now that he understands the basic concepts.  So much to do!"
0,1,"I thought this was a great way to introduce some physics to my boys, but they don't seem too interested in it.  I actually ended up using it in my classroom instead."
0,1,"My kids loved this toy. It was different, and nice educational aspect. Attractive to all ages, They createdquite a few different things."
0,1,He is LOVING this set&#8230; so much so that we bought the update pack (to 300) for him for Christmas.  Lots of fun here!
1,0,We bought this for our son when he was 4 because he doesn't play with regular toys. He loves science and electronics. This was perfect! It's durrable and can create many projects. He makes up his own.
0,1,"I was really impressed with this game. Not only fun, but educational. My son was very excited to put together the different electrical configurations with his dad, and you could tell he was very proud of himself for accomplishing them. Definitely a supervised activity, but very fun."
0,1,My 5 year old loved it.. he may not understand all the Electric concept but he gets basic. I actually learned many concept i kind of ignored in school.
0,1,I bought this toy for my grand child for his birth day.  He really is having fun with it.  Great
0,1,"I don't know who had more fun with this, my 6 yr old grandson or his dad!  They loved it!"
0,1,Awesome!  My son loves this game and its educational too!  Does it get any better?  I would definitely buy this for other kids!
0,1,"I have purchased this kit for several children for their birthdays and their feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. This is a great set for introducing young children, from as young as 5 years old to the wonders of electricity, and will provide them with a working understanding of the subject.There are about 101 project suggestions in the kit and even younger children will be able to navigate their way through these projects with the help of a supervising adult or older child. Older children ages 8 and up will manage the projects quite easily- the instructions are clear and easy to comprehend. This is an excellent kit which will engage children's interest and cultivate their interest in science."
0,1,"I bought this toy because it was so bright and colorful with a lot of different items to pull and play with.My daughter LOVED starring at this toy ever since she was a month and a half old. This is definitely her favorite toy. Now at 3 months... she's constantly holding it in her hands and trying to ""eat"" it. haha.I sometimes put it in her basinette when she's going to take a nap... so she'll have something to look at.I LOVE this toy! I highly recommend it... even though it's pricey (almost stopped me from buying it) but it's well worth the money."
0,1,"Freddie was my daughter's absolute favorite 1st toy! When she was a few months old, I took her to babies 'r us, and individually showed her all of the lamaze toys-she had the biggest reaction to Freddie, so I bought him.  It was love at first sight!"
0,1,"I chose this of all the Lamaze toys because of the great reviews, but my 6 month old daughter just thinks it's so-so.  The problem, I think, is that it's so BIG.  It's as long as her entire torso, and the wingspan is shoulder to shoulder!  If she's laying on the floor next to it, she likes to chew on different parts, but it's too large to manipulate well while sitting up (which is all she wants to do at this age).  I suppose maybe when she's a year or so old and a little bigger, she might like it better."
0,1,"My husband bought Freddy for our (then 4 month old) daughter because he showed it to her and she latched on to him and wouldn't let go. She loves the vivid colors and the sounds and sensations that comes from every touch, grab, stroke and crew she gives Freddy. We think this is a great toy and we do not leave home without it, thanks to the handy clip that is on most Learning Curve/Lamaze toys."
0,1,Can we say neverstop!! - she ran this thing into the ground!! played with it alllll the time and still does - highly recommend
0,1,"We bought this toy for my daughter's first birthdy and she absolutely adores it.  She hasn't quite gotten the hang of activating it herself so we do it for her.  However, once the toy starts up she goes crazy dancing right along with Elmo.It seems that many people are angry at the fact that it does not play the entire song but that doesn't seem to bother my daughter and ergo doesn't bother me.  As long as she's happy, so am I. ;)I wouldn't recommend this toy for younger children unless Mommy and Daddy plan to *help* them play with it. It is,afterall, electronic and younger children don't quite understand the art of delicacy.  If left to her own devices, my thirteen month old daughter would slam Elmo on the ground and put him the rubbish bin. We simply keep it out of arms reach and help her to play with it so that it doesn't get broken."
1,0,"I bought this for my kids and I to ""hop race"" with; I had no luck finding an adult-sized hopping ball in the brick & mortar stores.  It has stood up well for the past 2-3 seasons and my oldest has now claimed it as his (even though he isn't quite tall enough for it and it doesn't have a cool Spiderman on it!).  This also provides for a very good workout!"
0,1,But air doesn't stay in it long. My son doesn't play with it much so since some of the air is gone I haven't pumped it back up for him yet.
0,1,"I am a grown lady and I bought this for me :)  My kids all have their own and I thought that it would be fun to have one, too.  I mostly use it as my home office chair, but play around on it with the kids, too.  Very easy to blow up with the faster blaster hand pump. It comes with an extra plug.  So far, our handles have help up, but because I read some of the reviews, I instructed my kids to be careful about pulling up on the center of the handle and we try to hold the sides."
0,1,"This ball is huge, but is great for an adult.  I have fun bouncing around with my 5 year old.  It is fun, great exercize, and she loves racing.  It may sound silly, but I bought a few of these and the whole family plays.  I am sure we look like fools, but we all have a blast!!"
0,1,"Perfect for those days when you can't boot the kids off the couch & away from what ever media (TV. Comp. etc) has been captivating their attention. It gets everyone thinking, moving, and laughing. Actually, this is perfect for anytime and any occation. Lots of fun. A good learning experience for the younger players, & great for working on gross motor skills even for the older players. I brought this with us for a family get together. Even my 9 yr. old niece had fun with this. The younger kids, 2 & 3 yr. olds, needed assistance in where they were suppose to go, but had a great time!I do wish there was a repeat button & that the commands were a bit more spaced apart."
0,1,"Wonderful game for kids to learn their colors, shapes, and objects.  The shape pads are scattered on the floor, the music comes on, and the voice tells the kids what to stand on.  When the music stops, if the person is standing on what the voice says (example: the square, or the red triangle, or the piano), that person wins!"
0,1,"Hullabaloo is simply the most fun game in our vast collection of games.  My daughter received it when she was 4, she is now 7 and it is still in the regular rotation.  Our son's been playing along since he was 2.  The game works even for kids younger than 4, they just might need a little help following the directions at first.  If you have young kids, this is simply a great way to keep them active on a snowy or rainy day!"
0,1,"This is a GREAT game.  I had no idea how much my two-year-old would enjoy this when I bought it.  Not only that, his 8-year-old brother and his older cousins enjoy playing it with him - which is perfect! We often take this game along with us when visiting friends and relatives and it's always been a big hit.  It keeps the kids moving, teaches them colors, shapes and objects and best of all lets them be silly."
0,1,"I bought this for my wife to play with my grandson...this was one of her favorites as a child (and mine, too).  How disappointed we were to see how much the game had shrunk since our youth.  The decreased size made the game much harder (even with our steadier 'adult' hands, and almost impossible for our (then) 8-year old grandchild.  To add insult to injury, the 'little man' on the perch has been replaced by a nondescript pointy-shaped object.  I shouldn't be surprised, a lot of the children's classics that are being reprinted now are horrendously cheap imitations of what they once were.  No wonder so many young people prefer video games!SHAME ON YOU, MATTEL!!!"
0,1,"I have two little boys, 3 and 20 mos., who are huge Wiggles fans.  This was the first Wiggles toy they received, and it was purchased back in June, over 6 months ago.  They still play with it daily! I haven't yet had to replace the batteries, which is amazing considering how often my kids play with it.  The guitar plays some of their favorite songs, including several from their favorite video Hoop-de-doo.  They have the microphone, hot potato, and feathersword along with this, but this one is by far their favorite."
0,1,"Sept 1, 2004 :My son loves this toy and plays with it every day. We haven't even had it a full month and its already broken!  It says toot toot then it starts stuttering and the car stops moving. Also batteries had to be replaced already!Update: 2 more broken ones since then."
0,1,"This is a great toy,when you push on the heads it go's and go's for a long ride.The faces look like the Wiggles and my toddler knew right away it wqas the wiggles,she loves it,and loves the Wiggles guitar,great toys,thank you Amazon for selling them on your site,Wiggles toys are hard to find."
0,1,"We bought this for our son for christmas since he loves trains so much.  I have to say that i wish we would of done alot more research into this before we bought it. Our son is almost 3 and he is absolutely heartbroken over this train.  The depot does not stay attatched very well, the bridge can only be used in one track design, the actual bridge does not seem to fit very well over the two tunnel pieces and causes the train to come off of the track, and in the accessories, you cannot make the train run through the fire station and it gets frustrating trying to watch him put this together himself, which he is unable to do.  This train eats the batteries, we have only had this out for a little over four days and we have already had to replace the batteries TWICE!  The train jumps the track and there is really nothing that a little one can do with this.  This set is better suited to a 5 year old, who likes to run the train around a track and at the same time, push other pieces in pretend play.  I am very disapointed fisher price!"
0,1,"this set is sooo cute.  i was planning to get my daughter the bigger little people home sweet home for christmas but she is 2.5 yrs already and i decided she may not get the play out of it so i just got her this little set.  we are so happy with it, a little playhouse with doors that open and close, a swing that really works and a little baby stroller that has working wheels.  maggie and sonia-lee look so sweet and can sit in their chairs and have tea.  everything can be joined together with the help of the fence piece and you can arrange it in different ways.  the quality of this toy is very high, bright colors, chubby plastic and lots of detail you can't see in the picture here.  this set is the best and cutest ever!  you will not be disappointed."
0,1,"My 2 yr old received this on her first birthday,she loved it then and she loves it now, as with all of her Little People playsets. I thought this was a good starter set. She received the Noah's ark at the same time, and continuously played with both sets. I can tell that she especially loves the chairs and the swing set. She now puts some of the animal characters from her other sets in the cottage, so they peek through the door. I like the safety feature of the doors. They come off rather easy when yanked, so not to get any fingers stuck. The Little People collection by Fisher Price always comes through as a favorite for the growing young mind!"
0,1,"My 3 year old son recieved this for christmas, and he loves it.The airplane swings go around with an easy push and the cars go easily down the ramp.although the ramp does come apart esily if, its bumped, but thats an easy fix.Overall Excellent toy - Perfect Gift!!!!!"
1,0,"We have both this vacuum and the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn vacuum (given as gifts). At first I thought the FP vacuum would be the favorite, it is more colorful and makes more sounds/music/etc. However, all three of my kids prefer this vacuum over the FP one. The only think I can think of is that this one is is taller than the FP one by several inches. My kids love this vacuum and every day someone is pulling/pushing it around the house."
0,1,"I just got this for my son and he loves it.  I bought it for him because he always wants to use the big vacuum.  So, now he is ""cleaning up"" his own messes.  I think the toy is just adorable.  I think this is something we will both enjoy for a long time."
1,0,"I bought this for my little boy for Christmas in '09. A year later he still plays with this (at almost four). My niece who is two really likes this, too. It's a pretty tough toy, the only thing I would say is to make sure you turn it off because it has scared me several times when I walk in my sons room and it starts talking by itself. lol Also, the hose doesn't stay hooked on the front, but it doesn't flop around, either, so that's really not a big deal. My son has had this a year and I've never had to change the batteries."
0,1,This is one of my son's favorite toys! It has a funny voice and makes him giggle. A great toy for a great price!
1,0,"I got this for my 18 month old for Christmas, despite some of the negative reviews,  because he always drives me crazy when I vaccuum.  I wasnt' sure he would like the toy vaccuum, but he loves it and uses it every day.We have only had it for two weeks, so I can't speak for long term durability, but It seems they fixed the problem with the handle, it seems very sturdy.  However, it did start making squeaking (other reviews called it grinding) noises in the wheels when he pulls it, although it doesn't bother him.The volume of the vaccuum is rather soft, although I suppose since every toy is so loud and obnoxious these days, that is probably a good thing.This toy takes quite a beating, being dragged all over the house!  The eyes are losing some paint, but everything else looks good.oh the age range...24 months and up seems ok, although I think this toy is appropriate for any baby that walks Proficiently.  My son was 17 months when he got this and the perfect size for it. However the 4-8 year age range seems ridiculous.  This seems like more of a toddler toy to me.Overall, a fantastic toy, could be more durable, but our son loves it."
0,1,"=o)  I would not have purchased this toy, but we received it free along with our other Leap Frog purchases.  It arrived in the mail today, and I eagerly took it out to inspect it myself, after reading the 50 reviews here...First, it is a hard toy to sneak into - if you are the kind of parent (like me) who likes to trial-play before wrapping.  =o)  Tons of tape, wires, tricky cardboard folds.  Second, I did not think the start-up sound was shockingly loud.  Third, I happily started pushing coins in - and guess what - they got jammed.  I felt like I'd joined the Screwdriver Club as I went to retrieve ours.You don't just ""Drop"" the coins in.  You have to push them past some resistance.  Once they've been pushed in, you see them in a clear tunnel which is vertical.  If it were sloped, the coins would roll down better to the outside ""change pocket.""  I was a little sad that they didn't roll down into the drawer.  The drawer, I guess, is just for storage.  I did not cram the coins in quickly, like my kids will.  All the same, because they didn't always roll across the tunnel, I ended up pushing one down on top of another causing an internal jam.  Then I said, ""ah ha!  The handy little built-in door!""It was not hard to unscrew the small door and poke the screwdriver inside to unjam the coins.  However, I do not wish to do that every time this toy is played with, so I used clear tape to hinge the door back on - a piece on inside & outside of door - and used another piece of tape with crimped edge to hold the door shut.  I would have left the door off entirely, but it looks nicer this way.You know those awful wires they use to wire toys into their boxes?  The black plastic strips that serve as wire anchors, or whatever - I've put one on a ribbon to be the Cashier's Key.  I think my 3-year-old will be able to open the taped door and use her Key to unjam the coins... maybe... it's worth a shot.  At least that will give me time to get the screwdriver, or a nail file, or metal chopstick...Another idea I have is to secure something (tape folded cardboard) to the bottom of the register to make it tilt to its side, so the coins will be sure to roll quickly out of the way of the next one coming.  Again, it's worth a try.Besides these engineering flaws, I think my daughter will enjoy this toy and learn something about money from it.  The coins are not entirely encased in plastic - only around the edges and on backside.  You can feel the texture of the front of the fake coins.  I wish the coins were large replicas of actual coins, in varied sizes, but oh well.  Free toy."
0,1,"The minute I saw this toy on television I just knew I had to have it for my daughter.  She could pull it around, spin blocks in the wheel, put them on the teeter totter, sort them, and even stack them.  Plus, the blocks were toys in themselves.  What more could a child want right?  Wrong.  Actually it was more like, what more could a *parent* want.After recveving this toy for her first birthday, my daughter played with it for all of three days.  She doesn't pull it around but she loves to turn the wheel and here the whimsical noises the teeter totter makes.What we don't like about it is that the yellow door is constantly coming off.  I put it on, she takes it right back off.  Great.  I also think the toy makes a little too much noise.  Instead of just a jingle or a couple of notes as a reward for an action, this toy goes crazy the minute you touch it.  I don't like that. To me it's like it's playing with itself and doesn't really give my toddler the incentive to do much when all we have to do is walk past it for it to go to town with it's loud music.All in all, I would say this is an okay toy.  Not absolutely horrible but nothing to write home to mom about either.  I would have expected more from Fisher Price."
0,1,"I bought this toy from a local consignment shop for a few dollars with four blocks. Please, do not spend all that money for it from here!!! My daughter was 9-months old when I purchased it for her, and now at 11-months she still loves it! It's very durable, after playing with it for a little while and loosing all of the blocks, she drags it around the house by the handle. She also loves that she can stick her hand in the bottom to get it to play music without dropping the blocks. She did, however, learn very quickly to drop the block down the shoot. If you can find it priced right (because it isn't here!!) it's definately worth it!"
0,1,"My 17 month old likes the toy - it entertains him for about 10 min then he is off to something else - it teaches him about cause and effect (when you put the block in, music plays) - the blocks it comes with are brightly colored which babies do enjoy"
1,0,This is a very cute toy.  My son all of the peek a blocks except the farm ones and we love giraffes at our house.  This item is absolutely adorable.  My son didn't like the music it made.  I think because it is very quite and can be hard to hear.
1,0,My 13 month old son received this for his 1st Birthday.He has not played with it since opening it.  The giraffe is absolutely adorable but just sits among his other toys.  He will play with the blocks every once in awhile - but even the blocks do not hold his attention.
0,1,"Oh my. These veggies are the hardest plastic, and the first thing my son did was dump the entire basket onto the hardwood floors. They immediately went back into the basket and got donated to the nursery at church where they have carpet. It sounded like a machine gun with all those little fruits and veggies hitting the floors. No bueno!"
1,0,"They're a great teaching tool.  My granddaughter has learned her fruits and veggies and gets excited when she sees them in the store.  They've also made her want to try, and has come to enjoy, things like brussel sprouts and egg plant!!  They're well made and have held up over the months.  She was 2 when she got them and at 3 they're still going strong."
0,1,"Our 17month old loves this.. not only does he enjoy 'eating' the fruit and vegetables, he loves to fill up the basket with all of his little toys"
1,0,"Other reviewers have explained how this adds to the game play and the fun of playing Carcasonne. I want to add this. I have three children ages 8 thorugh 13. The eight year old finds this game not so difficult to play but 'boring'. THe other two completely enjoy this game. Adding these pieces to the game play only increased their fun. They did not have a difficult time grasping the different types of tiles and the impact it would have on their game play and plotting. Lots of fun.Well worth the money. If I had to, I'd suggest you buy this addition before buying any others.Enjoy."
0,1,"Inns and Cathedrals is really a great expansion.It adds some new tiles to the game, and two new mechanics. Inns and Cathedrals.Basically increasing points on Cities and Roads with a Cathedral or Inn on it.Adds a small new detail which makes the game even better.Add this along with Traders and Builders to get a really large and option filled Carcassonne!!!"
0,1,Inns and Cathedrals is a great addition to the Carcassone product line. I love this expansion and use it every time I play.
0,1,"We have played the game with this expansion pack several times now, and we agree that it adds to the fun of the game.  The new types of pieces are great and help you complete roads and castles.  We were a little skeptical of the new rules at first, but now we like it.  The color is a little different on the backside of the pieces so we have to close our eyes when picking a piece or else we know we're getting an expansion piece, but it is just a slight inconvenience.  We can fit the expansion pack peices into our original box.  We're excited to try some more expansion packs now."
0,1,"In Carcassonne, one always has to keep in mind the many options on your turn, and also be keeping and eye out for future oportunities for building roads, castles and farms. With this expansion, those options increase, and demand a more attentive player at all times.The main thing you have to keep an eye out for is the chance to get an extra turn. With the new special figure, the builder, you can actually place 2 tiles on your turn if you place a tile that contributes to the expansion of a road or castle. This requires the previous placement of said figure and trying not to forget that you can take advantage of that chance. There are also tiles with special markers, that when completed, give you icons representing some trade goods. If you manage to get the most of them, up to 30 extra points can be yours at the end of the game.The last figure, a little pig, can increase the value of farms by a point. Not exactly a game changer, but it might separate a few close games.All in all, I like this expansion, even if it does complicate things a bit, especially for new players or absent minded ones. Recommended for varying up the game or for gamers that like having as many options as possible."
0,1,This is a fun little game that can be picked up and played by just about anyone. Its better in a crowd where everyone is willing to shout their offers over each other.
0,1,"Really, when it comes to board games, I recommend checking out a review on a YouTube channel.  You can even watch some games being played."
1,0,"Game came in great condition and is VERY fun.Must add to your list of games.  Despite the box, the is a very engaging and fun game."
0,1,"If you don't mind a game with a slight learning curve... give it a go.This ones always one of my top choices on game night.Takes a while to set up and get going, but I believe well worth the effort.I love a game with many strategies for victory!"
0,1,"Keep your mind away from the fact that it is based on the economics around the slave trade and you will really enjoy this game! It is one of my favorite games. There are so many strategies that can be at work in a single game and it all depends on what each other player does. The games replay value is not unlimited but has such a a breadth of options of strategies that you could play the game for 6 months and still not be tired of it. The strategy is not the most simple. I wouldn't introduce this to a friend who is just getting into board games, but anyone who has a solid grasp of your basic intro games such as settlers and ticket to ride should be geared up and ready to go for an incredible experience of developing their island and making sure each thing is working and producing at its maximum efficiency while knowing when to produce and when to sell is key."
1,0,"A lot of modern board games are popular for a couple of years and  then disappear.  Puerto Rico has been available for 10 years now and is still attracting new fans and is still played quite frequently in board game groups. It is even available now as an app for the ipad.  The reason for its popularity is the unique use of roles.  Essentially, when you pick a role you get to perform the action associated with that role and get a bonus for a picking that role, then everyone else gets the action described by that role, too.  Hence there is very little downtime because every player is involved in every players turn.  You are picking crops to grow and buildings to add to your part of the island in such a way as to maximize production and generate money to build additional buildings.  Some buildings help with income, some help with points, and some help you produce crops.  Some refer to this as building an economic engine. The race for income and production points can get very tense, and regardless of how long the game takes, you find yourself wishing it could just go one more round.  If you decide to buy the game and find the rules a bit daunting, there are numerous videos on youtube to help you understand the game better.  I do find the rules well written with several examples of how the rules are applied in the margin.  If you type ""board games with scott: Puerto Rico"" in the search window of youtube, that is one of the best videos to help you figure the game out.  Once you get going, this is a game you may end up playing frequently.  Some have played this game several hundred times and still enjoy it.  Ive probably played it about a hundred times now and I still enjoy it as if I bought it yesterday.  The only knock I find to the game is the set up and take down time.  I would highly recommend one of those plastic organizer boxes you keep such things as beads in to keep all the parts separated (I think they are called Plano boxes).  But good organization is needed if you want to cut down on set and put away time.I highly recommend this classic game."
0,1,"Players get a chance to make the island of Puerto Rico a successful venture.  This is done by producing corn, indigo, coffee, tobacco and sugar.  Success comes from production, sales and trade.  Except for corn, the commodities need to be processed after growing.  Players make plantations and build buildings but each of these needs population (colonists) to activate.  Players try to balance production and trade in order to gain the most victory points.  Sales produce money but shipping goods produce victory points.  Different buildings help with production or offer other benefits including exceptions to limitations.On each cycle of the game there is one phase per player.  Each player takes turns being first in the cycle.  The phase is determined by a player taking a job.  They can be Mayor and provide new population to man the buildings and plantations.  They can be a builder, a prospector, captain of a trade ship, or other jobs.  There are more jobs than players so each cycle will be made up of different phases.  Players must figure out which phase will be best for them on their turn and how best to play the phases of other players' choosing.  Once a cycle ends, all jobs are again available.The game consists of player boards for keeping track of their plantations, buildings, money, produce and victory points.  There are tiles representing jobs, buildings, plantations, money, the colony ship, trade ships, money and victory points, and wooden tokens to represent colonists and barrels of produce.  All of these pieces make set-up take a little longer but helps to add a great deal of variety to each playing of the game.  Game ends when a city fills up, there are no more colonists, or no more victory tokens.  Victory points and bonuses are tallied to determine the winner.  Game play runs over an hour and improves as players become familiar with each of the different jobs and types of buildings.  Although there are a lot of different things in the game, it is very easy for a first-time player to follow and do well.  Check it out.There is also a card-game version called San Juan."
0,1,"...there are many details and small pieces to read.I've only played this game once and at first I was a bit intimidated by the set up. Once we start playing, though, it became more clear to me. Although it's not one of those games I could learn how to win the first time around. I can see how the game can become quite complicated (not the game play, but more the strategy) with a table of good players."
0,1,"The rule book to Puerto Rico can be pretty intimidating at first glance.  It's several pages of densely packed text describing what seemed to be an immensely complicated game.  I feared that we would have to refer back to the rule book continually during the course of the game, and that that would make it a tedious experience.Nothing could have been further from the truth.Puerto Rico is not only an exceptionally well-balanced game, but once you've got the basics down, it's quite easy to play without referring back to the rule book at all.  More than that, there's almost no chance involved in the game, which brings strategy to the fore in a much bigger way than in a lot of games.Each player in Puerto Rico works to fill his/her island with plantations and his/her city with buildings.  Each of the plantations, in combination with specific buildings, can produce goods that can later be sold or shipped.  During the course of a typical round, play rotates with each player choosing a ""role"" (for instance, mayor, settler, builder) and performing the action associated with that role.  The catch is that though the player choosing the role gets a bonus for choosing it, every other player then gets to perform the action associated with that role.  This helps to keep any one player from getting too far ahead, as each player gets the chance to do just about everything that every other player does during the course of a round.  The game is won by the player with the most victory points, which are gained through the course of the game.The above is obviously just a thumbnail sketch of this brilliant game, but once you start playing, it's just about all you need to know.  The play moves very fluidly, and it's very organic and self-explanatory.  For instance, each of the buildings has a small bit of text that explains its function.  The functions are explained in much greater detail in the rule book, but for even a new player, the text on the building itself is enough to keep the game moving along.For the balance, and the strategy, and the fact that the game is structured in such a way that no player can run away with the whole thing, I cannot recommend Puerto Rico highly enough."
0,1,Not really much to say about these. They are nice blocks and the kids love them. Ours even came in a wooden storage crate for them. We ordered two more sets for them so now they have a lot of blocks to build crazy things with. BTW... these are heavy hardwood blocks. With all the blocks in the bin - my 3 almost 4 y/o can not lift them alone. He and his brother must carry the box together.
1,0,My kids love this set of blocks and make many castles and towers with them.I actually bought 2 sets.  The second set was by chance when the price dropped a lot at one point and I was able to get it the 2nd time at a steal.  Two sets is a lot more interesting because my kids have enough large pieces to make great structures.The wood is high quality as is the wooden case.
0,1,"I bought this set of blocks two years ago for my kids.  It has been played with several times a week since then.  It's been made into a castle, roadway, marble maze, hideout for GI Joes, doll furniture, pyramids for Egyptian Playmobil, rafts, towers, etc... It is one of the best toys I have ever bought and I have four kids.  They are very durable.  Great for open-ended, imaginiative play!  Also, plenty for multiple kids to play with together.  My 11 year old son just remarked a few days ago that it was one of his favorite toys we've gotten and that there aren't many toys that he and his three sisters (age 9, 5 & 2) can play together and all enjoy.My only qualm with this great toy is that I wish it came in a box that was slighly bigger than all the blocks.  So unless you play ""Tetris"" to align them all in the included wooden box, they don't fit properly.  It's just a little annoying.  But I still rate it a solid five stars.  I would buy it again.  I would buy it as a gift.  I'm sure these will be saved for our grandchildren one day."
0,1,We've been playing with these blocks ever since we opened them Christmas Eve.  They are so well made.  The possibilities of use are endless.  Definitely worth the investment.
0,1,"High quality, 100% wooden blocks with a nice solid feel to them. Nice smooth finish to them, so no worry of splinters even though they aren't painted or varnished. Our kids love them and use them all the time."
0,1,When I got this delivered my UPS guy asked me if I purchase rocks this time. The blocks were a hit with the kids and their parents. Oma is a hero!
0,1,"I got this set for my son 2 years ago, and now, at 5 years old, he still brings these out several times a week.  The variety of shapes and sizes allow for a great deal of creativity, and there are plenty of blocks to build elaborate structures.  Although wooden blocks lack the ""wow"" factor of fancy gadgets, I feel that the longevity of use and the requirement of imagination make these a much more valuable commodity for any toy box than the fad toys in which interest is fleeting.  They are completely solid and smooth, they come in their own storage box, and they are durable enough to far outlast the childhood years.  Furthermore, because they are natural, unpainted wood, they are a blank canvas for those kids--like mine--who want to use markers to add their own artwork.  These are a must have!!"
0,1,This is nicely made and popular with my son. He loves to play it. But the tonal quality is pretty poor. It isn't a musical instrument. We have some friends who have the Plan Toys version with wood and metal. It has a much better sound. I wish we had it instead.
0,1,"A good xylophone is hard to find, and unfortunately this isn't one of them. When making a musical instrument such as a xylophone, the very least one can do is create one with the correct pitch. This atonal mess is good for teaching kids how to play percussion only; might as well buy a drum. I disagree with other reviewers that incorrect pitch is harmless - kids learn at an amazing speed, even as babies, and as they get older they will want to play the songs they love! I would not buy this xylophone when there are so many others to choose from."
0,1,"It was a very nice surprise to get a musical kid's toy that sounds so beautiful. My one year old and I are having a blast with it. I actually look forward to hearing her bang away on this thing, and I can't say that for many other noise toys."
1,0,"I spent way too long reseraching kitchens! There are so many out there.I narrowed my search down to Step 2 brand because their plastic is nice & think & doubled walled so I'm thinking this isn't going to get all warped over time. There are a lot of Step 2 kitchens to choose from! I chose this one because....1. has a microwave with working buttons (How is little girl supposed to cook like Mom without a microwave! Be careful, some kitchens don't have a microwave)2. isn't too terribly big or small - medium sized3. wasn't stupid expensive  (ok, so it was more $ than I wanted to spend on a kitchen - I thought I could find one under $100)4. nice colors5. has counter space to ""prepare"" the food6. has 1 basket & 2 drawers for food storage7. comes with 2 plates, 2 bowls, 2 cups, utensils, 4 pots/pans, salt & pepper - enough to not have to purchase more cooking stuff8. you will need to purchase food separately9. has a working light over the sink that little one thinks is fun10. I really didn't care about the phone on the kitchen, but my girl thinks it great to answer the phone while cooking.11. the burners sounds are cool - there are 2 special pots that when placed on the burner will make 2 distinct different cooking sounds12. Free shipping from AmazonI am VERY pleased with this kitchen. Please don't spend 3 hours researching!"
0,1,"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter for this coming Christmas and I cannot WAIT to give it to her!  I saw it in the store with the other kitchens and there was no comparison.  It's so cute and will actually match my own kitchen.  With the appliances and telephone which make their little ""realistic"" sounds, and an overhead light above the sink that actually works, it's definitely worth the extra, what? $20?.  And the decals that are included are really nice.  They're easy to apply without getting them all wrinkled, plus they are very realistic.It was very simple to put together.  It took maybe 2 hours.  The only problem we had was with some of the pre-drilled holes.  There were none drilled for the backsplash that attaches to the back of the unit, and the holes for installing the phone didn't line up correctly.  But that was really no big deal since we had a power drill.I know my daughter is going to love this.  Actually, I should say my daughter and I are going to love this - since I'm her #1 playmate. I'm on the countdown to the 25th!Edited to add, one year later...daughter STILL loves this kitchen!  She makes me ""cookies"" all the time."
0,1,"I put this together for the wife's daycare and I can attest that it is sturdily built and better in quality than alot of other brands.I liked that the parts that housed batteries were screwed into the playset so they don't disapper and leave the playset without any sounds.  All of the screws went into places that the kids can't access, so no worries of kids getting cut by exposed screws.Some of the stickers were in odd places, but nothing worth dropping a star from the score."
1,0,"I almost did not buy this toy because of some of the reviews that I read on it.  I do have to say that if the crown would stay on one of the castle turrets this toy would have gotten 5 stars across the board.  My daughter loves to play with it and along with the Pony dance stage, they have easily become her favorite Christmas toys.  The crown is made poorly and will not stay on the Turret, which requires you to keep putting it back in place and the second its touched it pops back off again, but other then that the toy seems pretty sturdy."
0,1,"This toy is very cute and plays nice music that wouldn't annoy adults, but it doesn't play nearly long enough even on the long play mode.  Your baby would never get calmed down or fall asleep in this short amount of time.  My recommendation is the Fisher-Price Soothe and Glow Seahorse because it is the same basic thing but has a very long playing time."
0,1,"This is an awesome toy. My baby was 9 wks when we started him on it. He began kicking his legs, smiling and cooing to the world music and educational songs..he loved it! It was exciting to see him so stimulated. The music is fun and catchy...so much so that Hubby and I hear the songs over and over in our heads but that's okay. We enjoy singing them to the baby. The buttons are great fun too. I love the door that opens with a mirror and plays an African chant. My husband and I love to travel and we think this is a cool way to introduce our baby to bi-culturalism early on. The mobile encourages the baby to kick and exercise. All and all, a very cool developmental toy!"
0,1,"We received this as a gift from our son's proud grandma. We started placing our son under this when he was only a few months old. He's just passed 8 months and still finds this to be a pleasurable distraction, for a few minutes anyway. When your child is old enough to sit up, it converts to a sitting style gym. There are two different modes, one for newborn and one for infant. The newborn mode does everything on it's own, plus has a mobile that turns (not to snazzy though). Plus, there is a lanquage/numbers setting or music setting. Both offer a ""world"" type learning system, offering lanquages and music from around the world.Recommened."
1,0,"Small enough for a toddler to carry and put their fingers on the buttons.  Did think the squeeze part was a bit stiff, hope it loosens up with use.  Has been dropped several times and still in one piece so that says something for it."
0,1,"My girls received this as a late christmas present. We pulled it out of the box and gave it a quick look then put it away. My 2 and 3 year-olds played with it all of 30 minutes. Before they were done, i noticed they were enjoying pushing down on the butterflies a little to much. I was concerned the silvery cloth wasn't going to last. we put it back in its box for another play time.This morning, the girls asked to play it again. we pulled it out of the box and one of the buttons had already disappeared into the internals of the accordion. I'm hoping it will be something I can actually fix by unscrewing the according and fishing it out (another reviewer had mentioned doing that). We will see.Pros:its not to hard to make a nice sound. infact, it sounds great.its easy to play something on it (at least for an adult).its cute.the paper that includes some songs also includes a bit of history and information about the names of each part of the instrument. always a fun thing in our family.those instructions teach you how to do a scale as well. this is very helpful in learning how to play!children think its great as well as mom.cons:butterflies are to easy to push throughbuttons fell through hole with minimal play.for a 2 and 3 year old, the bellows are a little hard to get working, I find that I have to help them to produce sound.its a little large for little hands, even the 3 year old (which is in the recommended age). The notes are hard to reach.overall its a cute little gadget. Even with the button missing it makes great sound. the 3 star is because something made for children should never fall apart after so little use. Plus, the bellows are a little hard for the girls to use."
0,1,"We just gave this playhouse to our daughter for her second birthday, and she absolutely loves it.  If she spots it out the window she starts crying to go out and play with it, even when it is bedtime.  I love how I can watch her playing from afar, because of how the sides are open, but she still has two windows she can open and close.  I also love how it has a solid floor.  Other playhouses I've seen, without floors, end up with dead grass and mud in them.  The house is roomy enough inside that I can join her in there, and she loves the phone.  Even though she has a few different play phones to play with, I think she likes this one best because it is most realistic.  The doorbell sounds so realistic, too.  I researched a lot of different playhouses, in different price ranges, and I feel you truly get the most for your money with this house.I'm not giving 5 stars because it wasn't completely easy for my husband to assemble.  He said there were some parts where the instructions said to drill straight, but really he had to drill at an angle to make it secure.  Also, there were some defective assembly parts, like a screw with a flat, instead of a pointed, tip.  The house itself is somewhat flimsy.  When my daughter leans onto the table it does bend down some. But, so far it is holding up, and at this price I really can't complain.Just a warning to other parents... when we tried buying this house in stores in early July it was already deemed ""out of season"", and we were left to either buy it online (and pay nearly $100 for shipping), or travel an hour away to where we did find one in a store.  I learned my lesson to always buy outdoor toys in the spring or early summer."
0,1,"We bought this house for our son's first birthday and he's having a blast exploring every inch of it.  He loves to ""talk"" on the phone, open and close the shutters, and press the button on the faucet.  It's keeping him very busy, and because it has a floor we've decided to keep it inside for now.  That square patch of carpet won't get worn out from him constantly walking around in it.The house was easy to put together.  My husband had it set up in less than 30 minutes.  As for the quality, I'd say it's excellent.  I don't think a house like this was meant for big kids to play in, so it probably wouldn't hold up if your child is too old or heavy for their age.  But it should be just fine for the average sized 1-4 year old, even a smaller 5 year old.  Overall we're very happy with this purchase."
0,1,"Alex loves this! My husband got it for him at 10 months, for his first Christmas, and he's loved it ever since. Last month, we had a barnyard theme first birthday party for him, and we used this as the centerpiece. Cute, but practical, too--his little guests played with it while the adults ate and talked!He loves the chicken (he now says chicken-chicken-chicken, three times in a row, fast) and bawk bawk, as well as baa for the lamb. He laughs when we do the piggy and horsey and cow noises for him. If you ask him to go get a particular animal, or even just make its noise, he runs to get it and kisses it on the nose/beak!He takes the chicken off the roof, and the windmill, too and doesn't like them to be there at all, but I just put those up in the farmer's attic &amp;quot;bedroom&amp;quot; and he seem fine with that. He loves to open the barn door on the back and roll out the tractor, and to put the animals to bed in their little stalls and special places, to hear them make their noises.Every once in awhile, if we stomp, jump or pound on the floor, like when we're running after each other for kisses and tickles, or we bump the barn, say when vacuumming, it will &amp;quot;go off&amp;quot; and play the chicken noise. But not always and it certainly isn't annoying. Just startling, the first time it happens.Have fun with this one. It's a classic and a cutie!"
1,0,I just bought an older version from a friend having a garage sale for $5.00...I would much rather have this one if I had known.  Old or new little ones will enjoy this. It has kept my daughter busy...we have the house too and enjoy it also.I do like the new farm more...with the sounds and interaction it offers.  Both gives littles ones lots of imagination!!!
0,1,We have been buying our girls little people toys for several years now and have several of the play sets.  My middle daughter received this one for Christmas last year and loved it!!  There are sounds in all the rooms!!  She is just starting potty training and she only gets to flush when she has done something.  But with this house she gets a kick out of flushing the toliet by raising and lowering the lid!!  She will sit there for hours playing house with her little people!!  Exellent toy!!!
1,0,"I admit it, I have as much fun with this house as my two year old!  Bummer that it can only be found used.  I suggest to find it on other online venders as it is priced way too high here and usually doesn't come with any accessories (as I found out the hard way).  Additionally, their are two versions of this house.  One has a plastic cat on the bottom middle floor.  That one is not the one pictured here.  It only has some of the sounds.  The other one, the one pictured here, doesn't have a plastic cat built in but each and every room has some kind of sound interaction.  This one is much better, IMO."
0,1,"My 16 month old daughter loves this toy.  Especially all the sounds they make.  (They make so many more sounds than I remember. Although no doorbell anymore :( ).  Her favorite is the telephone and computer sounds. But it also makes a washing machine sound, clock timer, 2 seperate baby sounds, and the toilet swooshing. All get a workout. We do have a hard time keeping up with all the extra parts to it; in one room or the other. But you have to expect that as a parent you will have lots of parts to pick up of any toy. She really enjoys it, and that's what is important.  Keep in mind too that it is still the most popular toy she got at Christmas. I would recommend buying one more set of toys with people included in it. We bought the bus/ice cream truck set. It came with one extra person and extra fencing. (Keep an eye out for all of this series, they tend to go on sale at Target, Babies R Us, etc. I saved easily $20.00 buying it at Target compared to the regular retail of $39.95)"
0,1,"My daughter received this dollhouse for her second birthday last March, and it was a big hit! 7 months later, I can tell you that she plays with it every day, and uses her little plastic dora figures to have parties in the house with the mommy and daddy and baby figures. She loves the sounds from the house, the computer, the toaster and the baby sounds. Our dollhouse has taken a lot of abuse, from being dropped multiple times, pushed off the table and such, and still looks great and works fine. What I like about it, is that unlike the overpriced and incomplete Dora dollhouse, all the parts come with this one, and fit neatly in the house, even when folded up. For the price, this is a durable, entertaining, educational and well made toy."
0,1,"This is a fun and colorful toy from Melissa and Doug.  Little kids enjoy playing with it.  It can be used to teach younger kids shapes, and it can also be used to explain fractions to older kids.  Overall, I like this toy."
1,0,"We ordered this for my youngest daughter's 1st birthday and my niece's 6th.  I also have a 4 and 5 year old at home.  The one year old thought the pieces were fun, but obviously is too young to really play with it.  Really, she'd rather watch the older kids and chew on a ""piece of cake"".  I got a solid 3 days of ""birthday party"" playing out of the older kids, much to my surprise.  We have many other M&D food sets and they all hold up well even with lots of abuse and chewing.  The cutting and decorating are great for fine motor skill development and imagination play."
0,1,"Excellent quality product. All of the Melissa and Doug products we have purchased are top-notch in regards to quality...and the kids LOVE them! The Birthday Cake set is by far the most popular Melissa and Doug toy in our house. It is an excellent birthday gift, too! :)"
0,1,"My daughter is on the cusp of her fourth birthday. She received this set when she turned two. I have been surprised at how much she has enjoyed this and how much use she got out of it. It went largely ignored the first year or so she had it, then one day she got it out and has played with it nearly every day sense. My daughter loves to decorate the cake; serve pieces to me, my husband, and her friends; she even seems perfectly enamored with putting it all back together for storage! I have seen a lot of imaginative play from her with this toy. Of course she puts on little birthday parties with it, but she has also come up with some really innovative uses for the various pieces. I would say that based on my daughter's experience, 3-4 is the perfect age for this set. I have given it as a gift and will continue to give it in the future. It's just that fun and adorable!"
0,1,"My 2 yr old got this as a birthday gift since friends knew she would be getting a kitchen for Christmas. It is:~ very durable~ adorable~ fun to play with~ great giftWhat my gripes are:~ Toooooo many little pieces! Candles, and wooden circle to stick on the cake. I put most of them away for now, maybe later it will be fun and not just messy.~ You can't take a slice out without ruing the cake . . . very frustrating for my toddler.Would I buy it for someone else? Probably."
0,1,"It really does!  The kids (I do childcare) love cutting the cake, putting it back together, decorating it with the durable wood circles (velcro-backed), and--their favorite--adding candles to blow out.  Every day is my birthday with this toy as at least one child serves it to meach each day!  Melissa & Doug...I can't say we haven't loved every toy we've purchased from their line, and we have at least 15. This one is no exception. For the low price we paid for it (during Amazon's M&D sale last year), I'm amazed at what you get (everything but the kitchen sink) and how many hours of dramatic play our boys and childcare kids have gotten out of it, all without even the slightest hint of wear on the durable wood toys. This set makes a wonderful gift, too, especially for a child's birthday. If you want play food for your child's kitchen, don't waste money on the cheap plastic stuff that likely contains PVC and BPA. Instead, invest in this (amazingly) inexpensive set and I promise your kids (and you) will be delighted by it for years to come."
0,1,"What kid doesn't love birthday parties?  Great idea, so cute and fun for any kid.  I would love this if I were a kid."
0,1,"I got this for our granddaughter for her third birthday, and she loved it. Her older brother, who is five, did, too!"
0,1,"Of course kids are all different, this toy may not hold the interest of a child with little interest in pretend play cooking. However, I think the vast majority of children will LOVE it.  I have a 2 yr old & a 4 yr old & both play with it constantly.  Younger ones may not comprehend so much that they are decorating a birthday cake, but the facination of adding and subtracting the decorations (velcro candles, candies, strawberries) is great. I think the construction is good; nothing broken yet.  Only down side to it is collecting up all those circles (candies/strawberries) & candles!  I'd recommend this gift for boy and girl (I've got both)."
1,0,My 4 year old daughter loves this set. It is very durable. She likes to put on the candles and sing happy birthday. It has 3 different types of circle toppings to add to the cake. There is a plate the cake fits on. The pieces are held together by Velcro and are easy to 'cut' apart with the spatula/knife.  This would make a great birthday gift!
0,1,the kids (ages 2-6) all love this!  they love playing happy birthday and sharing their cake creation.  it is well made and the pieces are large enough for the 2 yr. old to put together.
0,1,"Bought this for my daughters birthday. She loves it, she is having a birthday party several times a day. It is a great toy for imaginary play. Boy or girl will enjoy pretending its a birthday."
0,1,We own several of these sets from Melissa & Doug.  They are extremely durable and provide hours of fun.  My girls loves to make a cake!
0,1,We bought this for my 2.5 year old daughter for Christams and it was/is her favorite toy. Its got great features and stand up to a childs playing. Everyone at our house loves to play this with her. The seperate accessories you can buy are adorable too. This is a great buy for a little girl!
0,1,This dollhouse folds up small - and is small.  If you purchase extra furniture sets you have a difficult time getting them arranged inside for both play and storage.  The plastic furniture seems sturdier than the house!If you purchase extra people - it is a tight squeeze.  My kids ended up setting the furniture up on a chair in the kitchen and pretending that the seat of the chair is the upstairs and under the chair is the kitchen and living areas.  MMM - it's going in the Goodwill Box!
0,1,"Folkmanis makes the best puppets! This one allows you to use all 5 of your fingers to operate the three heads and two arms of this fellow. Fierce enough to scare anyone, but soft enough to be loved."
0,1,Perfect size for her American Girl Doll Clothes.  Looks great and fits well with her other doll items.  Would recommend.
0,1,"I got this as a gift for our daughter when she was around 10 months old.  All the other reviews are right - the doors break off WAY TOO EASILY!  But our daughter really liked it, and for that one month, she used it as a walker to help her walk.Now she uses it with her playhouse, and sticks all kinds of things into it.  She is now a year and a half and though it sits along the wall, she still uses it with her other toys. When her friends come over, they always want to play with it for 2-3 minutes, and then they move on. The other noise-makers on the walker keep little 1 year olds interested for a little while as well.I think it was a great gift, but I would not have bought it. 2 stars for durability (due to the doors - they are still somewhere around the house)."
0,1,"I have in the past tried and reviewed Alex Bath CrayonsRub a Dub Draw In The Tuband Edushape bath crayonsEdushape Bath Crayons. Both products, while fun for the kids, have their share of problems. I was counting on a trusted brand like Crayola to put out a quality product, but alas.The Crayola product is the best in class when it comes to usability. The crayon is well constructed and easy to use. It writes cleanly and there is not much crayon dust or crumbling into pieces. But all this comes at a price. The Crayola crayons are by far the hardest to clean up. If you forget to clean it soon after its used, good luck in getting it off. It is a painful process and takes a while getting it off the tub.So based on your patience and willingness to let the kid write with the best bath tub crayon and the subsequent cleaning process, this could be the best or worst experience."
1,0,"My son loves these crayons.  He writes on the tiles and the tub.  They seem to hold up well, even when left in water.  The downside is if you wait to clean them off, they do stain.  They are harder to get out of grout than I anticipated but it just takes some bleach, a stiff brush and elbow grease.  Very pleased!"
0,1,"My daughter has played with this stroller for over a year now, and it's still holding up.  Occasionally the bar at the bottom of the backside will unsnap or the wheels will pop off, but it's not a huge deal as they pop right back in.  All in all, it has been a good toy...."
1,0,"We haven't experienced poor quality with our set (yet) with the stickers peeling, but I was surprised that there weren't any sheets under the puzzle pieces that were full size copies of the completed puzzle. This is way too difficult for the average 3-year old to complete by himself. My boys (8 months and 3.5 years) had fun with me, the 3 yo learning about finding the right borders and assembling the borders first, the 8 month old content to sit by us and chew on the blocks.I grew up with a Winnie the Pooh block puzzle in the 80s that was 12 or 20 paper cubes inside 12 or 20 clear plastic cubes. My son still plays with that set at my grandmother's house. That one comes with a full-sized sheet of each completed puzzle for younger children. You pick which one you want, place the picture in the tray, and then assemble the puzzle on top of that.The least Melissa and Doug could do would be to link to a website or something where you can print these off. As we assemble the puzzles, I'm taking pictures with my phone to print so we can at least have something bigger than the tiny images on the BACK of the tray.Based on other reviews, I might Modge Podge the pieces when the kids are sleeping if the pictures start to peel."
0,1,my 18 month old loves this. We practice saying the animals name and sound the animal makes! He knows them all! Great puzzle very durable considering he likes to use the pieces as balls!
0,1,Melissa & Doug always mean quality...my kids love it
0,1,"We bought this puzzle for our 3 year old, who has recently shown an interest in puzzles.  We chose this puzzle because of the unique shape and the fact that she can create 6 different farm scenes with the peices.  The fact that each side of the block is a part of a different picture makes this puzzle challenging. Although it has only 12 peices, this is a good choice for a child with some jigsaw puzzle experience.  Not only must our daughter assemble the puzzle, without the interlocking jigsaws to help (since it is a cube, each side is straight), she must also flip each peice around and figure out which side belongs to the picture she is trying to create.Because this puzzle is challenging for a preschooler, I am rating it 4 stars.  I would have given it a higher rating, except that the finish is chipping.  It does not hold up as well as the other Melissa and Dough puzzles that we have.  Nonetheless, it is a great addition for a pre-schoolers growing puzzle collection."
0,1,"Maybe she is not as good at puzzles as other kids, but she had a difficult time putting this together."
0,1,Woody is a great toy for the Toy Story lover.. My daughter takes her woody everywhere! He looks just like the Woody from the movie.
0,1,"I bought this game with the hopes of adding something new to our game nights. We're all YBPs (young business professionals) just shy of the 30 year old mark and we like to get together and have some drinks and play board games once in a while. This game held our interest for about 17 minutes, but after that we soon went back to Catch Phrase. Buzz Word is challenging, but the person giving the clues can only read what is written on the card. Catch Phrase allows the person giving the clues to be creative and really come up with something unique or original to get his team to guess the answer. This is my biggest disappointment with this game, the lack of creativity afforded to the reader of the card. I'm sure we'll play this game again next time, hopefully for a little longer than 17 minutes."
0,1,This is a wonderful learning tool for my 2 1/2 year old twins. The letters fit into it like a little puzzel so that the toy can identify each letter correctly. They have been playing with it for just 4 days and can already identify over half the alphabet including the sounds. Their preschool teacher will be astonished when they go back to class in January. This is the best (...)I've spent this year!
0,1,"We got this as a gift when my son was a year old.  He played with it all the time since it was right there on the fridge.  He could put the shaped letters in and out by about 16 months old.  About 2 weeks before he turned 2, he held one of the letters up one day and said ""Ah, Ah""  and it was the letter A!  I was amazed that he knew its sound at less than 2 years old.  I held up another one, Y and he said ""yuh, yuh.""  I went through the entire group on the fridge (about half the letters) and he knew the name and/or sound of each one!  I switched out the group for the other half of the letters, and within 2 weeks he knew them all.  By the time he started preschool at age 3, he knew all his letters and sounds, and I credit it entirely to this toy because I sure didn't teach him all that!  And now, at age 5, about to graduate preschool, he is reading on a 1st grade level.  I can't tell you the leg up knowing his letters and sounds early has given him for his education.  His older sister, who didn't have this toy when she was his age, is still struggling to read in 1st grade.  So I know this toy really helped.  And thankfully, it has a volume so you can turn it down if you get tired of hearing it (though it isn't very annoying, it just gets old after 2 years!).  Anyway, I would recommend this toy more highly than about any other toy out there for helping kids learn their letters and sounds and get a head-start on reading.I'm about to buy a new set for my now 1 year old.  The old one lasted about 2 1/2 years with constant use but eventually the main unit just wouldn't work anymore.  I guess my kids wore it out!  But it got TONS of use and I don't consider it at all a bad investment for that price."
0,1,"My son loves playing with this toy. He can pull it off the fridge and listen to the alphabet song or the sounds of letters.The one major problem I have with the device is the fidelity of the audio.My wife and I played a game where we listen to what it says and try to guess the letter. And sometimes we can't.Our groups of confusion are:F, SN, MB, D, P, T, ZThose groups all sound too similar throughout the whole song. Sometimes I can swear it sing:B says DaP says BuhEvery letter makes a sound and Z says TuhBesides that, it's fun. And our little man has a blast with it."
0,1,"My three year old daughter has had this toy since her first birthday, and she still plays with it every day. It teaches letter recognition, phonics, and of cource the alphabet song! This toy is VERY durable, the batteries never seem to run out (I haven't had to replace ours yet), and the magnetic letters are just big enough that they are easy for her to handle and they won't get lost under the fridge like all of the other little fridge letters. I have to say that this product is well worth the money and more."
0,1,"My 2 1/2 year old daugher loves this fridge magnet.  It's really fun and quite educational.  It's nice the pieces are also grouped into different colors, so my daugther doesn't get frustrated b/c we can always give her some hints when we are playing and asking her to retrieve certain letters by saying ""it's a blue one"", etc.  Overall very happy with it."
0,1,"I purchased this for my toddler thinking that it was a nice update to the classic refrigerator magnet letters that were a fond memory from my childhood.  Unfortunately, I have been disappointed by this set.  It does have a catchy tune that my toddler enjoys and sings, and I think the product basically does what it is intended to do, but I have complaints about the design.  First, when I opened it, the unit either incorrectly identified or did not identify at all several of the letters when placed in it.  Second, it is too heavy for its magnet and constantly slides off of the refrigerator, making it difficult for my daughter to play with it there.  Third, there is no case to hold all of those letters so several were quickly lost.  It is true that the letters can stay on the fridge, but since the central unit will not stay put, it makes no since to keep it or the letters there.  I think an included case would have been a nice (and reasonable) addition to make this a more portable toy.  I say, spend less money and stick with the old-fashioned letters!"
0,1,"my twins drove me crazy continually pushing these buttons, but at the age of 20mos, they both started singign the alphabet song.  love it!"
0,1,We bought this item for a Christmas gift when my daughter was 8 months old.  She loves it.  She still plays with it now that she is 17 months old and can sing 1/2 of the ABC song.  Also helps to keep her occupied in the kitchen when I am trying to get stuff done.  Love it!  ** added**  Now that my daughter is 2 she knows the whole song and still really enjoys this toy.
0,1,"The Fridge Phonics Magnetic Letter Set really does transform your refrigerator into a learning center! With 26 magnetic letters and a magic reader that recognizes which letter is placed inside, this interactive product inspires your child to develop language, exploration, creativity and motor skills. My oldest son when he first started learn how to read, went over to the refridgerator (on his own!) to hear the sounds of letters when he couldn't figure it out on his own. You can place one of the letters into the magnetic letter reader to hear a fun song that teaches the letter's name and sound.  For example if you were to insert the A letter and push on it, it sings (it doesn't acutally say what I wrote in the apprenthesis): A say ""A"" (the long sound) and A say Ahh (short vowel sound), every letter makes a sound, A says A and Ah. Plus, you can press the music note button to hear the Alphabet Song!  All my three children play with this almost everyday.  It's also great entertainment for your child while Mom or Dad is cooking."
0,1,"I bought this for my son for Christmas, he immediately loved pressing the magnets and listening to the songs. Now, at 19 months old he can find 10 letters when prompted. He loves it!"
0,1,My daughter is three years old now and got this when she was two. She still loves to play with this as does her 11 mths old brother. She loves to sing along to the songs. I love that is teaches them the abc song. Great toy for toddlers!
1,0,"i never thought toys could teach children so much. the leapfrog alphabet series is amazing. we have the fridge phonics, as well as the letter dvd's and tons of other leapfrog items. they all reinforce each other, because they all sing the same alphabet songs. my son knew his abc's at age 21 months, the sound each makes, too! he was slow to talk, and i believe these toys really helped him along. buy it! buy it!"
0,1,We bought this toy for our 22 month old son for Christmas. He copies the sounds the letters make and is starting to sing the ABC song. So far there are no problems with it saying the wrong letters. This toy is very educational and is our son's new favorite thing to play with. So glad I bought this toy!!
1,0,"I purchased this for my 4 year old that has been resistant to learning letters.  He was playing with it this morning and enjoying searching for letters.  I only wish that they had added some additional language to each letter.  For example, instead of just saying ""a"" and the ""ahh"" sound, it would have been helpful to say ""apple"", etc.Other than that I think it is good, probably even better for slightly younger children."
1,0,This toy has been a hit with my daughter (18 months) since I opened it up for her! She loves putting the letters in the unit and hearing the little song which gives the name and sounds of each letter.  She also loves hearing the whole ABC song and knows it is chunks!We use this on the floor because she scatters the letters around and in the kitchen it can be a slipping hazard.She can correctly identify a few letters now and I attribute that to this toy!Thanks LeapFrog!
0,1,"The kids get bored with it because it's the same tune for each letter.  I think the word-making option would be better, but I don't have that one so can't really say.  We do have the farm animal fridge game and the kids always liked that one--more variety."
0,1,I bought this toy for my daughter fr her 3rd birthday.  She is 4 now and even though she knows all of her letter sounds she loves to use the magnets to spell words.  It is great with the word wammer because you then have more magnets and can spell even more words.  I like this toy because while I am cooking dinner my daighter has something to keep her entertained while still being in the kitchen.
1,0,"My youngest, who is two, received this for Christmas.  She likes it but has a hard time turning the pages.  Now my other two girls are 4 and 5.  They love it and have a easier time with it.  They have been helping the youngest work it.  But over all We like it."
0,1,"Our son, now one year old, has liked the leap pad since we got it several months ago.  He pushes the buttons to hear the music and sound effects.  However he also is fascinated by the slot where the sound card is inserted.  He keeps pulling out the sound card which makes it hard to read the books to him.  If Leap Frog designed this to secure the sound card then our son might not be distracted by pulling it out so much."
1,0,"Please ignore the ridiculous 1 and 2 star reviews here folks.  They are unwarranted.  We have an 8 month old girl, who is delighted with this product, but if and only IF we show common-sense enthusiasm and guide her through the 'touch-screen' process in this product.  This of course, is true with MANY learning products and books.  An infant 'feeds off of' your enthusiam, love, and willingness to teach them.  The 'LeapPad' is essentially an electronic, touch-sensor driven learning tool, that in my opinion, is better suited for babies over a year old, since at that point, their motor skills are better developed than a younger infant, and can actually 'activate' some of the touch-driven sounds this product can perform.  This is not to say a younger infant (our 8 month old being an example) does not enjoy or benefit from it.  For the price, the 'LeapPad' is a decent value and tool to expand your infant's/child's knowledge and imagination base!  Buy with confidence!"
0,1,"We bought this for our son at 6-months and then it it was nice because it was great for story time to hear music and soundscapes. However, it was no more fun (or animated) than when we read our paper books with lots of sound effects. Now he's 16-months and only turns it on and off because the touch pad is too difficult to activate for little fingers. His favorite book to hear is ""Mr. Brown can Moo can You"". This is a great book with lots of sounds but my son can't get it to work on his own. So this toy is only good when I am playing with him. In that case, I prefer to cuddle up with a good old fashioned hard bound Mr Brown and make my own ""Moo"".  I should have waited for the other leap pads. I hear they're great."
0,1,"We bought this toy for my daughter Christmas '03, she was 21 months old at the time. Like many other reviewers stated, her favorite things to do were turning it off and on and pulling out the cartridges. I started to lose patience when playing with this toy because she wouldn't play ""right"", so I put it away until after her second birthday.Now, she does a little bit better with it. She doesn't turn it off and on anymore, and she understands that the cartridge has to stay in otherwise it won't work. She also understands the concept of pressing the ""green GO button"", but has to be reminded sometimes. It is easier now for her to press the pictures, but is still frustrated sometimes now that she is in the ""all by myself"" stage and doesn't want me to help her.The stories are fun and I am amazed at all of the activities that are built into one story/cartridge. I think it is a good car toy now that she can do many activities alone. The pillow back makes it easy to use in the car.In response to one reviewer, these type of learning toys are not meant to take the place of a parent or other person reading a ""real"" book, but to enhance the experience. My mom is a teacher, and just recently read a study stating that reading comprehension levels (of 2nd graders I believe) have increased 37% since the introduction of these type of electronic reading toys. My daughter LOVES to read stories. Tonight we read 3 before bedtime. But now that she does better with this toy, she likes to ""read"" with it, too. I am looking forward to graduating to My First Leap Pad.Although this is not my favorite Leap Frog product, I do like it and even bought one for my niece's second birthday."
0,1,"My son (now 11 months) still doesn't show any interest in this toy (we got it when he was about 6 moths old), but he doesn't show much interest in books at all yet.  He just likes to turn pages and the pages on this toy aren't easy to turn.  Maybe he'll like it more as he gets older."
0,1,"Although I find it fun and highly educational, my 20 month old daughter doesn't seem to care for it too much.  It may be that it doesn't respond to her touch fast enough or that it is not sensitive enough.  She gets frustrated and moves on to her more traditional toys."
0,1,"This is a great toy!  I usually do not like electronic toys, because I want to be the one teaching my babies, not electronic toy.  But, this one is different.  It's great.  This is a toy that you and your baby use together.  I bought this for my daughter who was 20 months old.  She loves it.  The best cartridge for her age is the one called Baby Words (or simular to that title) and has a picture of a baby on.  It has the funniest game that is a song that goes to a popular tune and goes &quot;find the shirt, find the shirt (then baby presses the shirt) thank-You for finding the shirt&quot;.  It's so funny!  My older children LOVE playing this game with their baby sister.  The books are sturdy.  The toy is great.  It's not really a toy that baby can play much on his/her own.  It provides fun for both baby and Mom/Dad together.  And lots of fun for an older sibling to play with baby with.  There are 3 different levels that grow with your child.  Highly reccomend!!"
0,1,"I don't know what other people are saying because we love this toy.  The only negative thing I could say about it, is that it goes through batteries quickly - but we got rechargeable ones so that isn't too big of a problem.My son got this for Christmas last year when he was 1 1/2 and has had no problems playing with it on his own from the very beginning.  It's a life saver on long trips in the car.  We can just give it to him and he is entertained for hours.  It has 3 different levels of interactive play and the very basic level was fun for him from the very beginning.  He imitated the sounds and now he is repeating the words that the LeapFrog says back to him.The additional books come with cartridges that you have to put in a slot at the top and when we first got an additional book it was hard for him to not want to pull the cartridge out, but once we showed him that he needed it to play his new book he no longer tried to take it out.  Now he can (and has for a while) change the books and the cartridged without any help.Perhaps there are inferior ones on the market and maybe we lucked out- but love this product and would definitely recommend it to all my friends and to all Amazon customers."
1,0,some things do not get better with age....some things do not improve when re imagined.  this is one of those.  It is fun and will provide hours of entertainment but it lacks the quality of the old version.
0,1,"I can't say enough great things about this jumper.  It is a little large for the standard sized living room, but not overwhelming.  The walls of this unit will cave in if your child runs into them, but they don't cave out when they lean on them from the inside.  My two toddlers bounce themselves silly in this thing, they love it, which means I absolutely love it as well.  This jumper should come standard with any child who loves to jump around."
0,1,"Balderdash is probably the best game in its genre: light, party game. Balderdash was created by veteran game designers Laura Robinson (""Identity Crisis"") and Paul Toyne (""Beyond Balderdash"") and is published by the ubiquitious Parker Brothers Games.In Balderdash, players are read a word, a person's name or a movie title. Players then secretly write down a false answer depending on what was read. If a word is the topic, players make up false definitions; if a person's name is selected, players make up a false ""claim-to-fame""; if a movie title is chosen, players make up a false synopsis. The false answers are collected by the player whose turn it currently is. That player reads the false answers along with the correct answer. Players, in turn order, attempt to guess which answer is correct. If you guess correctly, you score points. If you guess someone else's false answer, they score points.Balderdash is a great game of creativity and bluffing. It can really get the creative juices flowing. For what it is (a light party game), I give it 5*****. If you are looking for a serious strategy game, you will have to look elsewhere."
0,1,"We bought this for my son's 4th birthday and both of my boys (ages 4 and 7) enjoyed playing this game.  They like the gross out factor of the items in the head. It's a great game for young kids as it doesn't take long to play.  With my boys, I have a problem with sore losers so this game is perfect as you don't have to have a winner or a loser.  You can all just take turns finding the objects and if you do, you're all winners."
0,1,"My girls love gross things and really wanted this.  I was very happy with my husband's mother picked this up for them, and we immediately set it up.  There are only a few things to put into the head (ours didn't have moldy cheese) such as Ned's Earwax, Dirty Diaper, and a rat.  We had a Wiggly Maggot and Itsy Bitsy Spider to add with the blank cards.  The blank cards do allow for you to find gross things to put in, which should be easy after a visit to the toy section.You do need several player for this, because two makes it too easy to find the item in the tent.  It does get boring after 5-10 minutes, since there are only a few things in there.  It might be more fun once we add more pieces.  Overall, this is a fun game for kids.  I don't see the girls getting a lot of use out of this unless we have several more pieces to rotate between."
1,0,"I have a niece and nephew who are both 4 yrs old, and I work in a preschool classroom, and every kid that plays this game LOVES it. There are some very interesting things in Ned's head, but you can take out and add whatever objects you like; they even add blank cards so you can write new objects in. But you don't have to play with the cards (we usually don't). We just take turns putting our hand in and guessing what we've got. It's like a variation on a ""feely box"" or those boxes our kindergarted teachers cut a hold in and had us feel the object to guess what it was.Comes with a giant head, lots of pieces, and playing cards."
0,1,"We got this as a gift when our daughter turned one.  She loved it and liked to murmur in the microphone.  The microphone stopped working when her saliva got inside it.  It worked after it dried out.  The music is really fast and loud and it's hard to follow along what the toy can do.  Anyways, one day when she was playing with it, she flipped the whole toy over and the puppy's arm broke off.  We didn't see it happen, but then a few minutes later, my husband saw her chewing on something white.  It was the arm!  Luckily we were able to get it out before she choked on it.  After emailing Vtech about the problem, they told us that they never had any complaints about this toy, which is very popular.  They also sent a prepaid label so we could send it back, and also would send us a replacement toy of our choice.  We decided to get the Smartville Alphabet Train Station, which was sent to us very quickly (here in Hawaii too).  Our daughter now plays with the new toy, but I think she misses the microphone part from the old toy.We were pleased with Vtech's quick response and action, but wished the toy was more durable since our daughter liked it a lot."
1,0,"My 2 year-old daughter received this toy for her 2nd birthday.  She was so excited about it and played with it for all of an hour.  That was a month and a half ago and Lily hasn't been played with since.  She really doesn't do much.  She only sings two songs!  Really, really boring toy."

At least I can't find stuff animals of other brand can be better than this. It's durable. Although it's said it's not machine washable, I wash it in the machine for several times. It looks not as new one any more, but still very soft and beautiful."
0,1,"To start my review, I would like to mention that I bought these from Amazon, and paid less than if you were to buy the from Insect Lore direct.  I am not sure I would pay that high of an amount for this product.However, with the price on Amazon, we were thrilled with this product.  We purchased this in December for Christmas, but waited until the end of May when it was warm, but still cool, to get the ladybugs.  They are shipped via USPS.  I ordered them on Wednesday, but the company waited until Monday to ship them to make sure that they didn't spend a weekend in the post office.  When they arrived, we had 15 live larvae.  They grew and produced into lady bugs.  We ended up with 8 lady bugs.  They were very active and fun to watch.We also purchased the butterfly, and although I would recommend that one as well, this one was more fun to watch.  A lot was going on, and my kids really liked how tiny they were.  They would pull out their magnifying glasses and look at them all the time.I am thoroughly pleased with this purchase, but just like any and all products, make sure it is the appropriate price for the purchase."
0,1,"Bought this in conjunction with the butterfly garden.  the children loved watching the little ladybugs hatch and grow.  Good learning tool, especially for those of us who home school our children."
0,1,"The LadyBug Land arrived in perfect condition, no problems with that item itself.  But, then we ordered the larvae from Insect Lore (with the coupon code included in this item).The package arrived earlier than tracking information indicated and was placed in my mailbox where it sat in the August heat in St. Louis for several hours since I wasn't expecting it til the next day.  I was surprised they were shipping it in such hot weather to begin with (temps were 90's-100) so I was very worried and keeping track of where it was so I could make sure I'd get to them quickly.They were in a white, unmarked bubble mailer - no indication of anything living inside of it.  When I opened it, it was obvious they were ALL dead.  There were about 20 larvae in there.  I had hoped maybe once I got them into their LadyBug Land and put a couple drops of water on the sponge that they would perk up or something, but they didn't.  All obviously dead.I sent Insect Lore emails and pictures of the dead larvae - no response.  It's been 2 weeks and I don't expect to hear back from them...  I'm planning on filing a complaint with amazon and seeing if they'll have better luck getting in touch with Insect Lore than I have.We ordered butterfly larvae from Insect Lore last year and had a great experience!  We expected it to be the same with the ladybugs, but we are VERY disappointed.My 5yr old daughter is so very disappointed, as am I.  She cried because they were all dead and she didn't even get a chance to see them do anything.I would NOT recommend this product.*** UPDATE ***I still have had no response from Insect Lore as of 03/11/14..."
1,0,"This bug watch is unique. It was purchased as a birthday gift for my 7 year old son, who is extremely interested in bugs, lizards, frogs and other small animals. He already has several other types of ""bug homes"". We live in South Florida, so it's always ""bug season"" around here! This little gadget is pretty cool because it's portable and allows my son to do other activities, while keeping the creepy crawlers close at hand. The thing I like most about it, is that once it's time to come inside, or go to bed... we MUST release the captured creatures. With some of the other bug crates that he uses, it suddenly becomes an issue once it's time to release the bugs. With this little Bug Watch, there is NO room to create a habitat. As a result, all bugs MUST be set free to buzz another day. No more long term buggy commitment. He can look at the bugs close up, carry them around with him, and then at the end of the day, it's easy (and emotionally painless) to set them free. The wrist strap is durable, the top pops right open when you press the release button, and it's the perfect size for small insects. An overall good buy, especially for the price!"
0,1,"I really like these dot painters because you can also write or paint with them as well as use them for dots.  The paint flows out evenly and generously, but not so much that the paint drips down the paper.  Definitely good for kids that are not ready for paint and a brush, and less messy."
0,1,My son isnt a big fan of art projects but this one he loves.  It is simple and fun.
0,1,"My two year old grandson could not do this puzzle without help.  You have to get the blocks in straight to make the sound.  However, a more patient child could certainly learn to do it, and my grandson loved the noises and sirens."
0,1,"I usually love Melissa and Doug, but these blocks are below their usual standards.  The pictures are warping.  Was disappointed with the quality of the sounds.  Both the blocks and the base are heavy so if your child is into throwing things I wouldn't buy this for safety reasons."
0,1,"This bag of accessories are super cute and tons of fun! Will work perfectly for almost any baby doll, I just wish the bag it came inwas a little larger! Once you take everything out the first time, good luck getting it back in again!"
0,1,My 3 year old and I do a puzzle every night before bedtime to relax and wind down the evening. His favorite are floor puzzles. I really like this puzzle because it is a floor puzzle so it is big enough for both of us to do together and it also poses a little bit of a challenge and isn't too easy for him to do. There are lots of dinosaurs on the puzzle and it makes for a good conversation piece between us. It is also a good quality puzzle and heavy duty.
0,1,Our grand kids love these puzzles.  Great quality!  I don't want to write any more about this review.  Why do I have to write a certain amount of words.  Quit this or I won't review any more purchases!!!!
0,1,"we still absolutely LOVE this glow-in-the-dark planets and stars kit, along with theGlow Moon and Starsthat we also purchased from Amazon.  We put the moon and stars on the ceiling, and the planets along the wall.For a child who was very afraid of the dark, this made bedtime go MUCH smoother, and way more fun.A couple tips:1)  When you start getting the kids ready for bed, put their bedroom light on so you can get the planets, moon, and stars ""charged up"" with the light.  5-10 minutes is all they need.2)  After lights, we sit on the bed together and enjoy the beautiful night sky.We keep a flashlight (the kind that plugs into the wall to charge)Dorcy 41-1045 5MM LED Rechargeable Flashlight with Built-In AC Adaptorin the kids bedroom, and when the stars start to fade out, we use the flashlight to brighten a few of them up.  (you can do this while still sitting on the bed). It's a fun way to wrap up the night.  This helped them learn the planets because we'd brighten one up with the flashlight so it would glow, and then talk about which planet it was, what made it different from the other planets, etc.We've also given these as gifts to other kids, and they've been a real hit."
0,1,"Got these for my boy for Christmas just thinking it would be neat. Now he is obsessed with the planets and says goodnight to them every night. Just enough sticky stuff to go around. The stars don't stay bright for very long but it is pretty good for bedtime. By the time they go out, so does he."
1,0,"It came to my attention that a little boy,(a friend of a friend's son) who's Dad was temporarily away and unable to help, was showing an interest in astronomy, and was also in need of some decorations for his room. These were just the ticket to make a little boy&#8217;s Christmas a little better and give him a cool room!This glow in the dark starts and planet set is just the thing for a childs room or for a classroom science board!"
0,1,"My boys actually never played with these, even to use as building blocks. They are well crafted, and neatly designed, but they are very heavy with sharp pointy ends on the square pieces. Perhaps they would be good in a classroom ""store""  role play setting, or I have seen museums that have grocery stores and kitchems set up for kids to role play in."
1,0,We Bought these for all the kids bedrooms. Really makes the ceiling look nice at night all lot up with stars! Very cute!!
0,1,"Its a great price with a lot of stars and putty! I don't leave the lights on during the day, just the good old free light from the sun coming in and the kids get a good 15-20 minutes of star lights when going to bed. I don't expect them to last all night but they are bright, so I am impressed!"
0,1,"The figures are poorly made, glue is caked on, I would not recommend these. 4/4 Melissa & Doug items we ordered for xmas were cracked or had paint peeling. We're staying away from this company from now on."
0,1,Purchased this playset for our young grandson for Christmas.  He immediately went into 'fantasy' mode.  Very sturdy and can handle rougher play.
0,1,This is paired with the Melissa and Doug castle that my 4 year old has been playing with non stop since christmas morning.  Well made and lots of fun.  Would order again.
0,1,good old traditional fun!
0,1,"Here is what my 6-year-old daughter says about this set:""All the horses are flocked. The colors are beautiful. You can play lots of games with them. I like to play horse rescue games. All the compartments have pictures in the background.""I'll add that this set has absolutely enchanted her, to the point where she doesn't play with her larger-sized horses any more. That may change, but this toy is a winner."
0,1,"These horses are truly adorable and really fun to play with--both my girls love them!They are fairly well made and the manes and tails look great and don't fall out with use. I have also been surprised how well the flocking has stood up over time. My older girl, who is rougher on toys, has succeeded in rubbing off some of the flocking on a couple, and slightly cracked a leg when jamming another into a small space, but I think with normal use, these toys probably should hold up fine. Also, there are quite a few, so ruffling one or two won't be the end of the world.They come attractively packaged in a wood box that, while bulky, is nice, and a good way to store them if you have room.The back has fun facts about each of the breeds, which has been a good source of ""horsey"" information for the girls."
0,1,I bought this as a birthday present for a little girl who has her own real horse. She plays with them every day.
1,0,"These are almost like &#34;little green army men&#34; for today's little girl. My three year old enjoys these horses very much. Each is different from the next, and each seems to have its own personality. They are slightly fuzzy, with tails that can even be brushed. They were a nice addition to go with the Melissa and Doug Horse Carrier. The display box appears to be made of really dense press-board which gives it an almost wood like feel and rigidity. If you have any questions about the product, feel free to ask and I will be happy to try and answer them. Thanks.SPO"
0,1,"We have plenty of the plain wooden Thomas risers, which can be easily knocked over. These Elevated Track Foundations are much better.  The track grooves on the foundations are deeper, so the tracks don't slide off the sides.  The foundation pieces also have holes and dowels to assemble them more securely.The set includes four plastic bases, two wooden ""brick"" pillars, and four top pieces.  You can make four single-level foundations, or two single-level and two double-level foundations.These foundations prevent a lot of frustrated moments and track repairs.  I highly recommend them!"
1,0,"The toy is well constructed and easy for kids to assemble. It has opened up a whole new world of layouts with our existing track...not to mention the fun of switching rails. Watch out, though. You might see a few train wrecks."
0,1,I purchased this for my grand daughter for Christmas.  We have had so much fun with it.  She is 4 years old and the regular sized tea set were too big for her.
0,1,"I have played with Yo-Y0's ever since I was about 10,over 60 years ago.In those days,Duncan was the big name for good Yo-Yo's.They were made of wood and had a fixed wood axel.When I first saw the Fireball,somewhere over 15 years ago,I was completely blown away.Over the years the Yo-Yo craze has become widespread and fades away;only to become a craze a number of years later.With each craze,new design and improvements appear.However with the last craze ,the advancements in Yo-Yo's has been astounding.Yomega has led in the design and manufacture of Yo-Yo's.Plastics and metal have outstripped wood Yo-Yo's and the fixed wood axle has been replaced by metal and incorporating various types of bearings,nylon ,plastic and even ball bearings.Electronics have also been introduced that count tricks,lights have given excitement,particularly in the dark.And some Yo-Yo's are also even musical.There are a lot of real good Yo-Yo's to choose from;but there are a lot of real cheap junky stuff around,particularly in places like ""Dollar Stores""I have a large collection of Yo-Yo's and without exception,Yomega Yo-Yo's are all excellent and are some of my favorites.The Yo-Yo's today allow one to perform tricks that are much more difficult or impossible than with Yo-Yo's of the past.String tricks with Yo-Yo's are made easier when the Yo-Yo has a long spin or ""sleep"" time.This Yo-Yo goes by the name ""Auto Return"" because it has a built in clutch .So,it is very easy for any beginner.This clutch makes the Yo-Yo come back up or return automatically once it slows down enough for the clutch to engage.This feature has one drawback.Many ""tricks"" require one to make a Yo-Yo ""sleep"" for some extended time,but you can't control the sleep time with auto return Yo-Yo's ;so this is a poor choice for fancy,extended or string tricks.Some other Reviewers have commented that the quality is somewhat lacking.I have had mine for a long time and find it of excellent quality as are my others manufactured by Yomega."
0,1,I passed these and the yomega fireball out to as many friends I could afford to and they all loved it.
0,1,"It is a perfect microphone to play with.  Doesn't need batteries and always works! It is quite a bit larger than I was expecting, but it is a great play mic."
0,1,Wish it amplified the voice a little more but it is still a cool inexpensive toy. I keep one in the car and pack it in my son's suitcase when he is spending the night with relatives.
1,0,Super super cheap! My 20 month old broke the top off it literally 5 seconds after I gave it to her! Thankfully I can pop it back on but it is a pain.  I do have to say she enjoys it though.  I thought there would be more of an echo.
0,1,"Cheap microphone with the spring that vibrates, but my daughter is happy with it."
1,0,"My son loves this. It is still working after a year. For such a low price, it couldn't be beat. Great addition to musical collection! My son started using it on his 3rd birthday and still uses. I don't think this item is easily broken because my son is pretty hard on his toys."
0,1,"This tent is cute, colorful and fun for my toddler.  She has a hard time with being scared in the night, so we purchased this tent to make her feel more secure.  It was super-easy to assemble, and she has tried to climb the outsides and it stayed not only intact, but in place.  We are very, very pleased with this bed tent.I did take another reviewers suggestion and place a twin featherbed in it, with a sheet over, because she would be sleeping on plastic if we didn't.  We suspended twinkling lights from the ceiling over the bed, and they shine just enough through the canopy to look like twinkling stars over the tent top.  If it was big enough, I would climb in and go to sleep and sleep hours and hours.  We are all jealous of how snuggly her new bed is!"
0,1,"I ordered this for my 18 month and 3 year old daughters. I get that the title says mini but I was really surprised how small it was. The top didn't sit on the box properly and the peg maze didn't move fluidly at all. It was like it was made by child labor in a third world country and passed off as a nice educational toy. I returned it the day it arrived. Really, this thing is almost a joke. I truly can't understand how anyone could give this a good review. It's just terrible."
0,1,"But they don't love for long, like anything else. Sturdy and reusable for other kids though, which is nice. Makes a great gift."
1,0,Purchased the mini play cube for my granddaughter for Christmas. Think she will love it. Lots of fun activities on the cube.
0,1,Our little grandson will be trying to fix and build everything with tool set and I will have to worry about him getting hurt or breaking something with this.
1,0,"My daughter was starting to not like baths anymore. Between these color-drops and bubble bath,she now loves baths and we can't seem to get her out of the bathtub. They work really well. One drop makes the water colored without fear of staining the shower curtain. It might be nice to have a bigger variety in colors, but the basics included in this set have kept her happy."
0,1,"Almost 8 dollars for (essentially) food coloring that doesn't stain seems a tad pricey to me, especially when I do two seperate baths a night with 2-3 color tabs for each bath. I use 2-3 because my kids like the brighter coloring, instead of the pale coloring that 1 tab provides. I can usually find a different brand of these at our local Wal-Mart for much cheaper, but I got these because the others were out of stock. Bottom line, I like them because they don't stain and my children like them because they make the water pretty!"
1,0,"Whenever our kids are going in for bath time, they always get very excited about picking the color for their water.What's so great about them:- The drops do a good job of coloring the water- Dissolves quickly enough that there isn't a delay to getting done with bath- No issues with staining when colored water is left in the tubWhat's not so great:- Some of the color combinations when you use multiple drops are less exciting (all three colors gives you grey)- Yellow is a little weaker than the other colorsNote: we have also used the &#34;Big Drop&#34; from the same brand and it is far less interesting than the multi pack of small drops - if you are going to purchase one, go for this over the &#34;Big Drop&#34;"
0,1,"These are really cute, and they seem to be really sturdy gloves. My two year old is very big for his age, and they are a little big on him. I would say these would fit the average 4 years and up."
1,0,"These were purchased for my granddaughters, almost 5 and 6.  They fit them perfectly and comfortably!  Now I feel at ease as they help me dig in the garden and I don't have to worry about them getting their hands hurt. Just like adult gardening gloves! They loved them!"
0,1,"Great game! This is my 5 year old's favorite by far. I find it to be extremely educational. He seems to be able to breeze through the games on the first and second level, but the 3rd level is still a challenge. He's in kindergarten, but loves school and loves to learn."
0,1,This case is great and a must have!  I went ahead and bought this item to go along with the Leapster and other games we are giving to our son for Christmas this year.This case will hold 6 cartridges and the Leapster is well protected by a hard type case in front.  I think this is a great item!
0,1,This has been great for our leapster. It has been helpful with keeping all our leapster stuff together. It fits our 7 games that we have plus of course the leapster. I would say that there is room for more games too. I would definatly recommend this to store your leapster and games.
0,1,"The idea of this game is that the child helps Sponge Bob collect ingredients to create a new secret sauce. The animation is cute, but the games are too easy (my son is 4) and it takes too long to collect the ingredients. Once enough ingredients are collected, the child then gets to play ""kitchen chemistry"" which is not much fun. The child can either guess at the recipe or tap or SpongeBob to get it. Patrick does the taste test and it is funny to watch his reactions, but ""kitchen chemistry"" is just not exciting, interesting nor challenging enough to keep the child coming back for more.In addition to ""kitchen chemistry"", the cartridge has four other games:""Counting Claw"": Has 3 levels, deals with counting change. the child sticks coins into a slot until he has put in the right amount. My son blindly sticks the coins in the slot until SPongeBob reacts. Then he enjoys playing the claw machine game and the wacky prizes that come out. But he learns nothing.""Conveyor Chaos"": Very similiar to the bunny game that comes with the leapster system. Done a little better, but not very versatile.""Musical Garden"": The child only has to play with assorted sea music until the timer runs out. The child's symphony is not played back. Music appreciation?? Whatever.""Bubble Scrubber"": The one redeeming game on this cartridge. Unfortunately it only deals with 4 letter words. And there is nothing to entice the child to try more challenging levels. I did get my son to start using level 3 instead of 1 by playing it with him and now he prefers level 3. Although I do know the value of repetition, a few more words would be nice.After experiencing First Grade (which is still my son's favorite), I was disapointed. This game is only mediocore."
0,1,If your kid likes Dora they'll love this game.  Plays like an interactive episode of Dora and should keep them entertained for a while.
0,1,As all things......not made as it used to be....this game as a child was one of my favs it's got the same effect of a jack in the box.  You play beating the timer and try to get all the pieces in until POP the pieces pop up and out when time is up.  I don't know if this one is faulty or just the newer sad workmanship but the pieces don't jump like they used to and the timer does not seem to run smooth.  On a good note it's still a good game for hand eye coordination and shape learning in a fun way as I've used it for homeschooling my two kids.
0,1,haven't opened yet but it arrived quickly. The game is a lot smaller than i remember but I hope the kids love it as much as I use too
0,1,My son is 4 and has trouble with fine motor coordination.He loves this toy and it is perfect for OT (Occupational Therapy) exercises.Each piece has a small peg sticking out of the top (a small handle) which he has to grab and twist to make the shape fit.  He loves when it pops and makes him jump. We usually all do the puzzle together which is even more fun. Sometimes we even win !!!!
0,1,"This is great for a toddler fine motor skills puzzle.  It helps toddlers see differences which are needed in order to learn the alphabet.  I agree that the 10 seconds is too little of time, if you're using this toy as intended.  We do not use the timer at all and only use this for a toddler puzzle.  My 2 yr. old loves this puzzle."
0,1,This is a great puzzle for helping kids learn their shapes and numbers.  Matching games are an excellent way for kids to have fun and learn at the same time.  The pieces all come in a bucket for easy storage and for taking it on play dates.
0,1,We don't have TONS of furniture . . .just about 4 rooms worth and 8 of the little critters family members.  This house is the perfect size for my little 2 yr. old.  and she can carry it.  It holds all and keeps things together.  The colors are bright and fun.  Even big brother likes playing with it!!!  Good buy for the $$$
0,1,"oh so cute, I was a little hesitate to purchase this because thought it was a little pricy, until  I received it!  very, very well made and holds everything in it. My daughter even plays with it instead of house that she also got for xmas! absoutely worth the money! love it!!!"
0,1,I love this play house. Great for hours of fun. All you need is a living room set and a bed room set to start having fun. The case is well made and has pictures of the kitchen and bathroom on the sides. It also has drawers to hold all your stuff in the case. This case is great on the go or just for at home play. The price is a little high but well worth it for all the fun and enjoyment your little one will get out of this toy. If your child collects calico critters this is one thing you need to add it will pay off in the long run. Enjoy!!
0,1,instead of John Deere this is old Mc Donald to my grandson. he just turned 2 so for a year now he is called old Mc Donald and eio eio eio eio over and over
0,1,"This was a great addition for our grandkids.  They liked the animals, noises and music and play with it regularly."
0,1,"This is such a fun toy and my two year old loves it! It plays animal sounds and the &#34;Old McDonald&#34; tune. The wagons are connected to the tractor and cannot be pulled apart, which I love. The animals and the farmer can be used as bath toys."
1,0,"My 1 year old daughter really enjoys this toy. Originally, I purchased it for her 1 year old farm themed birthday party as a center piece. After the party was through, she played with the toy and had a laugh with all the farm animal noises. Great toy for any child!"
0,1,"Should have listened to the other negative reviews. My then 17 month old was very interested in these. However, to make them work you sometimes have to smash them together while they are inside the box. One of the animals completely doesn't work. Also, the pictures on the cubes are glued on so badly that they are coming off already, after only 2 months of play. Total waste of money."
0,1,"This was a great find. My daughter is 22 months old and it didn't take her long to figure out how it works. After playing with it only twice, she can now match up all the animals to make the sounds. This will keep her busy at her table in the kitchen long enough for me to get quite a bit done. She happily calls out &#34;did it!!&#34; every time one of the animals makes their call. I feel the price was very reasonable and I'm very happy with this purchase."
0,1,This is such a nice puzzle for 1 and up. I bought this for my 1 year olds for daycare and they love them even the older kids. Great price and shipping fast!
1,0,"I gave this as a gift to my 18 month old nephew. It is well-constructed and easy enough, yet challenging enough, to be durable and keep a young toddler's attention. A good purchase."
0,1,Nice little block puzzle for toddlers. Easy blocks to pick up and the sound effects are nice. A good thinking puzzle for the little ones
0,1,"Great toy, it looks and is made great, stands up very well to hard playing..."
0,1,I love the idea with these.  My toddler got these for Christmas.  The set was a bit smaller than I thought she loves it and love to play with it.  The fact that it is smaller is great for her play kitchen.
0,1,"I bought these cupcakes for my then 18 month old (she is now 3 1/2). There are 3 yellow cupcakes and 3 chocolate ones.  Each have their own shapes for sprinkles on the icing, and the knobby ""key"" that fits into the cupcake bottom matches the sprinkles in shape.  And the pan has a shape in each of the depressions.The problem-solving idea is to match the shapes up with the pan. Younger children/toddlers learn motor skills by removing and fitting the cupcake tops to the bottoms.  Tiny ones love the different textures that these cupcakes have, and also learn motor skills by removing and replacing them from/into the pan.  The colors are beautiful, and the plastic is mildly soft, yet very firm and durable.Immediately these toys became and remain a consistent favorite.  Being rather education-oriented, I intended for these to be used in such a fashion.  And they are, in so many variations!  All 3 girls go for them daily, whether it is to play kitchen or restaurant and ""bake"" them (the 6 and 3 yr olds), match the pieces(the 3 yr old) or chew and carry them around (obviously the 15 month old... well, sometimes the 3 year old too:) Any time cousins or friends come over to play, these cupcakes are incorporated.Yes there are some shapes that are more challenging to put together (the star and moon, mostly), but isn't that the point?  That's what learning and problem-solving is all about."
0,1,"I was definitely more excited about this toy than my 2.5 year old daughter.  I do think it has a lot of educational value as far as learning shapes go.  Unfortunately, they are a little difficult to pull apart and my daughter has lost interest quickly."
0,1,"I have a 1 and a 2-year-old and they both love this toy.  Obviously, the one year old just likes to torture the 2 year old by taking and running with the pieces but the 2-yr-old likes to put the pieces together and use it for our tea parties.  Great buy!  In fact, the baby apparently threw one of hte pieces in the trash, so I think I may buy a replacement set..."
0,1,I read the reviews before buying this and it is like everyone said.  It is a durable rubber or plastic.  It is very educational for my 4 year old daughter who is learning her letters and now how to spell since the name of the colors are written on the underside of the ice-cream.  My 18month old son loves playing with it too.  It is good pretend play along with it being educational.
1,0,Learning Resources products never let me down! These Ice Cream Cones are both education and fun to play with in their kitchen! So fun!
0,1,This was a gift for my daughters third birthday. She enjoys playing with this ice cream set almost daily. I am very impressed with all of the play food products I have purchased from Learning Resources. The material it is made out of is very durable. The names of the colors printed on the inside of the ice cream are great for helping little ones with color/word recognition. I would buy this set again if I ever needed to but the likely hood of that is small due to the amazing quality of this product.
0,1,"Our just turned four year old boy has been making ice cream out of Duplo blocks for a year or so. He has always enjoyed making up flavors based on the color of the blocks.  He is able to do the same imaginative play with this set and seems to enjoy it a lot.The scoops are a durable but very flexible plastic that is easy to wipe off and dry (the box has instructions to wash before use). My son has a little trouble getting the first scoop on the cone but stacking the scoops is very easy.  He would have needed help putting the first scoop on the cone a year or more ago.There is a very faint smell on the plastic right out of the box that reminds me of the smell of a flexible plastic Halloween mask.At four years old, I don't think he will get any concrete learning from this toy but he will get to use his imagination and practice healthy playing.For those wondering, these are made in China."
0,1,"My Grandaughter has this set & I just bought another one for a 3 year old little girl.  I love that the set interacts with the child - is well made and seems to last.  I would highly recommend this!  When explaining to them that this is what the doctor does - it makes their visit to the doctors office - routine not scary.  Lots of Fun!! They can take care of their dolly's, teddy bears & Mommy & Daddy too!"
0,1,"This is the best docor kit I've found. I purchased this for my grandson's 5th birthday, and he LOVED it! However, the case was broken where you close it, and a piece was missing from it. I sent the kit back to Amazon, and they sent another one to me. The new kit had a loose closure, and the stethoscope didn't work. Again, I had another kit sent and it FINALLY worked! Overall, I do recommend this kit. Just be sure to check it out thoroughly before giving it as a gift, so your little ones, (and you), won't be disappointed.UPDATE: My grandson has practiced his medicine on ALL of his family and friends, including his new baby brother. The doctor kit has held up pretty good, and all of his patients seem to be cured with his doctoring skills. LOL!"
0,1,"3 year old adores this, and just in time i got a nasty cold just so she could diagnose me :-/"
0,1,For quite some time I've been searching for a toy medical kit for my 6-yr old to play with. This one turned out to be nicely equipped and rather durable too. All components seem to be well made and allow enough room for kid's imagination. Good deal for the money.
1,0,My daughter loves to play doctor so Santa brought her this set and a crash cart for Christmas. This set is a great quality in comparison to other medical sets. The stethoscope has a heart bet sound when pressed against your chest. My daughter likes the otoscope to look into my ears and throat. The storage container is very nice and great for easy storage.I would highly recommend this set.
1,0,"My 28 month old daughter got this for Xmas and uses it everyday.  The pieces are durable and my daughter is very rough with them.  Even the glasses she has bent, stepped in, thrown, etc.  I can see this set easily lasting through another child.  And it's a durable case to hold it all in."
0,1,"Quality Doctor kit. after thorough research, I purchased this for my six year old twins for Christmas. Both of them love to play with it. The parts are durable and well made and allow for creativity. Everything fits neatly in the Doctor's &#34;Bag&#34; when playtime is over. Highly recommended!"
0,1,Daughter really loves it and plays with it very often. She works on her stuffed toys and other people if they let her. LOL.
1,0,"I bought this doctors set for my almost 3 year old for Christmas, along with the Doc McStuffin's kit for my 4 and 1/2 year old.  This was is much better set (albeit it doesn't have the &#34;Disney&#34; glam of a tv show to go along with it).  It comes with a lot more instruments - the phone rings, the pager beeps, the stethoscope coughs and has a heart beat and all the rest of the little pieces are wonderful and keep both kids entertained.  I've been &#34;checked up&#34; numerous times by both of them, they check each other and their toys.  Both kids end up using most of this kit instead of the other.  The only thing that could make it better is if it were in a black doctor's bag (my kids battle to open the box, which is probably a good thing, but they constantly ask me to open it)."
0,1,Very happy with my purchase!  I love this game!  If you like strategic and challenging games...you will love this one!
1,0,"This bike is great - especially for little boys who love motorcycles. I was disappointed the front wheel didn't turn (can't steer) -- but my 2 and 3.5 yr old do not notice or care.  They love the bike!  Some reviews said this bike was unsafe...but it is not - their child must not be ready to balance themselves on a ""bike"" using their 2 legs. The wheels are very wide and the child doesn't need to balance that much. I got mine at a yard sale for $5 - great deal.  Probably would recommend for an average height 2 yr old.  They do have to be tall enough to sit on it and have their legs properly touch the ground to ride it."
0,1,"I purchased this bike over a year ago for my son who is now two and a half.  He absolutely loves this toy and it is pretty amazing how fast he can go on it.  The fact that the front wheels don't turn doesn't stop him from either, he just picks it up in the front and turns it as he pushes with his feet.  Overall it is pretty maneuverable.I agree with some others who have written that this toy is prone to tipping, but I think this is a toy that kids can and will learn how to use as they grow into it.  After the first couple of days my son got the hang of it and hasn't had any accidents since, today he can even lift his feet off after a hard push and roll quite a distance without tipping.  I do think the toy is better suited to patios than the yard.This toy is well built.  I wasn't raised in the era of all plastic toys so I was a little concerned about how long it would last when I pulled it out of the box, but after a year of hard use we have had no problems.  It was easy to assemble and the stickers went on without any problems.  Bottom line, I would buy this for my son again, he has a good time with it."
0,1,Bought this for my 17 month old grandson. His big brother has a so called motorcycle and he wants one. So Santa needed some help...
0,1,"This thing takes up some space in a room.  Only buy it if you're prepared to have a huge giraffe in the room all the time.  It's not small, by any means.  But my little one loves &#34;Gerald&#34;."
0,1,"Great gift for a toddler. Very cute, life-like, and extremely sturdy and well made. Worth the cost. Considering buying other animals also."
0,1,I bought this for my sister who loves giraffe's. I got a great price on it and she loved it. Very nice quality stuffed animal. Size is true to what they said and is very impressive.
1,0,"My daughter is 6. When she was 5, we went to a Chinese auction and this was one of the prizes. She literally sat next to this giraffe and hugged it the entire auction, and I thought, &#34;Oh boy. If we don't win this, there are going to be tears.&#34; Actually, she was mature about it and even congratulated the winner. But I thought that if I could afford it, I would get it for her for Christmas. And then I forgot.A year later, I wondered if it would have the same appeal. After all, she's into things like Monster High and Spy Girls now. But I took the chance, knowing that my daughter doesn't tend to &#34;grow out of&#34; her favorite things.Well, I'm so glad I took the chance. On Christmas morning, this was the &#34;big box.&#34; She opened it first and said, &#34;This is the giraffe from the Chinese auction! I said that if I won it, I would name her Gina.&#34;I don't know how she remembered that, but there you have it-- Gina the Giraffe. She's very sturdy (despite that my kiddo keeps trying to sit on her) and looks spiffy in a pair of spy sunglasses. No idea where we're keeping this thing long-term, but she hasn't yet made it out of the living room, where she watches TV with us, plays games with us, and reads with us.A great long-term toy."
0,1,"Nice enough product, priced questionably. I would purchase again because it was exactly what I needed for a special gift."
1,0,"She love giraffes and this is one more for the collection. Seems to be well made. It arrived on time and most importantly, my daughter loves the giraffe."
1,0,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He had been asking for one, but everywhere I looked they were over $100, which I think is a lot for a plush toy. The price on this one was great and it is much nicer than the others. Mellissa and Doug make such great products. Love it!"
1,0,i love it!! My son love this giraffe!100% recommended!i bought it for my 3 year old son! :)
0,1,"This is overall a great seat. It's easy to install, it appears to be pretty comfortable, it is safe and solid. It is slighty quirky in three ways:1.) It is HUGE. My husband and I call this car seat ""the throne"". We drive a large SUV, and when this car seat is rear facing, the front seat must be pulled so far forward that the passenger's knees hit the dashboard. It also makes it so that no one can sit in the middle of the backseat... it takes up one and a half seats.2.) In order to loosen the straps, the toggle must be ""jiggled"" in a certain way. It's pretty quirky, but the instructions describe how to deal with this, and I honestly don't even think about it anymore... you get used to it pretty quickly. It does, however make it pretty difficult for someone ELSE to use your carseat. (Like Grandma, the carpool, etc.)3.) The straps have to be adjusted nearly everytime I put my baby in. There's no such thing as ""click and go""... I think it's so sensitive to different thicknesses of clothing, and if your baby is positioned slightly different than he was the previous time, the straps have to be completely readjusted."
0,1,"I read the good reviews before purchasing as a Christmas present.  My 12 month old grandson is extremely active and I thought he would enjoy hammering.  The set is well made and heavy.  We had to take the hammer away as he was trying to use it on the house windows.  The wooden balls are heavy and he throws them which he thinks is great fun, however the dogs now avoid him.  I think this may still be a good toy once he is a little older."
0,1,"We gave this to our Grandson for Christmas, and it's one of his favorite toys! Well constructed and bright colors!!"
0,1,"I bought this for my 10 mo. He likes banging on the drum, and it doesn't annoy me :)I don't give him the drumstick to play with - he is at the stage where he likes putting everything in his mouth - so he gets to play with that only when I am supervising him.But, a fun and well made toy!"
1,0,has a nice sound and design. The grandkids love it!
0,1,This puzzle is great for my 3 year old.  She is learning her solar system in school so when she completed the puzzle she knows what some of the planets are.  Perfect!
0,1,"The critical info you need when reading a toy review:A)  How old is the child using the toy?  My boy is just shy of his 4th birthday.  B)  Kids always love every toy when it's new - how has this one stood up with the passage of time?  Sorry - we've only had this puzzle for one day so I can't comment on its ""legs"".Usually I wait a while to write toy reviews because a parent can be misled by the child's initial reaction to a toy.  This puzzle, though, is so great that I felt moved to write a review after one day's play.  The graphics are great, the pieces are sturdy, they're not WARPED the way so many puzzles are even straight out of the box (I'm lookin' at you,Chuggington Bedtime 24 Piece Glow-In-The-Dark Floor Puzzlewhich basically ruined Christmas Day for us, with your insanely warped pieces), and it's educational.  My kid had a great time assembling this and was able to do most of the assembly without help from the parents.A+!"
0,1,"Great puzzle for our four year old.  I wish the picture was showing all the planets from the sun, instead of the moon.  In school, kids learn the planets in order from the sun and that would have made more sense."
0,1,"These are really lovely colorful puzzles.  They are nice and large when you lay them out on the floor, you can really admire them.  Not difficult at all for middle aged kids."
0,1,"I like this Gizmo- It could be made a little stronger but I would say it is made &#34;good enough&#34; and I would probably buy it again.  His little leg ripped off on day 1/hour 1 but it had some help from tugging of children.  After fixing, they were a lot more respectful and it has not happened again."
0,1,"I love this toy, but more importantly, my baby loves this toy.  We got it for her when she was 3 months old, and she has loved it ever since.  I proceeded to buy almost every toy in this line because she loves it so much!  My daughter, now 10 months, loves to play and chew on the hanging things, and she laughs at the face.  It is also very portable, and is small enough to bring anywhere.  It can be attached by the loop and velcro to almost anything.  An absolute must for any baby!"
0,1,"I purchased this for a friend who loved the Whoozit for kids. I had never heard/seen them until she mentioned it to me... ordered for her new baby. Very clever little guy, I'd most likely purchase for my next baby."
0,1,My son started really playing with this toy at about 3 months.  He is now 4 months and teething and he loves to bite on the cloth rings.  It is small enough that he will grab it with both hands and is excited when it is put in front of him.  He isn't old enough to play with the squeaker nose yet but I will squeak it and it gets his attention.  The velcro loop makes it easy to attach to things although it doesn't seem like it will hold once he is stronger.  I will buy this toy as a gift for sure!
0,1,"We have 3 of these- The bigger one, the baby, and the girl one. My daughter loves these! She likes to eat the legs with the shapes- and she recently started chewing on the nose lol. But we hang this from her car seat and she plays with it all the time. I highly recommend getting one to all parents, it's simple yet keeps the baby entertained!!"
1,0,One of the best toys we have! This is one of the few toys my three month old will pay attention to. He'll stare at it for 15-20 minutes and be completely entertained. Definitely worth the money!
0,1,Have had many hours of enjoyment playing with my Grandson. It is both a toy and a learning tool. Recommend
0,1,"As mentioned in the title, my 8 year old loves building things like this; so, I am surprised he has only built it up one time since its arrival approximately three/four weeks ago.  As for a description of the product, there are many pieces which is why I prompted my son to choose this one amongst the selection of others.  It does as it is supposed to do; however, it would be better if the pieces were more solid so as to make it more sturdy upon a completed structure.  Honestly, I don't know that I would spend my personal dollars on it; but, this happened to be a product my son spent his own saved dollars on."
0,1,I have two son's and we have now had this for a couple of years now.  As a matter of fact we have this put together in my living room right now.  If you rock it too much it will fall apart but my boys seem to love it even now.
1,0,"Bought this for my 4 year old grandson to play with along with me, but he doesn't seem to want to spend a long time with it. He does with other play but this particlar one doesn't generate the interest. We have been using it indoors and will add to get a mat or cloth to set the toy on to catch most of the sand spill over."
0,1,"How many times have you been putting together a puzzle and the pieces are so flimsy or cut so loose that the pieces will fit in any number of locations?  Too many to count and it is so frustrating!  Well, let those frustrations end with this puzzle as it is a very nice quality cardboard with the pieces fitting together snugly and none of those frustrating questionable pieces.  The cat has 'helped' and fortunately when he lays on top of the puzzle no pieces come loose so that is a bonus.  The photo quality is nice and clear . . . all in all I would say a very quality puzzle and I will be looking for more puzzles from this company in the future."
0,1,"My wife and I and grandkids enjoyed working this jigsaw puzzle over a period of two weeks. The image is pleasant and the pieces are very accurate in terms of fit, but the mix of colors and shades and shapes makes it hard to locate the piece you want. Some areas of the puzzle are much tougher than others as is true of many jigsaw puzzles. All 1,000 pieces were present and accounted for and the completed puzzle is so pleasant to look at that we may mount and frame it.  Ravensburg uses brilliant colors, quality materials and precision fits. There was no doubt if a piece fit or not. We are not huge jigsaw puzzl fans but we enjoyed solving this one and liked it being large enough that several people could work on it at once without getting in each other's way. We may get another one for the holidays. Good for hand and eye coordination exercise too."
0,1,I am no puzzle expert... this was my first in years... it was very challenging and quite the brain tease.  Excellent graphics and very rewarding when completed
0,1,"Once I get a puzzle finished, I usually frame it.  I use a foam paint brush and polyurethane finish.  It has always worked well.  When I found the Puzzle Conserver by Ravenburger, I thought I would give it a try.It is less messy than the brush/polyurethane and the applicator doesn't drip.  Apply a bit of pressure to get the liquid to flow and rub it over the puzzle.  Allow it to dry and you have your protective finish.  Be sure to get it into the ""joints"" of the puzzle pieces as well.The instructions say to rinse the applicator under running water but I found that you needed to squeeze the applicator as well to remove the residue so it didn't dry in the sponge and prevent you from using it again."
0,1,I've never used a Puzzle Conserver until I used this product.  I'm a puzzle freak and I do puzzles quite frequently.  There's been many times over the years that I've made comments about how I wish I could save the puzzles and hang or do something with but for whatever reason I never thought about getting anything like this.Now that I have this I've started conserving some of my favorites.  Now I just need to figure out how to hang them or figure out what else I want to with them.The product is easy to use and it goes a long way.  The finished product is clean and doesn't leave any bumps or anything that's unappealing.I think this is a great product and I would recommend it.
1,0,"Before I got this stuff I usedPlaid Mod Podge CS11223 4-Ounce Puzzle Saverto ""glue"" my completed puzzles together. And it did work fairly well, although it struggled to hold larger puzzles together and often created a white-ish finish. Ravensburger, however always seems to solve the problems that arise during puzzle-making. The applicator here is easy to use and it comes out in a foam for easy application. Simply apply a thin coat, allow to dry (it dries on very clear) and voil&agrave;! You have a firmly glued puzzle that won't crumble when you try to move it and will look beautiful framed.Rinse the applicator brush immediately so you can use the rest of the generously-sized bottle on your other beautiful puzzles! Considering this bottle is about the same price as Mod Podge and other brands, I say why not go for the best? So far Ravensburger has never let me down."
1,0,"I use this to hang posters, drawings, and other light things around the house.  I also used it to straighten a picture I had hanging on the wall which kept leaning to the left.  I just took a small piece and attached it to the back bottom left corner of the picture and that solved that.  Only four stars as I wish it was a little stronger.  It  could not hold a six ounce plastic frame onto a tile wall using four tabs, one on each corner."
0,1,"Very disappointed in this toy.  First, it didn't every work right.  We put the batteries in, but the remote never worked properly.  Second, you are supposed to use the controls in the top portion, but it seemed they were programmed backwards, and in essence, only made the car scoot a little bit and in the opposite direction you thought.  Finally, the top when put on is very durable, so my daughter can carry it around, but when she tries to take it off, it is very hard to do for the small kids.  Overall, I would not buy this at all for anyone."
0,1,"We had a good time with this.  It is a bit too fine motor for a two year old.  Using tweezers made it easier.  The four year old was far more skilled.  The ironing took some practice, you would think it would melt more quickly than it does, just be careful, there is a sweet spot between slightly melted and fall apart-not-ready.  I guess it depends on your iron.  Be sure the steam is off!"
0,1,"I loved Perler Beads as a child and was thrilled when my daughter was old enough to try them. They are just as fun as I remember! Its fun to create patterns and pictures on the bead plates; it is a great educational tool because it helps children count the beads, learn about colors and create patterns. The downsides to Perler Beads include the size of the beads -- small hands have a hard time placing the beads and if they fall out of place on the bead plate frustration mounts. The ironing of Perler Beads can also be tricky; if you don't get the iron hot enough, the beads won't stick together but if you get it too hot, the beads mush together and the design is lost. Overall Perler Beads are a fun project for boys and girls."
0,1,"OK, we got this for our son when he was 18 months old and it was way too high for him to ride (even on the lowest setting).  He's now 2 and his feet still aren't reaching the floor.  How annoying.  And friends of mine have this and have the same problem.  So, it just sits there most of the time."
1,0,I bought this as a gift for a 7 year old girl and she loved it.  Brings out the creativity juices.
0,1,"This football is nice and small for a young child. My son is only two so it's a little too big for him now, but in a couple of years it should be just right."
0,1,"My daughter plays with this food frequently, and some of the paint is chipping off after 1 year, but not much.  It's still in very good condition with quite heavy use (she throws them, bangs them in her pans, etc).  I would have expected them to be more worn/chipped, so I'm happy.  She has a giant bag of plastic food that I bought at a garage sale, and she almost never plays with that and prefers her wooden food to plastic.  I am going to donate the plastic food to good will to reduce my clutter!"
0,1,I bought this for my granddaughter to have in her play kitchen. It is educational teaching them the food groups as well as fun to play with! I would definitely recommend this.
0,1,"This is a very weak alternative/and or addition to Melissa and Doug's Playtime Fruits and Veggies. The items are not life-size and in some cases unrecognizable.  The little wooden boxes are nice for storing and would work better for a smaller play kitchen. However, the play food items are not life-size and in some cases unrecognizable.  If it had not been opened, I would have returned it."
0,1,My 3-year-old enjoys playing with the food groups in her Kidkraft retro kitchen.  The product is well made and fun to play with.
0,1,"I am a big fan of educational toys but I believe there are much better ones on the market.  This toy is loud and obnoxious.  I agree with the reviewer who felt the screen was dark.  I also feel that it is hard to manipulate.  Also, the quality is not what I would expect from fisher-price.  Even after a battery change, the screen refused to advance.  Returned to the store within days."
0,1,I bought this for my 3 year old daughter for christmas last year. She has hardley touched it but my 1 year old son Loves it. He sits there all day and plays with it. It is a little annoying because of how loud it is even with the volume control but I put up with it cause my little guy likes it!
0,1,granddaughter loves it - delivered as promised
0,1,"Love this!  My kids love this!  It's great to practice their Jiu Jitsu moves on and it was $20- cheaper on Amazon.com than in the local Martial Arts studios.  Well worth the purchase.  We filled it with water and it's weighted perfectly for my 5 year old.  My 10 year old uses it just fine too, but you can tell that she's soon going to outgrow it as far as strength goes.  When she kicks it, it slides away about six inches.  Actually, she loves that because she feels powerful.  :)"
0,1,"This was a Christmas present for my nephew. The in - laws liked that since he's only 2 right now, that this will grow with him."
0,1,"I purchased this for my 4 year old's birthday based on all the positive reviews. After I purchased 4 D batteries, I put the thing together, with a very eager 4 year old by my side. What a bummer it was to have it put together, and have it do hardly anything. The baseballs were very, very slow to come out. Not to mention this toy is LOUD! But back to the actual function of this toy. It's horrible. The balls are slow to come out, if they came out at all. Or perhaps one will come out, but then it would turn itself off. It also appeared to shut itself off if the 4 year old was too slow to add the balls back to it. Overall very disappointed with this, and it's going back."
0,1,overthought her tball gift. she never ever uses it. Likes standard tball instead.That and its just too light to easily stay upright in the yard.
0,1,"This will be a fun activity for my 3 yr old grandson and his neighborhood friend.  Its a good practice for the little guys to learn to take turns with the ball.  They love hearing the cheers  &#34;goal&#34; !!  I noticed the price jumped a large chunk after I bought it, I would not have paid that for it."
0,1,"The frame is metal and seems pretty sturdy, the net is ok but wish they would have made it so that it would be further back like a real soccer net.  The sound thing is very sensitive and plastic but does give my preschooler a reason to keep on kicking the ball into the net.  I think he has more fun playing soccer with the dog (the dog is happy too).  I do like the fact that it's sturdy but light enough to play on the back porch when the weather isn't nice enough for outside."
0,1,I purchased this as part of a Christmas present.  My grandson loves playing with this fun toy during these winter months.
1,0,Grandson loved this he played with it all of the time and was able to do allot of practicing
0,1,"I bought this toy to keep my 6 month old entertained in the car. She didn't seem interested in it except for the toy that was attached. Sometimes when you press the horn, it doesn't go off. Other times the slightest little nudge will set it off. Sometimes every bump I hit on the road would keep setting it off. It was a little anoying. Also there should be more of a variety of noises."
1,0,This was a gift from a family friend. It din't attach to the carseat properly therefore placing it on my daughters laps just made her mad and she would kick it into the floor. I DID like the remote....when it worked. And the music...well...could of been better.
0,1,"My son got this toy when he was about 9 months old and it fast became one of his favorites.  He loved that he could make the train ""go"" on his own!  We have low pile carpet and it doesnt have a problem rolling on the carpet which is nice.  The train comes with a sampling of peek-a-block types, sounds, visual, animals, etc.  It came with plenty of blocks to have fun with too.  My only complaint was that initially it was frustrating for our son since not all the blocks that came with the fit on the train portion that spins.  I wound up sorting out only the ones that would sit and spin on the train so he wouldnt get frustrated."
0,1,"We purchased this for our son when he was 9 months old and it's been a hit since day one!  He loves pushing it around and making the blocks spin, hearing the music/train sounds and the red flashing lights.  It really grabs his attention and keeps it for a decent amount of time.We have wood floors, so there is no trouble with the locomotion.  It also works on our area rug, which is pretty low pile.  I can see that it would have difficulty on regular or deeply piled carpet--although the child can still manually push it.The educational value of this toy includes teaching cause and effect; putting things together (the caboose comes off); and if you play with your child, you can teach him/her about colors, shapes, etc.The blocks do fall out easily, and I noticed some paint rubbing off along the top edges soon after purchase (because he'd push it along upside down).  But overall, the quality is great--a very solid, well made toy.Highly recommended!"
0,1,"Keeps my ten year old away from video games for some time. It is educational and recreational, what else can we ask for? Some advise: do not get the little balls wet, just in case, because we had another toy with similar metallic balls, which got rusted in a cleaning operation my 6 year old daughter did once."
0,1,"I used this seat a little when my son was young, it reclines enough for newborns who cannot sit up on their own.  He could sit up and see what was going on or watch the occasional video I had for him.  We have been using this seat a lot now that he is eating solids.  We are very pleased with it.  I used it in the reclined position to start with since he couldn't sit on his own.  Now he sits all the way up and eats from it three times a day.  It is very easy to ""operate"", easy to clean, and the back pad comes off easily to wash.  I even take it to Grandma's house!  I would recommend this to someone who doesn't want to take up space with a hi-chair and possibly needs something portable."
0,1,"I used a zip tie to tie this to my son's 12&#34; bike with training wheels.  It is secure and he can put his snack, toys, sticks while riding around.  Had it for awhile but still in good condition without any rusting."
1,0,"Works perfectly with the Kettler Air Navigator. The basket is small - but then so is the trike! We can put quite a few small library books in it, or a few truckes for the park, so it is practical. We have not noticed any stability issues with the basket  and are very pleased with it!"
0,1,"If I had it to do again I would not buy this basket; the yellow storage bucket at the back provides ample storage room, and the basket is just something that comes off easily and frustrates both my toddler and me. Don't bother with this product."
1,0,"This toy is made up of 2 islands attached by a bridge. One one island, there is a palm tree (when you pour water into the palm tree, swiper's face can be seen through a knot hole), and there is a tether to anchor the boat to the island.  On the second island, there is a slide that dora, diego and boots can slide down.I agree with many of the other reviews that knock this toy for it's lack of durability. First, the palm tree isn't attached to the island, so it keeps falling into the water. Then the leafy part of the palm tree doesn't stay attached to the base of the tree. The boat tether doesn't hook into the boat well, so that basically doesn't work at all. The bridge doesn't stay on, so the 2 islands keep floating away from each other.About the only things we kept from this toy are the boat, the characters and one side of the island to use the slide.Luckily I got this on clearance from a toy store that was going out of business and paid next to nothing for it. This is not a great toy - and not much fun."
1,0,My little boy loves this train.  It is well made and he has enjoyed playing with it on this train table.Great buy.  Any other place is so expensive!
0,1,I bought this for my son who has a collection of thomas and friends!this is a good quality he even showers with his trains.
0,1,"Murdoch is a mighty engine with ten drive wheels. He was brought to the Island to help with the heavy workload and pull freight on the main line. As shy as he is strong, Murdoch can often be found seeking peace and quiet.This wooden train is a 2 piece set, joined with magnets. My son loves playing with this mustard-yellow engine on his wooden tracks. Very sturdy construction, and a great addition to the Thomas line!"
0,1,"If your child enjoys acting out the Thomas & Friends episodes, Murdoch is an engine designed to pull heavy freight. He's the largest engine on Sodor, and has a butterscotch sort of color, like Annie and Clarabelle do. Shy as he is strong, Murdoch wishes for some peace and quiet, but his friends are always full of questions.Murdoch and Arthur are unique engines. They are the only large engines in the wooden range with 2 wheels in front and 6 wheels in back. All the other large engines have 4 wheels in front and 4 wheels in back.If you could use a heavy freight engine every time there's more milk, logs, cattle, or other various cargo to deliver, Murdoch is highly recommended!"
0,1,Wish I would have read the reviews here before buying.  I was tempted to return it also.  I got this when my daughter was two months because a friend recommended getting a toy she could kick.  Well she kicks it alright but the thing never responds.  I even called customer service thinking something was wrong with it.  I had to smack the thing really hard to get it to work.  The fisher price rep told me the settings are different sensitivities but I am not impressed.  I am encouraged by the other reviews and maybe she will like it when she is older.  She is almost 3 months old now and seems interested in watching the lights on the continuous setting.  I wouldn't recommend this for a newborn as the box suggests.  Live and learn.
0,1,"I bought this for my daughter at 4 months, because I liked that the toy can grow with her from laying down to sitting up.  But I sure wish I had read these reviews before buying it.  Like everyone says, the music is very loud and super annoying.  When she would lay on her back it was awkward for her to kick straight ahead to hit the base of the toy.  She did kick the spinning toys pretty good and that would thrill her for awhile.  But even then she couldn't stand to play with it for more than 5 minutes tops.  Now she can sit, but she is not yet old enough to place the balls in the spinner so they go down the ramps.  The only use we get out of the toy now is when we hold a spinning toy in our hands and she bats at it.  Certainly not worth the money I paid for it."
0,1,"My daughter loves this toy.  I had initially purchased the Baby Whoozit as a fun portable toy, and she loved it so much I bought her the big one for home.  She loves to laugh at the face, and play with the rattles and squeakers.  The hanging toys are also great teethers, and she enjoys chewing on them."
0,1,"we received the whoozit as a gift - I thought it was so ugly and wanted to give it away - instead we gave it a chance over the changing table - our son just loves it!  he stares at it, ""talks"" to it, laughs and squeals in delight - I am now a whoozit convert - don't knock it 'til you try it - looks like it works for 90% of babies..."
1,0,"My son LOVES that Elmo ""knows his name"" and at the age of 19 months he plays with him everyday. When we first got him Elmo would say ""Oink like a bird"" or ""Quack like a Lion"" but then about 4 months ago he all of a sudden would say the correct phrases i.e. ""oink like  a pig"", quack like a duck"" etc. Obviously they have some quality control issues but it is what it is and now it works and my son loves him!"
0,1,"I bought this for our grandson Ian a few months ago. Its so cute and really does teach a small child a lot about animals. Very clear, easy to handle and operate and bright colored which I think is important to small children. Its a great buy and will provide hours and hours of entertainment for a small child. A must have. I liked it so much that I pre-ordered the new ABC one for another grandson."
0,1,"My daughter has had this toy for about 2 years and has rarely played with it.  She does, however, have two of the old ""classic"" see and says that the neighbor kid gave us.  The old ones get more play time for sure.  The ""quiz mode"" is too complicated for the younger ones.  If they don't know how to answer the question, it will get stuck in that mode until someone gives it the correct answer."
1,0,"I loved See and Say as a child, and I couldn't wait to get one for my toddler. I got this for him when he was 16 months old. If the toy actually worked consistently, it would be great. But half the time, we pull the lever and it just spins without saying anything. We have to pull it just right, kind of slowly, and have it on one of a few select animals, then it will work. When it does work, he loves it. I'm really disappointed."
0,1,"It seems that we have had a toy like this in our household forever. From the time my children were little to now sharing them with my grandchildren.  This one is adorable. The pictures are colorful, the sounds clear and it sure does bring a smile to the little ones. I think it's a great teaching tool and just a wonderful way to share another precious moment with the child you love."
0,1,"The slides do not go together as it should - and it's clearly not a single faulty unit.  We're going to try superglueing it together as our daughter really wants this.  Her other Polly Pocket toys in her collection are of much better quality, it seems to be just the slides... Talk your child into some other Polly POcket item than this one.  Or buy glue ahead of time."
0,1,I purchased this for my 2 year old at the same time as I purchased the big one of these for my 6 and 8 year olds. I thought that the big one would be too big. This one is perfect for him and his little hands. It lets him be like it big siblings but be able to manage this too. Very cute and fun!
0,1,Read through the reviews for hints about ways to use this sand table. THis is a fun activity center. In our windy area we took the umbrella off completely. It is very heavy when full but wiht a little bit of help you can move it. The thing that struck me about this toy the most is that it is very sturdy. With three kids and several neighborhood kids coming to play this has seen a lot of use and it has lasted a very long time. The colors haven't even faded. Well worth the investment. Enjoy.
0,1,I bought this for my sons 3rd b-day. The kids love it!!!I was conserned about the legs leaking because of the crapy design. I put it together and put some UV6800 self leveling glue on the plugs. It is uv proof and water proof. It created an air tight seal. If I ever decide to take legs off I still can (The Plugs will just stay on the table. We love it!!
0,1,"I read all the reviews before I purchased this for my 5 year old so I'll try to address the complaints of the other reviewers.  First of all my husband could not believe the box said the toy was for 4+ kids.  I think it would take at least a 10 year old to be able to assemble the toy by themselves.  And only a 10 year old that was good at Legos or following Ikea assembly instructions would be able to put the toy together.  So parent participation is definitely required when assembling the toy.  Now that said, it was easy enough for my 5 year old to put the pieces together if I gave him the piece he needed and told him where it went.  Overall, assembly was easy fairly easy, again you have to be familiar with following Lego or Ikea instructions and if you aren't then I would say assembly of the toy would be a bit more difficult for you.  Now the complaint about the carousel falling off is valid.  But it only happened when my son would run the gears nonstop.  If you pulse the gears and let it run for only a few seconds at a time then the carousel was fine.  But try telling a toddler to ""pulse"" the gears right?!  The roller coaster is also a disappointment because the coaster tumbles down the track rather than sliding down the track as if it doesn't fit on the track.  But in the end, after it was all assembled and my 5 year old had played with it for a bit, he said ""this is so cool"".  Hence the high rating.  Would I recommend the toy to others?  It depends on the aptitude of the person I'm recommending it to.  If it's a parent that is willing to sit and play with their child for at least an hour then I would recommend this toy, but if it's a parent that doesn't have that kind of time to play with their kids then they will only find this toy an aggravation."
1,0,"For the love of god why isnt there an off switch to this toy.I got on the metro with this puzzle in a bag after receiving it as a gift. The whole time I heard sirens going off. It was horrible, my son doesn't care for it either, he takes the pieces out and flings them across the room. That would be great if the sounds would stop too but they don't. Super sensitive! If I breathe in the same room the haunting sounds of the puzzle are heard from the toy box!Pros: Its a puzzle good for learning. Seems sturdy?I will only buy this to spread the misery to another parent. muah  ha ha !Cons: No Off switch. Super sensitive will go off at ANYTHING! The sounds are not that great anyways."
1,0,"This is a great puzzle. The sounds are not realistic. The are loud and annoying. The pictures are great, but it could use a vocal tune-up."
1,0,"I love this puzzle and my daughter does too.Most of the pieces can go in different spots, so there's not always only one right answer.The doors are surprisingly sturdy even after many uses.I lost two pieces and called the manufacturer- the replacement pieces are on their way- no questions asked.I like the magnetic feature.  It keeps the pieces in the puzzle more than the average puzzle.Overall I am always pleased with their products."
0,1,"My son loves anything tractor, mower or tool related. He's all boy. This drill set is great. We've had no issues with quality. He plays with it often and enjoys making new pictures. Great activity!"
0,1,"So many of this kind of toy are for girls, using beads to make flowers and butterflies.  Not this one...this one is much more boy--drills and screws to make flags, boats, etc.  There actually is a butterfly card included and some other more typically ""girl"" pictures.  But the colors are primary rather than pastel, so even those don't seem as girl-y.  What's even better is that my son LOVES it.  He has had it for 2 years and STILL loves it.  At first he had trouble following the pattern cards himself, but now he's really good at it and often asks to play with it.  His 3yo sister also loves it.  She doesn't follow the cards as much.  She just wants to screw and unscrew the pieces into the board.  There are PLENTY of pieces, but only one drill.  Fortunately my children don't mind using their fingers, so they can both play at once if they can settle on a pattern.  I highly recommend it.  Fun, fun, fun!"
1,0,"My 4 year old son didn't use the templates but just started digging into it, making his own patterns.  He had no interest in taking them out, though (funny?) Once they were full, mom had to take them out.  The drill is not too loud or annoying, the batteries last a long time (not much interest in the screwdriver) He can take this into the garage and &#34;work&#34; with dad.  Cute!"
0,1,"This toy was an immediate hit on Christmas-- everyone wanted to play! It has held up well; no problems with the drill, and continues to be fun for my 2-year-old.My son doesn't use the patterns at all, he just likes to do his own thing.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the drill is not strong enough to 'unscrew' the bolts if they have been tightened using any of the hand tools, leading to a little frustration.Overall, though, a great toy!"
1,0,"My son is 3.5 years old and seems to only like the drill for this toy.  If I sit down with him and have him drill into the board, he will, but mostly, he just uses the drill on other things."
0,1,I purchased a leap frog lmax and this is one of the games i purchased for the system. my daughter is four and this is her favorite game right now. She gets to draw earse paint and stamp. THey let her pick from coloring book pages and have learing games where she can trace the letters and even has drawing lessons. It is a great investment and keeps her busy.
0,1,"This is my children's favorite cartridge for their Leapsters.  I bought this one for my oldest son 6 (now 7) whot loves to draw & is constantly doing some sort of art project ... He has yet to loose interest in it.  My middle son who is 5, is always borrowing it for his game system too.  They both love to use it and get to make some pretty great free style drawings.  I would love to see another similar game with some new stamps, colors & color book pages."
0,1,A must for any kiddo with a Leapster.  A fun game that teaches mechanics of drawing and writing numbers and letters.
0,1,Good game for the little picture drawers in your life. Our kids love to draw and doodle so this keeps them busy with that whenever they want. Not a bad little game. Our kids are 5 (twins boy & girl) and they both enjoy this. I would recommend to anyone who has a kid out there that likes to draw...
0,1,Great for a younger child easy to play and minimal buttons. Not very durable though for regular rough use of a child. Still was worth the money since the price is reasonable.
0,1,"This was a Christmas present for my seven-year-old son.  He loves Bionicle action figures and educational computer games, so I figured this would be right up his alley.  While it was the center of attention for about 45 minutes on Christmas day, the novelty wore off quickly not just for my son but for the rest of my kids (ages three and six).  I'm a big kid at heart and enjoy a good toy about as much as my own kids do, but this didn't hold my attention for long, either.The problem is Robosapien just doesn't do very much.  It comes with a remote control that lets you control its direction of travel, arm movements and sounds.  The most interesting commands are the two preprogrammed routines that put the toy through its paces and highlight all of its functions.  But after you've seen it dance around and belch a half dozen or so times, you come to realize you've seen it all and 'all' isn't much.  The toy travels rather slowly when walking and turning, so there's little of the enjoyment that you get from commanding, say, a remote-controlled car.  Its hands are not good at picking things up, either.  Objects must be precisely located along the side of the Robosapien, and it has difficulty grasping most things unless they are of a particular shape.  There's no artificial intelligence that you can put to the test here--this is just a remote-controlled humanoid robot.  It can react to certain stimuli like sound, but it basically just does what you tell it via the remote.Robosapien is an interesting novelty item and a fun toy to play with for a couple days.  But its limited functions don't hold a child's attention for long.  This was easily the most expensive gift my son got for Christmas, and it has sat in his room almost untouched since a few days after he received it.  Much less expensive toys have done a better job of keeping him entertained.  I think even kids older than my son will grow bored of it fairly quickly, especially if they have access to some of the more sophisticated computer games that offer far more interactivity.  With better mobility and some semi-decent artificial intelligence, Robosapien could be a fantastic toy, but it will probably be several years at least before that level of technology will be found in affordable kids' toys.  Sony does make such a toy (a robotic dog called AIBO), but it's big bucks."
0,1,"Got this for my grandson's first birthday.  He was a little too young for it, but now is a few months older and it's just right.  He enjoys riding it when he goes for walks with his parents."
0,1,"We got our daughter the Dora quad for her 1st Birthday, and she is now 3 and still rides it (battery gets same use as day 1)! So, when our son recently turned one we got him this one and he loves it just the same! Actually, both our kids ride this around together and it is still decent speed! We store the charging cable under the seat so it's never lost..  I think we will repaint the Dora one for our daughters upcoming 3rd Birthday to make her feel a little more special since it has SO MUCH MORE LIFE left in it!"
0,1,"There are TWO different pink leapsters currently on the store shelves. This battery recharger works fine with the ""old"" pink leapster that looks like the ""original"" Leapster (more heart shaped) but does not work with the NEW pink leapster style (more square/rectangular shaped.) Here at Amazon.com, if you click on the picture of the old-style pink leapster, it takes you to the product page with a picture of the ""new"" pink leapster, just to add to the confusion. At first glance you may not notice the difference in the way they look, so observe carefully.I was disappointed they didn't have different colored back plates for the rechargeable batteries to match the color of the Leapster (appears they only come in silver.)"
1,0,"This is a lifesaver compared to going through batteries every week.  It works as it should & once it is on the base correctly, it stays charging until complete. I never had a problem with the light going off. Great product."
0,1,"Pros:-Blows lots of great bubbles!Cons:-As some other reviewers also said, broke after a few months of infrequent use (less than 10 uses)-Comes apart very easily; a little tricky to put back together-Tips easily (backwards)-Sucks up batteriesIf you can get it for a great price, I would recommend it.  It works very well when it blows bubbles.  Just don't consider it a long term toy, and don't let the kids near it; keep it up high to prolong its life!"
0,1,"This is a great little gift for a kid 1 to 3 years of age (maybe older, I don't know much about gifts for older kids).  The price is great, and it puts out tons of bubbles.  At this price I don't have high expectations for it working for a super long time, but its a fun little machine and my 15 month old loves it.We received it as a gift, and I've since given it twice I liked it so much.  Combine it with a book or extra bubble stuff and its a nice little gift idea!"
0,1,"This is a great bubble machine that produces a lot of bubbles very very quickly.  You will have to shut it off after a few minutes, or you will go through your bottle of bubble liquid in 10 minutes or so, will have to refill.  Definitely buy a big bottle of bubble liquid to go with this machine, if you are going to use it for a while.  Kids have a blast, it is perfect for parties.  You have to be careful moving the machine once you put the bottle upside down (it has a valve that you put on the bottle, then you put the bottle upside down on the side of the machine), then the liquid moves into the green area of the machine, in which the wand dips into the liquid, and then a constant air stream on the top portion of the machine blows out the bubbles.  When you move the machine too quickly, the bubble liquid can slosh around in that green basin and come out.  It is best to put it on a table or something up off the ground, as if you put it on the ground, then it seems like 1/3 of the bubbles go on the ground and pop.  There are other bubble machines that are out there, that have a handle that could be moved with one hand, this one if you are going to move it, you should put one hand on the upside down bottle, then the other one for the machine, or the bottle can easily fall off the machine.  This one is more compact than the others I have seen."
0,1,"I picked this up because my kids love bubbles.  I worked nicely and became a favorite.  I think it got the big head, though because it quickly decided it was too good to work.  It stopped working properly and began clicking and the wheel turned.  It wasted a lot of bubble fluid also.  I was upset when it completely stopped working around 4-5 weeks after purchasing.  This equated to maybe 10-12 days it was actually used...If you're looking for a good, reliable bubble maker, consider 'Amazing Bubbles Bubble Generator ' here on Amazon.  It as lasted me near 7 months now."
0,1,"Returned it. The motor would get stuck and stop turning. Would not even make one full revolution. Vibrates all over the place when it does run. If it's on a smooth top table, it'll vibrate in circles till it falls off the table."
0,1,"My two year old recieved this as a present and it has been a hit with every member of the family. I am shocked by all of the negative reviews - we have had NO bad experiences with this toy. I would buy this for my friend's children. The motor is quiet, the machine fills the room with bubbles, and even a young child can operate it.The concept is really simple - a child pulls down on the handle and bubbles come out the top. The handle springs back to the carrying or up position and the bubbles stop and the wand is automatically re-soaped.After reading some of the negative reviews, I did some experiments and discovered that if you don't empty the entire bottle of bubbles into the machine, you will not get bubbles. You can't be stingy when filling this thing - just go ahead and fill it up. That having been said, it does not blow through bubble solution all that fast. Even with frequent play, I only had to refill it twice a week. Refill bubbles are cheap and the amount of bubbles and smiles this bubble maker produces is well worth the $$ you will spend on bubble solution.I highly recommend this toy."
1,0,"My daughter almost 1 enjoyed this toy, but it stopped working and it was not rough handled.  I like the concept, but it simply is not well made.  The lights and sound no longer work and my return window is closed."
0,1,This is a nice toy.. it lights up and makes a nice sound every time you put on one of the stars or take them off.. the light keeps them busy and they really play with this one. It well made and still after a year it lights up and looks brand new. Great product.
0,1,"My son is still too little to understand stacking the stars back on the stacker, but he loves activating the music and watching the stars light up to different classical tunes. Fisher Price has made a classic toy even better with lights, music and multi-colors. Makes a great baby shower gift."
0,1,This was a gift for our son.  He doesn't care so much about the stacking rings but loves hitting the top bottom to make the song play.Because of the side button (that chimes when a ring goes on or off) it can be more difficult to get the rings on and off.  The top light has also burnt out on the toy and there is no way to replace them.
0,1,"My daughter loves the lights and music.  She plays with all of the rings also, even before she could really use the stacker.  I would recommend."
0,1,"My 6 month old daughter loves this toy!  The star shapes are easy to grasp and the toy ""twinkles"" and plays a sweet sound every time a star is removed or placed on the stack.  The star on top is a little wobbly but actually makes it easy for her to remove.  When you push the top it plays a song which brings a huge smile to her face everytime she hears it.  It plays nice classical music at a perfect volume.  This is a great variation on the typical ring stacker!"
0,1,"My daughter got this as a Christmas present when she was 4 months old, and it wasn't until she was about 9 months old when she started really paying attention to it.  She doesn't yet have the dexterity to stack the stars, but she loves dumping the toy upside down so the stars fall off.  She likes watching me peer with one eye through the hole in the stars, and she even does it herself.  And the stars are easy to grasp and bang together.  Her favorite thing about this toy is when she pushes on the top button with her finger to cause the music and lights to start up.  That always makes her smile.  This is one of her favorite toys, but I think it will be awhile before she is using it to its full capacity."
0,1,"My daughter has loved this toy since receiving it for Christmas!!  She is able to take all the stars and top off easily and the lights and music are extra incentive.  The curved bottom makes it difficult sometimes when she knocks it over, but she has since figured out how to tip it back up.  She even loves watching the lights when the stars are not on the stacker."
0,1,"My son had this toy when he was a baby almost 10 years ago, and it was one of his very favorite toys.  So, I had to buy it for my daughter, too, hoping she would like it just as much and that the toy had remained the same.  To my surprise and happiness, it was a yes on both counts!  The clear, bright jewel colors of the rings on this stacker mixed with the blinking lights make this toy colorful and sparkly and a delight for my child, and for me.  The rings have different textures for sensory stimulation which is another plus.  When you stack the rings on the post the post lights up and songs play.  You can also make the songs play by pushing a small button on the top of the stacker where the star head sits.  The star goes on top and you can push it up and down for music and lights, or leave it off and push the button by itself.  The only thing I don't like about this toy is that the star doesn't sit on top very well, it is wobbly and falls right off most of the time.  But, the music is upbeat and not annoying to me at all, which in many toys is a rarity, and it means my child can play it over and over and over again without giving me a headache!  The base is not flat, it is curved so the toy can rock back and forth on a hard surface.  I also like to buy this toy as a gift because I have never seen a baby that doesn't enjoy it."
0,1,"It is a bit annoying for the parents, with the sound and the music and all those lights, but the babies adore it. Also the music and sounds, I must admit are quite whimsical (just turn annoying after a while, like any other toy). My son still plays with it and he is 2 and a half... And the batteries last very long. We just changed them after a year and a half."
0,1,"We bought the How Tall Am I? game for our 2 1/2 year old.  It is a simple game, yet fun and perfect for her age. This is her first game and it is teaching her how to roll the dice, follow directions and wait her turn.  Our 5 year old enjoys playing the game also and the two have a good time together.  I don't know how long the game will hold their interest, since it is so simple and there is not a lot of variety, but for now, they enjoy it and it is teaching our younger one basic game playing skills."
0,1,"My kids and I like playing this game.  I would give it a ""b"" overall.  My critique is that so many of the pieces are so close in size, that when you are finished building your person, all 4 of them often only vary by a centimeter or so - I think the concept would work better if there was a bigger variation in the size of each piece, so the cumulative size when you are finished building your person would be more varied.  Still work the 12 dollars you would spend, much more fun that learning the concepts thru a workbook."
0,1,OMGosh - these are so much FUN to make. You do have to be patient though and you must follow the directions. Do not be in a &#34;hurry&#34; to finish this project. It takes a few days to a week for the finished project. On these flip flops be sure to put the white stones where they say or you won't be able to determine the sandal strap from the bottom of the sandal. These are such an awesome gift to give - very creative - a really fun project to do with your kids or grand kids - but remember it is a MESSY project - but sometimes messy is fun!!! Highly recommend.
0,1,"Little scientist loves it!!  He has found more things inthe house to view and study.  It is simple, but shows magification fairly well."
0,1,"I knew my daughter was well under the recommended age for this product but she loves Disneyland so I thought this would be a nice gift to play as a family. The board is beautiful which makes things fun. The problem mostly is that my daughter is too young for this game. She gets the ""Attraction"" cards and doesn't want to go there, she wants to go where SHE wants to on the board. In a couple of years this will probably be one of her favorite games. I would recommend this game to families who enjoy Disneyland/Disneyworld and who have children within the recommended age range."
0,1,"my 3 year old loves to play with this in the bath.  he'd seen it on a you tube video and wanted one.  as a grown up...it's a little awkward, but it's not for me."
0,1,Small and not well made.  For the amount of cars we buy these companies should make some well made toys to go with them already.returning.
0,1,"This is great logic games for kids K-3rd grade. The goal is to guess where the different members of the family are, by answering yes/no questions.It is simple enough to not frustrate them, yet challenging enough to keep their interest and help them develop deduction skills.In some ways, it is similar to ""Guess Who"", in some others it is similar to ""Battleship"", brought down many many notches.One thing I like about this one better than ""Guess Who"", is that in ""Guess Who"" you have very few female characters, so if you get one of them, then narrowing down the person is very easy. Here, every instance of the game is equally challenging.One of the weakest aspects of the game is that there is no straight forward way to keep track of guesses that were wrong (for example, if you wrongly guessed that the girl was in the hallway, there is no way to mark it down -- you either have to remember it, or come up with a way to remind you -- for example, laying down the character over the room that was the wrong guess).The game is reasonably well built, and the small pieces all fit and store inside the ""houses"". We've had this game for over a year, the kids have played with it quite a bit, and no pieces have broken or got lost."
0,1,"Ok, the game is fun and all, but I got it from K-mart when it very first came out like 3 years ago for only $40 brand new. Like a year later, I seen it at K-mart on clearance for $20. I'm not kidding.... This is way over-priced, and I would recommend looking to buy it elsewhere."
0,1,"This is a bargain. My child learned to walk with it right away. As for it's use as a riding toy...it is a bit low to the ground and did not work well for my very tall kids but that may just be us. This is a good gift nonetheless. The kids enjoy it and like that it ""vaccuums."" The blocks are always a hit."
0,1,"we bought this for our 9 month old son and so far he's loving it!  He doesn't much care about the blocks, but is really into the bright colors of Mr. Hippo and loves crawling and walking behind it.  It took him a day or so to get the feel for  balancing behind it, but after a couple of days, he's a pro!At $25 it's a real bargain, unfortunately we paid twice that in Europe."
0,1,"My daughter got this toy for her first birthday and she absolutley loves it!!!!  As soon as we got it out of the box and put the handle in place, she was off on a new adventure.  Although she hasn't yet figured out how to put the blocks in front of it for the hippo to gobble them up, Im sure she will soon.  This is a perfect gift for any struggling walker!!!!*****5 Stars***** and an A+++++++++++ All the way!!!!"
0,1,"Ordered this for my daughter's 4th birthday. She is obsessed with cats, especially kittens. She absolutely adores this toy. It it very cute. Kitten colors varied from picture."
0,1,"My one year old loves this! I got to go along with &#34;Mama's Milk&#34;. She is always walking around with a kitten in each hand! Although it gets four stars because after a month of having it the mama cat's whiskers are falling out. But, she doesn't seem to notice."
1,0,"Why aren't there more companies that make nursing animals?  Nursing Nina is so cute!  I purchased one for my girls - ages 2 and 11.  (It's a big age difference, but this is one of those toys that can be loved by all!)The toy is well made.  They're nicely proportioned, made from lovely soft material, have high quality stitching, etc.  The kittens' magnets are strong.  The only downside to the quality is the mama's whiskers.  They aren't well attached.  It wouldn't deter me from purchasing this set though.This isn't a complaint or anything.  I just wanted to mention that one of the kittens I received was black, rather than they grey that is shown in the photo."
1,0,He got his first one several years ago.  Just recently lost one kitten and spent his own earned money to buy the whole set again.  He is a cat fanatic.
0,1,I'm happy I discovered this expansion for my 2.5 year old's train set. The switch pieces that split off in different directions are very useful. Now his train set splits off in multiple directions. Plus I love that it includes two male-male pieces which are a lifesaver! Great set.
0,1,Arrived for Christmas and discovered that without other sets this set could not make a circle. What a disappointment for a 2 year old.Just wanted the train to go around and the pieces did not form any typ of circle.
0,1,My 2 year old loves to build track sets with his trains.  This set was perfect to complete his exsisting set.
0,1,"Got this for a 10 year old's birthday gift. He loved it- his whole family loved it - his teacher loved it. It is endlessly fascinating. If you doubt me, and if you can even find one in stock in a store someplace!, show it to your kids and try to get them out of the store without buying it!So simple, easy to stow away and doesn't contribute to toy clutter, and very inexpensive for the amount of play your kid and the family will have with 20A over the months and years."
1,0,"I love this plush lamb rattle. I am hosting a little lamb themed baby shower for my sister and ordered 3 of them to place on top of her diaper cakes. They are the perfect size and just adorable. She is also decorating her nursery with little lambs and these are by far the cutest lambs that we have been able to find anywhere. When they arrived, my 4 month old daughter did not want to let go. I plan on ordering one for my own daughter as well. The softness and plushness is perfect for a little one to hold and cuddle."
0,1,"Like most babies & kids, my 18 month old grandson, Brando loves Elmo! This plush is the perfect size for packing under the arm and going to bed with. Special character that will ALWAYS be a winner with the little ones. Thank you Jim Hensen--you left behind a treasure. Peace"
0,1,Elmo is our little guys favorite character on Sesame Street. I bought this for his first birthday and hold it while singing the Elmo song...  Little Man smiles and hugs Elmo like crazy.  Gund quality and Sesame Street brand.  Good stuff.
0,1,"This is a really soft, cuddly Elmo.  The only complaint I have is that when we received him, he had a musty smell, like he had been in storage for awhile.  We were able to get rid of it by airing him out before we wrapped him up for Christmas and it is fine now."
1,0,"My toddler loves these Gund dolls.  We have several Sesame Street characters.  The quality is great, they wash well, and hold up to being dragged around everywhere!"
0,1,"My 2.5 year-old son fell in love with this at ToysrUs, so guess what came home with us after I saw how much fun he had playing with the store model? He loves this silly thing, though I sometimes wish the microwave beeps were quieter or there was volume reduction button somewhere on it.He ""cooks"" me pancakes and eggs in the morning when I make my own coffee, then sits next to me at the big table sipping out of the little cup, saying ""mmm, hot coff"". It's so cute, I want to cry! He's had it a week and a half and seems to like it as much as the first day, so I am glad I got it.The price, considering what some of the ""realistic"" plastic kitchens cost--some are $80+ people!--is reasonable to me. He mixes in his dollar-store plastic food with the stuff that came with this and is as happy as can be making popcorn, cooking croissants and making ""milky shake"" for daddy in the little mixer.He kneels in front of it or sits on the floor to use it, but so what? I do that when I sit with him to play with his bigger toys and then he copies me anyway, whether he could stand upright or not.Great gift for a boy or girl due to its gender-neutral coloring (not too pink or purply) and a fun one, too!"
0,1,My 5 year old daughter received this as a gift. I didn't really expect her to like it as much as she has. The table that attaches to oven is worthless though.
0,1,I got this for my daughter first B'day. She loves to sit and play with this. Only thing I hate the door comes off so easy.
1,0,"This is not an educational game. It is a fun game. In the words of our six-year-old who got it for Christmas,""It's really fun. I like the spinner best, the part where you have to get a mermaid together or a crab together. My dad had a hard time with the frogs. I won the game.""Every product we've seen from Cranium so far is a 5-star product. Darn impressive."
0,1,We've had this for two years and it's still fun.All ages can play.. modify it up for the older kids or adults.. simplify it for the  younger kids.It does seem to be a long game... we have yet to ever fill all the holes on the purple playing pieces.  The playing pieces are all purple and look alike.  They need to brighten these up a bit to stay with the colorful theme.
0,1,My 11 month old loves this toy. I bought it due to it's high rating and I am not dissapointed. She loves taking the birds in and out of the little house. The colors are bright and it looks very durable.
1,0,"Kids love to put things in and take them out. This little birdhouse is one of many toys that allow kids to do so over and over. The clear sides allow them to see if there is anything inside. The four birds (included) are colorful and cute and make a little noise when shaken. The lid lifts up a little to allow for additional in and out areas. There is a nice variety of colors, patterns and textures.The only problem we had with ours was that the clear plastic is not as rigid and ours bent a little over time. It did not take away from the playability of toy though.This one is a keeper. It's just too cute to give away even though my kids have outgrown it!"
0,1,"Already saved the price of them in paper (usually my important ones), pens (again mine), walls (ours) and frustration!  Kids (3&4) love them, get LOTS of drawing practice & they seem to be very tough (the toys)!"
0,1,We have a smaller version of this...these are the best...kids love them!!!  Our daughter fell asleep with hers in hand...great learning use to write letters and numbers...imagination with pictures.  Great to take in the car also.Great gift!!!  We have 2 and they go with us everywhere!!!
0,1,Just what I was looking for. My 2 1/2 year old loves it.  Good size. Soft. Arrived just as described.
1,0,"...Absolutely loves this. She's had one for over a year and so we bought a second for her to keep at Nonna & Nonno's house. If Cookie Monster is your child's favorite Sesame Street character too, then you NEED to get this for him/her."
0,1,These are fun little gadgets.  I only tried them once before I wrapped them all up as xmas gifts.  So far I have good reviews from the various 3-6 year olds they went out to.
1,0,My daughter laughed and laughed when she received her ugly doll.  She thought that he was just adorable and that he could be used for hugging and it's big and flat enough that it can be used as a small pillow.
0,1,I bought this for my 19 month old but she was very frustrated. It is too difficult for her to work. It is a very well made toy and very good for fine motor skills. I will put it away til she is a little older.
0,1,"I love that you can make multiple options with these toys.  It allows kids to be creative while also working on their gross motor skills.  It is easy to transport, and is fine if the little one chews on it."
1,0,"WOW despite the other reviews, I thought these would be on the smaller side - a nice travel toy to keep busy while away from home but they may be too big for that. They are much bigger than I thought they would be - they are more like building block sized pieces. Love the toy & very nice quality."
0,1,"This looks like it would be great but it only comes with six monkeys which is what the picture shows so this isn't a surprise.  However, with six monkeys and six holes to place the monkeys into, that is all my children do with this toy.  If there were more monkeys than holes I think the children playing with this toy would understand that there are several ways of placing the monkeys on the tree.  This is not a very stimulating toy for my children unfortunately.  However, this is the only toy we have been unsatisfied with from Plan Toys so I can't complain.  Maybe with time my children will experiment more with this one.  As for now we have a tree lines perfectly with six monkeys.Update:  One of our monkeys lost an arm.  Not certain what would be the best glue to attach the plastic arm to the wooden body."
0,1,"Love that they are stained vs. painted.  Liked the variety of shapes.  Do wish the ends of the strings had the plastic stiffeners on them - hard for a 2 1/2 yr old to get through  - though I guess it is supposed to be a challenge.  However I think it frustrated my daughter the first time she played with them so she hasn't wanted to try again even though I keep pulling them out.  Will try again in a few months.  Also, as previously reviewed, the colors are not &#34;basic&#34; red, green, yellow, blue so it is hard to use to help learning colors."
1,0,"My godparents bought these for my two year old off his wishlist. I had read the reviews and was already a Plan Toys fan. These are by far the nicest blocks I've ever seen and have just made me a bigger Plan Toys fan!They are SO smooth, and exactly the right size for building ""big towers"" by my two-year-old!The number of blocks you get is good, too. I worried at first it was a small set, but my son thinks they are great! (And he does have other blocks that just sit in the toybox now!)I can't say enough good things!"
0,1,"These are small blocks, also known as &#34;table blocks&#34; because, well, they're better played with on a table or a hard flat surface.  The don't stand up very well on our carpet, but it's probably because it's rather plush.  The rectangular blocks are about the width of iPod nanos, and the cube ones are about the size of 1/4 a block of butter.  I bought them as a complimentary set for our PlanToys 50 Unit Blocks, but she plays with these on their own.  The smallest block would be the 2 that are shaped like pyramids (you can see one in the far bottom left corner of the picture, sitting on top of the blue block), so you might want to put those aside if your child is still mouthing his/her toys.  My daughter is 2 years, 3 months right now, and understands &#34;don't eat these&#34;, but even so, I watch her when she plays with these.  These are solid wood, nicely made and balanced, so they won't fall over on the table unless you knock them over.  If your toddler throws things, though, these may not be the blocks for you, as I can see they can cause some damage when thrown with enough force (or they could hurt someone too).  Toddler says:  small size is easy for small hands to pick up and build a princess castle, and the different colors mixed with the natural wood is fun to play mix-n-match with.  Get these!"
0,1,I love the Plan Blocks sets.  The Fairy Tale Blocks and the Castle block sets all coordinate with this one.  The colors are beautiful and decent sized.  Love the texture of them-so much better than plastic!  Wish there were people figures with it however to extend the play value.
0,1,"I love PlanToys, but my son quickly pulled apart the excavator toy. That was rather frustrating as these are expensive little toys."
0,1,"Moy 3-year old loved this and it instantly became his favorite.  After all the plastic junk I am really loving these toys.  The body is simple wood construction.  The wheels are plastic.  The cars are wonderful and cute, fit in little hands.  Support this company."
0,1,"My son is obsessed with cars and has the Plan garage, so I thought he'd love this. However we ran into the same problems other people have mentioned, namely that the back gate won't stay closed and the front and back come unhitched constantly. In addition, after about an hour's use I discovered the wooden piece that makes the back gate had cracked and is now broken. This is going back."
1,0,Great item from plan toys. My son loves to fly it around and the pilot is removable. Works great with the plan city set.
0,1,"I bought this for my Grandson's Easter basket to go along with his city road play carpet.  I had read some of the reviews saying that the propellers broke off and I bought it anyway because I had purchased a lot of the Plan Toys vehicles to go with his carpet that I loved.  I anticipated seeing the helicopter without a propeller when I went to visit him, but it is still in tact and seems quite sturdy.  As with all the other Plan Toy vehicles, I think this is a great product."
0,1,I don't understand what people are complaining about.  This company dressed these dolls in kimono type clothing that is of the Asian culture.  What is the problem?  If you went to Asia or celebrations in American I am sure you would see Asian people in such clothing!  You are looking at a wooden doll with painted on simple features and I find them to be very cute!
0,1,Even better quality than we expected! Our only complaint is that we would have liked even more road pieces. This set integrates nicely into the train set we already own without the imperative of a whole new product line. The pieces are very easy to fit together.
0,1,"We have lots of Plan City pieces, along with Brio and Thomas trains.  This set added some extra road pieces that we were lacking.  Nice little set by itself, or as extras."
0,1,One of the best toys we've ever purchased. Plan City toys are expensive but worth the investment. I'd recommend pairing this with the garage and a few more cars.
0,1,I love this garage set. It has been surviving in a house of three toddlers ranging in age from 2 to 5. Some of the kids have even stood on it and it is still fine. It works great and is going strong.
1,0,"We were looking for a garage for our large collection of toy cars. This is a well made, sturdy product with a little car wash and an elevator. It even comes with one vehicle. Strangely, the kids didn't really use it. It is pretty pricey and didn't get much use. If you know your child will use it and enjoy it, then worth the investment for the quality. However, it just wasn't a hit for us."
0,1,"We recently purchased this dollhouse for our twin daughters' 2nd birthday, and we couldn't be happier! We love how they can access the rooms from the front and the sides--excellent for when they both want to play. It was easy to put together and the quality is just what I would expect from Plan Toys. We chose this dollhouse because we knew it would stand up to hours of play for years to come--my sister bought this same dollhouse for her daughter over 10 years ago--subtle differences in design/style, but good as new. We also love the option of adding another floor in the future. And the Plan Toy accessories are absolutely wonderful and durable!I must admit, I have as much fun playing with it as my girls--I even made new cushions to resemble our home--so much fun for the whole family. Educational in so many ways, too. You will not regret this investment in your child's stash of ""must-have"" childhood toys."
0,1,"Probably my daughters favorite part of her dollhouse!  Such a cute set, what fun!  The tiny baby is adorable and the little crib and stroller are really fun.  The changing table doesn't get much use except by the older kids who know what to do with it."
0,1,The nursery is very cute and I like that it includes a baby since the Hape family I bought did not include a baby as one of the dolls. What is the point of having a nursery without a baby to put in it?
0,1,We already have a wooden dollhouse by another maker and I we needed a baby and nursery set.  This is a bit on the big side but my daughter doesn't care and we are very happy with purchase.  Items are well-made and built to last.  Thank you.
1,0,"...but my kid likes them. I think she wishes she could change the clothes, but I am glad she can't. The mom's hair got a little freaky after a while, but it is yarn, so I am not sure it wouldn't have with gentle play, either.Good set!"
0,1,"Very cute set, however our set was missing one of the vegetables.  I have contacted the company to see about a replacement."
0,1,My twin grandsons love playing and making things with legos.  It helps encourage their creativity and provides hours of fun for them.
0,1,"Until I purchased these plates, my son was just stacking like-sized Duplos together and that's it. Now, he builds towers, buildings, animals, you name it. I just wish they came in a larger size as well."
0,1,"This is such a great toy for my little one. We are using it on the ground, without it's legs right now AND he loves it. He will be using it as a table as soon as he can stand up a little better. He plays with every toy on it and laughs. It is one of his favorite toys, and he has tons of toys."
0,1,"I bought this for a 10-year-old boy for Easter. His first comment was 'So cheap'- which in Alaskan terms means it's a bad gift. With that being said, he hurriedly pulled it from the package and experimented with it. His 'cheap' toy seemed to be a lot of fun. There are two settings- slow and fast (making the voice seem lower and higher). It's very easy to use and for any child that can read the directions it's self explanitory. I'd recommend it for kids ages 7 to 11. It records a short message (about 20 seconds in length) and then plays the voice back. You can alter the voice by sliding the 'mixer' up and down to make it lower or higher. Very simple, very easy to use.He really seemed to enjoy his gift and spent a lot of time trying to make 'ghost haunting' recordings. It came with batteries so it was ready to use right out of the package. It's small, handheald, and plastic- but it seemed fairly durable. He dropped it a few times, but it worked flawlessly even so. I know he would never admit that the Easter Bunny did a good job- but he really doesn't have to. It's kind of obvious, haha! I'd highly recommend this for any mischevious young boy. It's sure to give them hours of fun for a super affordable price!"
0,1,I love LeapFrog products and so I jumped at the chance to buy this for my 12 month old daughter.  The concept is great and the sounds are appealing.  I wish the buttons were a little easier for my baby to press.  It is quite heavy too. Pretty happy overall however.  I think it will be useful in the car/stroller as well as at home.
0,1,"I personally love this toy. It's cute, the music is pleasant and it makes learning fun. The only bummer, and it's a major bummer, is it's hard for my child to press the buttons - and she's 15 months old! The only one she can easily press is the first button. The rest of the buttons have too much padding in front of them and a small area to press to activate it. It makes her frustrated and upset when she tries to press the other buttons and can't. Toys are supposed to be be fun not frustrating. Every once in a while she gets one of the other buttons to work. But I find she doesn't play with it very often probably because it's not much fun for her. I'm hoping that as she gets older it will be easier for her to work it. I can't believe they rate this toy for 3+ months. I hope something positive will come from this toy and she'll learn not to give up! =)"
0,1,"This toy is awesome.  I bought it for my first child and she loved it.  I was going to get it for my second little girl for Christmas this year, but won't be buying it on Amazon.  $43????  Seriously????I'm going straight to the LeapFrog website.  Way Way overpriced!"
0,1,"I bought this for my 1 year old and she loves it!  She hasn't figured out how to put the pieces on the barn, but she loves taking them out and she goes crazy over the music.  She even removes it from the fridge and carries it around the house."
0,1,"Yes, this toy is cute and amusing to my not yet 18 month old son, but when Amazon features in large lettering that all pieces for this item can be stored on the back of it for easy travel, and I receive it to find out there's really no way to do that, I consider that false advertising. There are magnets on the back just a few of the pieces can stick to, but it certainly doesn't hold all of them, nor would I travel with it that way. That was the feature that sold the toy to me. Now I have another toy with numerous loose pieces to keep track of. We're keeping it because, again, my son likes the toy itself, but Amazon really should not be advertising this item that way."
0,1,"This is a matching toy for the refrigerator.  It occupies my son (18 mo.) while I cook.  He loves it.  It has cute songs, and praises the children when they ""make a match"".  Highly recommended"
0,1,"Another Leap frog hit in our home! Right now our fridge has the Farm Animal set on 1 door and the phonic alphabet on the other door!  My daughter will also take the farm off the fridge and walk around the house and then come back and place it on the fridge! I love that this set teaches colors and lets children create all sorts of animals, even when it's not a correct match. It says the colors of what animals have been selected, says their name and says what the 2 animals might say if they where an animal that roamed around the farmyard. When an animal is matched correctly a zippy little song sings you made a match! Just another awesome product from Leapfrog! You just can't go wrong getting this for your child! I sugguest your fridge have both this and the Letter Phonics set. No fridge is complete without them!"
0,1,"My son played with this toy, only few times. He doesn't seem interested in it at all. Very dissapointed!"
0,1,"This is a great baby/toddler age toy.  I haven't met a kid that age yet who didn't love it.  It's a wonderful distraction in the kitchen...they let go of your leg, quit whining, and start dancing and playing even if they are hungry."
0,1,"This is a fun toy to have on the fridge!  My daughter received this toy as a gift for her first birthday.  She instantly loved it and eventually learned to put the animals together.  She mostly loved to press the farmer TAD button and dance to the music.  It is a fun, educational toy that all kids should have!"
0,1,"My daughter got this for her first birthday.  She loves this toy!  She has a bit of trouble getting the pieces to fit, but I'm sure that will change with time.  She loves pressing Tad to play the farm songs.  She walks over to the toy, presses the button and then dances.  It's been great while I'm cooking dinner!"
0,1,I highly recommend this toy.  All children love animals and it is a great way to learn colors!!!!!
0,1,"My best friend bought this for my son.  Despite its appearance as just another noisy toy, it's actually quite a lot of fun.  The toy has different pieces so you can mix & match animals.  If you get a correct match, it tells you a bit about the animal.  If you get a silly match - ""A Pig Cow!"" - it makes you laugh.  It also plays some other farm-themed tunes and my son was dancing with it.  It would be a good toy for the car except for the fact that the pieces could easily get lost.  It is, on the other hand, small enough to travel with.  My two year old takes it out every few days and plays with it.We do not have any magnetic surfaces in the house, so it would probably be more fun if we did."
0,1,This Leapfrog toy is GREAT. The magnet is so strong that it doesn't fall off the fridge when a child is taking the magnetic animals in and out.  It's educational and fun. My granddaughter dances to the songs it plays after she's achieved a match.  I would highly recommend this toy.
0,1,"Our toddler got it as a gift when he was 14 months old, he looooves it so much, plays with it every day, several times a day, dances to the music, has fun placing and removing the animal parts. One of his favorite toys. I also like the fact that it teaches vocabulary, such as the sounds animals make, the name of baby animals, etc. The recording quality is very decent. The handle helps our toddler carry it around the house. He dropped it oh so many times and so far it is working great."
0,1,"I bought this for my 3-year-old daughter the other day.  It is better than I anticipated.  Firstly, It says the denomination of money deposited. It then tells you either a famous president is on the coin or what combination adds up to the amount deposited i.e.: a quarter=$.25 or five nickels=a quarter.Secondly, it sets small goals for young children to attain and keeps a running tally of the money deposited.This bank is made for preschoolers to help them understand the concept of saving money and to help them learn the monetary denominations of the coins they put in.My daughter was very proud of herself as she approached her first $5.00 goal.  She could care less about the ""mechanical gears"" on the inside.  What intrigues her most, as with most 3 & 4 year olds, is that she is learning how to save BY HERSELF!!"
1,0,This is a great game for learning.  Our son is going into the second grade.  We really wanted to be able to make the transfer into the higher teaching level easier.
0,1,"product was cute, I hated putting it together, but the shipper was good too,  fast I got it sooner than I expected."
0,1,This crib did take me a little while to assemble!My daughter loves it and I love that it has that handy little cupboard underneath for all of her baby gear.  The mobile is actually my biggest issue.  You have to hand-thread the stars and hearts onto the mobile and make sure that you are not making the strings too long so that it hits the crib as it cycles around.  The plastic clamp to keep the mobile suspended over the crib broke when I was tightening it - so I ended up having to glue it onto the frame.Overall: okay quality but really cute
0,1,"I bought this to go along with the canopy crib.  My granddaughter loves it.  She was 2 yrs old when I got it for her last Christmas.  Even though it's 9 mos old, it still looks new and she plays with it all the time.  It is made with sturdy wood, and like the crib, easy to assemble.  She loves her dollies so she plays with this high chair a lot, with many dolls sitting in it, waiting to be fed."
0,1,"Everyone who loves Bratz will love the Bratz Twiins. They are great! It was a wonderful idea of MGAE to make twiins! It isn't ""One of them is bad and the other is good"", It MEANS to everyone who doesn't know, one of them likes to ""Spice things up"" and her fashion sense is more spicey, while the other one is sweet as sugar! Personally, I LOVE the twiins! Roxxi is beautiful and she comes with great clothes! Phoebe is so sweet and cute that it's gorgeous!I give them 5 Stars for education because they teach you that you can be anything you want, it doesn't matter that you LOOK the same.I give them 5 stars for fun because you can have great fun with them! Two bratz in one! An amazing idea!I give them 5 stars for durability because they do NOT break easily! They are VERY durable!A GREAT gift for anyone!"
0,1,"I bought this toy thinking it would be good to use on my doorway jumperoo.  The jumperoo has two rings on the two front suspension straps to hang toys on.  But when I got the Whoozit Activity Spiral, it turns out it is very tightly coiled, like a spring; not flexible or bendable.  It is difficult to uncoil it or to stretch it out.  And there is no mechanism to attach it to things.  Although it seems to advertise that you can wrap it around anything, this is completely not true.  There is no wire or anything inside it to attach it with.  If you feed it through a hole, it might stay.  But in the case of my jumperoo, it wouldn't stay hooked on, but just coiled back up and fell off.  So then I tried it on the baby's carseat.  Again, it wouldnt' stay on.  It was too short to wrap a coil from each end around the bars of the car seat, so it would just slide up to the top of the bar as it contracted, or it would fall right off.  IF it were made of something stretchier, or if it had wire inside that would allow you to wrap the ends around something, it might be good. I think the baby would like the little dangling toys on it.  But as it is, it won't attach to anything we have.  And when it is so tightly coiled (as it is all the time unless you're stretching it out yourself) the toys are all jumbled up in the coils and not visible or reachable for baby.  So to me it is a pretty useless toy."
0,1,"My husband and I put this bed together in 10 minutes.  Everything is straight forward with easy to read instructions and pictures.  I think it would be hard to put together alone as one person has to hold the bed/rails while the other screws the headboards on.  The ""mattresses"" are very thin, but they are easily replaced.  Also, I would not let a toddler near this toy.  It's too tempting to crawl up onto the top bunk for a wee nap.  This toy is not sturdy enough for that.  We think our granddaughters will love their new doll bunks, and new dolls to go with it, for Christmas."
0,1,"Our daughter suddenly has a revived interest in her baby dolls, so we bought this for her 6th birthday. She loves tucking her dolls into bed at night, and this provides twice the room. It was easy to assemble, seems sturdy enough for the way she plays with it, and at a reasonable cost. Very pleased with this purchase."
0,1,This is a cute little bunk bed that fits bitty baby and american girl dolls.  The price is FAR cheaper than anything you will find from AGD store or catalog.
0,1,We love this product.  My daughter learnt the different shapes quickly and in a fun way.  The audio helps.  The only problem I find is the sensor used.  Its light sensitive not touch as I would have expected.  It kind of starts blurting out the shapes if lights go on and off in the room or if you are watching the TV in a dark room (responding to light intensity change with scene change).
0,1,Lots of great tricks. Easy to read and easy to use. The carrying case is neat because it can be used as a display as well. But all the tricks have a hard time squishing back into the box. Parts can get everywhere.
1,0,"I ordered this for my 8 year old grandson.  When I opened the box and saw all the Chinese and Egyptian art on the pieces, I have to say I was a bit turned off by it.  I decided not to give it to him after all.  I am sure this would not bother most people, but it appeared mystical to me and just doesn't fit in with our conservative Christian views."
0,1,"I looked at many magic sets before purchasing this one. I do want to say I am partial to Melissa and Doug toys, they always are quality made, even the puzzles. I was a bit afraid this set would be a little hard for a 7 yr old, but it is perfect. The directions are easy, the tricks themselves are study, made of wood-not plastic-and really beautiful colors and designs. I did buy the Magic hat with the bunny it (another item) as this did not come with a hat (that was a hit as well and worth the 17$). The tricks are very crafty but easy to learn for the child. We took on learning one trick a day and now she is a magician! You may need a cape and I bought one here for about 4$. The box does turn over to make a little stand you can set on the table and they can use to perform. I wish Melissa and Doug made a set to use after this one!"
0,1,"My son wanted a magic set to replace an old junky one he had gotten a couple years ago.  Most of the old set was broken or lost.  We saw this set online. From my previous experiences with Melissa and Doug items I had hoped it would be of the same nice quality I came to expect.  I am pleased to say it is!!  This set is really cool in looks AND in its functionality, and durability.  My 9 year old son really likes it, says its much cooler than his other plastic set, and has been mastering all the tricks (all very do-able for a kid 8+).  The tricks are for kids to master as they are pretty obvious for adults to figure out.  But I think it is also educational in that a lot of magic is a bit of science...and he is learning a bit of showmanship as well as he performs these tricks for people.  I highly recommend this set...it comes with plenty of start up items to make a kid interested in magic quite happy, and the durability of most all the items will make the parent happy too!"
1,0,"These snap bracelets are not worth the money. Each bracelet is a piece of metal covered by a sleeve of flimsy animal print fabric with a seam going all up the bracelet and then sewn shut on each end. One of the ends wasn't sewn very well (on all 12 of the bracelets), and had quite a bit of fraying fabric sticking out. There were also small stickers on each bracelet (I think they said Made in China or something like that) that had very strong adhesive. When I went to remove these stickers (after all, Santa's elves don't work in China last I heard) the fabric actually ripped on a couple of them and I had to throw them away. It took me about half an hour to remove 12 stickers, if that gives you an idea of what a pain it was. I would definitely not recommend these bracelets -- Santa and his elves really goofed this time."
0,1,"This is a nice size chest that fits my son's pirate costume, his fake parrot, compass, a book about being a pirate, a pirate map, his other pirate hats, sword...you get the idea.  We gave it to him for Christmas and he loves it.  It's durable, but we've warned our son he could warp or break it if he tries standing on it because it's made of plastic.  (Boys will be boys.)  The lid sits securely on the top of the chest but doesn't snap into place."
1,0,"This toy arrived almost completely ASSEMBLED!  Even the stickers were attached!  The best part about this toy (from a parent's perspective) is that it all fits neatly inside and you clip the top shut.  It has a carry strap for taking on visits to Grandmas.  The music is loud enough for play but not too loud and it plays more than one song.  The magnets really hold the ponies on the dance circles very tightly.  Even baby ponies can dance.  If you are only buying one, I recommend this over the amusement park with ferris wheel.  This holds together and the amusement park falls into several peices and is very difficult to store.  My daughers love the music and motion of the Dance Studio."
0,1,"This is a truck a kid can really play rough with--sand, dirt, rocks--it can take a beating.  It's stronger and more durable than I could have imagined.  Could not be more satisfied with this purchase, and it was incredibly reasonable at only $[...]."
0,1,"We purchased two of these trucks about 3 years ago for our then 2 year old twin boys.  I have to say it is one of the best purchases we have ever made.  We have a total of 6 kids (ages 3-11) and still to this day, this is the number one fought over toy.  Whenever they are outside they all want to play with these.  They have been left in the weather, brought along on vacations, used hard and are still kicking, which is a lot more than I can say for most toys that have been through our household.After 3 years of hard use, they are still in pretty good shape.  A few rust marks and dings and the plastic has some sun fade, but still plenty of life left."
0,1,"I purchased this set for my 18 month old son and he uses these utensils all the time.  He loves trains and is becoming more opinionated by the day, so this Thomas the Train set makes mealtime fun.  The handles are smooth and easy for a toddler to grip.  I have washed these in the dish washer many times over and they are still in good condition with the Thomas design still intact.  I would purchase this again as a gift."
0,1,"First a word about customer service. My first bed arrived well packed and shrink wrapped, but I noticed a crack in one leg. In less than 10 minutes with Amazon, I had a return label for the damaged bed and had received an email that a new one was on the way!! Great Job since this was a birthday present. 2nd bed was just fine. It took about 5 minutes to put together ( Melissa & Doug include the tool)  What is so great is the the bed is already painted, the expected Melissa & Doug quality and comes with a mattress, pillow and blanket. Great price since you get such nice bedding and almost no work. My granddaughter loved it"
0,1,It is just as sweet as it looks.  It was bought for our 5 year old granddaughter. She loved it. Perfect for her baby dolls.
1,0,"My baby gets a proud look on his face when he ""plays"" his piano. It is so cute. I think he is developing a fondness for music."
0,1,This product came on time and in new condition.My daughter loved this gift.She played with it for hours on Christmas Day and slept with it that night.
0,1,"Great piano, great size. Baby loves to bang on it and play. Seems to be well made. Colors are nice."
0,1,"I bought this for my son, and although some people were disappointed by the tune of the piano, I could care less. I actually bought this for my son to bang on, not learn how to play the piano. He absolutely loves it! He will once in a while try and climb it or push it and it will tip over rather easily. So much fun for me to play little tunes on and for him to bang away!"
0,1,"The good news: Product was well enough packaged in plastic shrink wrap and end cushions, shipped a larger box with a bit of paper thrown in. No visible damage from shipping. Color and finish was good.The bad news: The top right key did not work at all. The rest of the keys were barely close to tune. The Learn to Play piano should be close enough to tune to identify with the keys while learning to play simple tunes on the little piano.Physically cute and colorful, makes fun noises, seems to be durable, but misses the point of learning to play even at a basic level."
0,1,"I wanted to love this piano. After reading reviews, it seemed like the best choice of first piano for my daughter. She's too young to learn how to play but she loves music and trying different instruments (she's 2, under the recommended age for the product).When my daughter first saw the piano, she thought it was a step stool because she hadn't seen a tiny piano before. Once I showed her how she can press the keys to make sound, she tried it out and seemed to enjoy playing. The letter strip indicating keys is a good way to help the little ones understand each note is different. She enjoys reading the letters out loud while she hits the keys.The problems I have with the piano are from the parent perspective. It sounds pretty awful. I knew a tiny piano wouldn't sound like a baby grand but this doesn't even sound like a piano and is completely out of tune (hard to listen to). Some of the keys have to be pressed multiple times to make a sound, which reduces the learning/reinforcement that pressing a key will make a sound. The piano also is easy to tip over. We ended up setting it up against the couch so it won't tip over. It's not a lightweight product so if it tipped onto a toddler, it could hurt. Before we moved it, the piano would tip over each time she played. Kids are tough on their toys but this piano lacks bottom weight to keep it upright when played hard (I don't mean pushed/tipped on purpose).Overall, my daughter likes using it occasionally, and I know she'll play more with it as she gets older, but I wish it sounded better and was more stable."
0,1,"So the LITTLE piano came today.  It was a lot smaller than expected.  My biggest problem and this is huge for me because my son cannot be around scented things, was the horrific smell. Even before,opening the box, I could smell it. To me, it's a combo of harsh chemicals and moth balls.  I have the piano sitting in the garage to air out but an overnight airing out may not do the trick. It's definitely not worth the 50 bucks I paid for it. Would like to return it, but its too difficult for me to get it shipped out. I would definitely steer clear of this. I m hoping that he could use this soon, otherwise, it will be a big paperweight."
0,1,"She is only 3, but thrilled to have her own guitar after seeing the barbie diaries previews.  It's a neat product, works great, but the headpiece is too small to fit across the top of her head, not sure how it is suppose to stay on, but it doesn't stay on well. A lot of nice features for the price. mic works great too."
1,0,I bought this set primarily for the animal rummy card game which is identical to the one that I had as a child. It is really the best game of &#34;go fish&#34; around for me to play with my 4 year old daughter. I am pleased with the other decks as well but the animal rummy is defiantly my favorite. I also experienced excellent customer service from Think Fun because there was a defect in the Old Maid deck.  I contacted them via email and they sent out an entirely new deck immediately. I am very pleased!
0,1,"Kind of flimsy.  Not full decks IMO.  I think there are better games/value out there.  It was okay.  I just think there are better quality out there.  But for four games at a cheap price, I guess it's fine."
0,1,"Gave this to my eight-year old, who generally does these kind of things better than I do.  We're both stuck at #6.  He'll get past that point once he has time (homework, after-school activities and another puzzle http://www.amazon.com/Perplexus-Maze-Game-PlaSmart-Inc/dp/B002NPBT50/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1396461423&sr=1-1&keywords=puzzle+ball+maze occupy his free moments.)  Something that I can pack on a car trip or he can share when we do our next group camping trip."
0,1,"The ability to shift the maze around as you go sounded ""too good to be true"" for my 7 year old son, who LOVES mazes.  But he soon found out that shifting things doesn't just let you get past one spot, but changes other spots and can block what was open just a second ago.Makes for a far more challenging maze than just a static picture on a page.Wish it were larger and a little more complex, but for the price, was a good deal that he enjoys."
0,1,"Several of my daughter's friends have rocking horses and I love ours the most! The horizontal slats across the bottom provide the perfect platform for little ones to stand on. I have had this horse for almost a year now, and have had no problems with it. My daughter and her friends loves riding this rocking horse."
0,1,"I'm sure the picture depicts how big this is, but for some reason it is bigger than I'd expected!  It is also not completely plush--it has a wire or something to help it stand, I suppose. Also, the tail has the same wire or whatever inside the stuffing so it's more stiff than I would've liked. Pretty toy, though. Soft on the outside. Stands up just okay--falls over easily."
0,1,My 7 year old still loves this after a year of sleeping with it. His dinosaur helps to scare away any monsters that might want to scare him while he sleeps. lol.
0,1,"The 2 year old loves it.  The quality is great, stitching is really strong and overall the toy is sturdy.  One of those toys he'll still have for his own kids, which is rare.  He hugs it standing up, which is worth the price right there."
0,1,"OUR LITTLE GUY LOVES HIS T-REX!!  I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BIGGER - USED THE PIC TO MEASURE, BUT IT WAS SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN WE THOUGHT.  A BETTER PIC COULD REPRESENT THE CORRECT SIZE...EVEN THOUGH YOU DID POST THE MEASURMENTS, WE LOVED THE COMMERCIAL PIC!!"
1,0,Good concept but made cheapy. I gave this as a present to my niece for her 3rd birthday but she told me one of the locks was not working and that they were hard to put in. Also the picture was peeling off the house which I have seen with a lot of melissa anddoug products but i do love the idea of it and it's very cute
0,1,"only thing I really don't like is the strap really needs to be longer. I'm scared to cut it, fear of losing keys. Maybe I will get a large key chain to put on the keys so we won't lose it, and without the short strap it would be easier to use the keys in the locks."
0,1,love love love this. it is a little advanced for my 2 1/2 year old but she is still finding enjoyment out of it.
0,1,"My three-year old really enjoys this toy.  The doorbells are a big hit.  My one complaint is that the strap that attaches the strap to the handle is too short.  For little ones just figuring out keys, it creates and impossible angle to the keyhole.  That has discouraged my son from attempting the locks at all.  He does love playing with its other parts though.  Overall, the quality is a little lower than I expect from Melissa&Doug."
0,1,"Some of the blocks are pretty similar in shape, and it takes a fair bit of awareness and scrutiny to appreciate the difference, and therefore to get the sequences right. I got it for my 4 year old to help him with the concept of copying and following sequences, but he hasn't really got it yet."
0,1,"I had one of these as a kid but it wasn't as good.  This one is better because it has plastic protecting the springs so no little fingers get pinched.  I would not recommend anything like this for a child under 3 because it is kind of high off the ground, but this is a lot of fun for kids who are big enough for it."
0,1,"I bought this spring horse for my 2 & 1/2 year old because she loves horses and lets face it, who can afford a real one.  She loves it!  It's big for her but she can get on it herself, reach the top ""stirrups,"" and make it move.  It isn't like the spring horse I had when I was little, much tighter springs, and therfore safer I suppose.  She'll have to grow a bit to really get the thing going but it's a toy she can grow into instead of out of which means it will be useful for a long time.  Assembly required is an understatement.  I wish that the instructions would have indicated that the head and other important parts were nested inside the body cavity.  I thought I had been shipped an incomplete product (not fun right before Christmas) but got this information from the Radio Flyer website.  Given all that, the look on her face when she saw it was worth the hassle!"
0,1,Cute set that my son enjoys. Only set I found that a good mix of being for pretend and being able to use. They latern is the best. My sons uses it kind of like a flashlight all the time. I would defintely recommend this go go with a tent or camping themes items.
1,0,Both my daughters love playing teacher and enjoy using this set. It was larger than I expected but folds nice to put away when done.
0,1,"If your kids like to play school, this is perfect for them. I bought this a few years ago for my 4yr old daughter and she uses it very often. Now her younger sister uses it as well. It keeps them busy for hours."
0,1,My daughter loves this kit as does her younger brother.  They play school regularly and she thinks it is just perfect for her &#34;class&#34;.
0,1,"My 10 month old loves this phone. Before we bought this for her, we could not keep her away from our cell phones. We take this phone everywhere with us."
1,0,"I've heard many here harp about how the volume is too low.  That's not the problem, as the volume level is fine.  You don't want it too loud anyway, since this is a 'phone', and many children have a tendency to bring it close to their ears.  The main issue is that the audio is not CLEAR!  It sounds muffled.  Fisher-Price should use a better quality speaker so we can better hear the letters, numbers, and music.  Another concern of mine is the yellow 'smiley antenna' on the front top right of the unit.  It can eventually loosen up or break off, which can present a potentially deadly choking hazard!  So please monitor your little bugaboos if they have a tendency to chew on this toy as well.  I speak for myself, since our daughter is only 6 months old, and finds just as much interest in suckling on this phone as much as listening to it!  Otherwise, this is a very good product, with a very neat geometric display of 'dancing lights' and spatial patterns, which can help infants learn and build visual acuity."
1,0,"Baby could take it or leave it when she got it at 6 months. She's 10 months now and is bored with it. Kind of a frenetic little toy that doesn't do much beyond lighting up and flashing. Push buttons, get noise. A voice says ""1-2-3."" It isn't close enough to a real cell or house phone to encourage phone play; beyond the robot voice saying counting or saying abc's in threes, depending on which # you press, it's not much of an educational toy either. And the songs in the music mode are too short! Just a bar or two of melody. I'd skip this one."
0,1,My son loves this phone! He received it as a gift when he was 6 months - didn't really get much out of it besides chewing on it until he was closer to a year old. He is obsessed with phones so this is a great gift for him. I love the music setting - he really gets his groove on to some of those songs. The alphabet and numbers are a little annoying but educational. The only thing I don't like - it's so loud if you put it up to your ear. My son usually holds it on his shoulder.
0,1,"My son is now 13 months old and has enjoyed this phone for several months. He has always enjoyed the music and sounds. The volume is not loud, but I am glad. I can't stand those annoying phones that blare out the same things over and over. This one has a nice, audible sound with a nice variety of things it plays (letters, numbers, and music).My son does not like to travel in the dark when he's not sleepy, but this phone lights up and makes fun noises to keep him happy for quite a while even in the dark. I leave the phone in the car for him to play with, and he wants it every time we put him in his car seat. Definitely glad we bought it!!"
0,1,"My baby has played with this toy every day for six months straight, and she is 18 months old now and still playing with it. That speaks for itself I think. Someone else complained about a baby getting the shapes stuck in their mouth, which is a scary thought but I have not had that problem. I definitely think it is worth buying for any baby."
0,1,"We bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old son to keep him occupied during car trips and we couldn't be happier!! My husband initially balked at the purchase since it requires pvd's instead of dvd's, but even he's happy with this purchase.Once we showed our son the play button and the next button, he was off and running.  Any parent who has ever had to drag their kids with them on their errands knows how hard it is to occupy even the most cooperative toddler for more than a few minutes at a time.  With VideoNow Jr, I can take my son with me to the grocery store, doctor's appointments, the bank, and there's no arguing.  We can even get our son to sit through an entire meal at a restaurant now that he has VideoNow...If you buy the VideoNow Jr, I highly recommend investing in a set of rechargeable batteries.  Energizer makes a really nice unit that comes with a power cord for the car and one for the house for about $25 and charges the batteries in about 15 minutes.  If you use regular alkaline batteries for this toy, you will only get about eight hours of play time before the batteries die, so the $25 is definitely money well spent.My only complaint about this toy is that there are only a few titles available for toddlers, and those are hard to come by.  They seem to be sold out everywhere.  It's my husband's only ""I told you so"" moment..."
0,1,We got this for our 6 month old who is mobile already. He likes his other toys better and this one seems to startle him when is &#34;chases&#34; him.
0,1,We purchased this toy for my son when he was 2 months old. He is now 9 1/2 months old and still loves to play with it. The lady bug on top keeps him entertained because he can spin it around. He likes to pull the ball onto his lap when it starts moving around. It is a great toy!
0,1,Bought this a gift because I heard it was great. My 9 month old grandson wasn't too interested in it. I think it need to more lights to attract his attention.
1,0,"I like this toy, my one year old wasn't really interested in it but once in a while I'll catch her batting at it. It's nicely made and great quality. The songs and sounds are cute, and the fact that it moves itself is a nice feature."
1,0,"You can see from some of the consumer pictures that this ball has changed over the years. Not sure if it's the same other than appearance but ours is the one with the little ribbons sticking out of the top and the beetle attached to top in the middle, like some of the pictures. At first my daughter just cried and pounded her fists when this ball would roll around and away from her. She wanted to play with it and was pretty mad that she couldn't. Once she started crawling, she had a lot of fun with this ball. I don't think the ball encouraged her to crawl but once she started, she definitely wanted to follow this ball around. It's not educational b/c it's movements are random as are the noises but she did have a lot of fun with it. I speak in past tense because a couple weeks after she actual started playing the ball, it broke. It still lights up and plays music but it doesn't roll around anymore. Disappointed.Edit: I guess our ball isn't broken. I wanted to be sure before we threw it out, so I replaced the batteries and it works like new. So weird that the movement goes before the sound and lights, rather the whole unit just failing when the batteries die. Well, now we know. Glad it works!"
0,1,This neat little ball has all sorts of things to keep a baby's attention.  It was purchased as a 1st birthday present and went over well.
0,1,Not sure this Activity Ball from Vtech was worth the price but as least was animated and rolled around making noise to catch the attention of the little one.
0,1,"I like the fact that this toy doesn't run away from the baby, but moves in a circle so that it is actually able to be caught by the baby. The buttons on it are very cute, and very sensative. This makes them easy for the baby to push, but this means that it is also easy for the baby to push the wrong button when playing a game. There is a volume button which is always great, and there is an on/off switch, which too is great. What I don't like is that the toy instructions state that you are not to use rechargable batteries. I wonder why?"
0,1,"We got this to help our son learn to crawl. It makes sense to learn to crawl on something soft, like carpet, but this ball doesn't roll or move well on carpet. In addition it was very annoying. In general, our son did not enjoy it much at all. I would not recommend it."
0,1,"I disagree with most of the posts complaining that this is a rude toy.  Like someone else said, does your 6 month old really know what they are saying?  If they are like me, I don't even really listen to it.  I will agree that it's very hard to understand how to ""get"" everything out of the toy that you can, meaning the different songs, the abc's.  I've heard it a few times say ""a"" is for apple, and so on.  Once even heard for ""P"" and ""T"", but nothing else.  There are no instructions either on how to make it go through the whole alphabet.I just don't like the fact that there are probably more features to it than you realize but you keep hearing all the same phrases....""outta the way"" ""slow down little fella""  I don't think at all that the phrase ""I'm outta gas."" makes it sound in any way that it's someone's else's fault. It's harmless.  I just felt the need to let people know, it's not the greatest of toys, but also I wouldn't dismiss it because of the phrases on it.  My son likes it, although he loses interest in it, like he does with most everything else.  But for a few minutes he likes it."
1,0,"This toy is soooo loud and annoying, but kids just love it!My son loved playing with his when he was little, so I ordered one for my niece for Christmas... Her mom was pleased with it when it arrived... We'll see how much she likes it after the kid gets to play with it on Christmas, he he he (&#60;- evil laugh)It really is a great toy though, it kept my son and his friends entertained for long periods of time. It may be annoying, but as a parent it's beneficial to learn how to tune out the noises of annoying toys anyways."
0,1,Got this gor Christmas for my then one year old. He loves the sounds and music.  It'll be a good learning tool when he gets older.
1,0,"I'm usually a fan of Vtech - and when a friend got this toy for her 6 month old, I was interested in it.  We bought it for my 6 month old son for Christmas and he was excited to play with it for 30 minutes or so - and now it just takes up space in the toy box.  He barely plays it and rarely seems interested. It's not even that educational - and it constantly seems to be going off while it's just resting in the toybox. I'd save your money and buy something more educational that would keep your baby's attention for more than a day."
0,1,"This is definitely a good toy to buy that really keeps my boys' attention. They love the balls and the keyboard and go back to this toy again and again. I only have a few complaints about it (why it only got 3 stars). First of all, the music is really loud even on the low volume setting (my boys have also figured out how to make it go to the high volume setting, which is very loud). I am not usually one to complain about volume, but this one seems louder than many of their other toys. I don't like the music, but my boys do, which is the important thing. The ball storage is a nice feature since I have soooo many balls from the different toys that they have, but the door to the storage area is not real tight and opens when I pick up the toy to put it away, sending the balls wherever. Each ball is supposed to change the function on the toy to music, numbers, colors, shapes, etc, but I have noticed that after a lot of play the toy doesn't always respond correctly (the music ball sometimes changes the setting to numbers, etc). My boys don't mind and it is still educational despite that. My only other complaint about this toy is that the stickers on it have not held up at all. My boys have had this toy for about 6 months and two of the stickers have worn away. Granted, they play with this toy all of the time and it gets abused by two boys, but most of their other toys' stickers have stayed in good condition, even toys that they have had longer or that were handed down to them. It is engaging and will keep their attention, so I do recommend it if none of the complaints are an issue for you."
0,1,"I bought this Helmet not too long ago, and it was great looking in it's box. It took a while to get it out, and had to adjust it to my head to try it out. The pre-recorded voice came out nicely. It is the voice changer that I had trouble with. The voice changer has three level button on it, and I tried all of'em. None realy worked. I mean it, not a single one of them even came close. At times as I have read in other reviews I had to shout just to hear the outcome, which you could probably tell that it would have sounded bad. I tried to wisper my breathing and I got close to the original breathing voice of Vader. I am a big fan of Star Wars, but this is pretty disappointing."
0,1,"Finally a game to make use of all my knowlege derived from years of reading gossip magazines and news stories!  Some of the questions are pretty hard, but if they were easy, it would be boring.  The container is pretty cool looking too."
0,1,"It's actually a fun game, but the way you move around the board in this version is kind of non-sensical and takes the fun out of it.  We ended up &#34;inventing&#34; our own way to play and just ignored the board.  I've seen other versions that had a better set up and I will keep an eye out for them."
0,1,"At just the right height for little ones, this Laugh and Learn table is perfect for tots who have learned to stand up; take the legs off and your baby can enjoy it too.  With lots of colorful and cute make believe foods like pizza, a cookie and a fruit bowl, your child can learn A-B-C's, colors, shapes, 123's, along with interesting textures and adorable (non-annoying to adults) music!  The flashing lights are not blinding like on some other toys, which is a big plus.We received this as a gift when our daughter was two and she and her little sister have gotten hours of enjoyment from it.  A good investment, though I think the price could come down just a bit to be completely worth it.The two level volume control comes in handy too. The floating alphabet soup is just adorable, and your little one can pretend they're eating with the red smiley face spoon, just keep an eye on that piece since it tends to fall off easily and disappear.Recommended for 6 months to three years, but I think best age to really learn and appreciate the toy is between 18-30 months."
0,1,"I bought this toy for my son for Christmas when he was just 7 months old and he loved it from day one.  There are plenty activities for little hands. The music and lights delighted my son.  He loved to pull himself up and stand like and big boy and play with his table long before he could stand on his own. He is now 16 months old and still loves this toy, he plays with it almost everyday.  It seems to me that he will not be growing tired of this toy anytime soon."
1,0,"This table (and another we have) was a great buy for so many reasons.  First,  the music setting includes a wide variety of tunes from a latin beat to country-folksy,  and it NEVER gets old watching a baby dance.  You have got to hear the song played when the bowl is turned - hilarious! The legs come off for babies that cannot stand or pull up yet.  It is sturdy and colorful with a variety of textures and activities.  Infants practice balance leaning against the table and learn to walk by holding onto it and walking around to touch the other side. My son said his second word ever;  By turning the apple, the table says ""red apple"" and my son repeated ""apple.""  I couldn't believe my ears.  I highly recommend buying this table and a few others if your budget allows.  Babies seem to really like them."
0,1,"They stick to the tub wall just like they claim, they are durable because they have survived occas. chewing (though I try to prevent it).  No mildew noted after months of use."
1,0,"Got these for my 15 month old for christmas.  He loves them!  He gets a little frustrated sometimes because he sometimes tries to get the front part to stick (and it won't...it's grooved...the back is smooth), but he'll get the hang of it.  He loves to help me put them all up and then we knock them all back into the water.  Also makes a great teether.  I can think of other things I'd rather he chew on, but in the tub, he loves to bite these (he's getting a front tooth and four molars...can't say I blame him).When you first open the container, the foam smell is a bit overwhelming.  I soaked them in the tub after one of his baths overnight and let them air out for a day or two and the smell has all but gone away.I teach Kindergarten so I look forward to using these to teach him his letters...I do wish they had a set of lowercase as well instead of two uppercases.  Also, some of the letters (M and W namely), you have to use your imagination to call it what it is...so I wouldn't rely on these soley for teaching letters."
0,1,We bought one of these jump rocket sets a few years ago and my kids still play with it.  They are 9 years old now.  We purchased another one recently to give as a gift to my nephews and have given them as birthday gifts in the past.  It's a very neat toy for all ages and it gets everyone outside away from tv and video games.  Me and my husband have both jumped on the jump rocket and it works just fine with our weight (&#62;200lbs)
0,1,"It's great fun for the kiddies!  They love to see it soar in the air.  Gets a minus on a star for the legs....mine got warped from being in the car...it's my fault but the legs should be sturdy plastic, not foam!"
1,0,"recently i was cleaning out my room and i re-discovered this doll, that i got for Christmas in 2004. She is still the most gorgeous doll i have ever owned. The hair is amazing. Golden with pink braids. The clothes are cute and different. She is very durable. I definetly recomend getting this Bratz doll. She is definetly worth buying.."
0,1,Bought this to add to my collection and was well worth the extra postage for international shipping!.Not much else I can says except it's a lovely doll with very well made clothes and accessories!
0,1,"My son received this when he was 3.5, and it's perfect for his age.  Some of the jumping moves are a challange for him, but it's good practice in retrying, and patience.  The graphics are a little coarse, especially on a bigger TV, but I doubt he notices or cares.  He's still playing this after 6 months."
1,0,"If your four year old child doesn't know his or her alphabet or shapes then maybe this smartridge could teach them something (assuming they have good hand/eye coordination), otherwise it's just entertainment.Three Stars.  'Safe' proto-XBOX entertainment.  Educational value: low.  Even my 3 year-old son wasn't challenged."
0,1,"Alot of these v smile games have really crappy graphics, this one's not the best. Out of all the games in this age range, it's not one of her favorites but she does like it and play it regularly. I purchased the v smile for her for Christmas along with about 7 games. My only mistake was to give them all to her at once. As with any 4 year old, who is having their first game system experience, she would play a game for a minute or two and then get discouraged and put in another. I had to take them all away and let her choose one game to play per day. Whichever game she chose for that day was the only one she got no matter how hard she found it. That did the trick, she learned how to play all of them in this manner and now I let her choose as she pleases. These are great games for the age group, like I said this one is good for beginners, she's had it for about 6 months but i'm not sure if she will continue to be interested in it."
0,1,"My (almost) 4 year old son, loves this game. It is a more challenging for him, unlike the Winnie-the-Pooh game, which he figured out pretty easily.This game has great games for 2 players. He plays it for hours with his friends."
1,0,"My wife and I bought this for our oldest daughter for Christmas.  She's four and loved the movie upon which this game is based.  Although it isn't her favorite v-smile game, she quite enjoyed it nonetheless.  As parents, my wife and I found this game a little more challenging for our daughter in terms of its education value.Probably the most educational game is in the market where Ariana must find different items on a shopping list and then count the number of each particular item needed.  There are a number of other great games that involve counting and expanding a child's vocabulary.  These are probably the two educational strengths of this particular game, as a child the age towards which this game is intended (4 to 6 years) is probably already familiar with matching and colors -- the other two strengths of this game."
0,1,"My daughter absolutely loves this game.  It is more challenging than some of the other, but not too hard for a 4 year old.  This game is not as educational as some of the others, but is great for math/counting skills.  If your daughter loves Aerial ahe will love dressing her up in hats, and jewelery, and love helping her shop in the market for different fruits an vegetables.  I think this one is great,"
0,1,"Unfortunately, as much as I hate to give negative reviews; I am going to have to rate this not very high. This used to be lots of fun. However, the latest one that I have ordered is not holding up very well. The middle pole pops out and it seems very flimsy.I glanced over the other reviews and it appears that others are not having the same problems? Maybe we simply got a poorly put together set?The concept is good. We really liked this when we had it previously. However, this one seems flimsy and could be better built."
0,1,"This was a breeze to set up, and my daughter loves to play with it.  It takes a while for the kids to get the hang of knocking the ball back and forth.  She is on the smaller side, 43 pounds and 43 inches, and this is the perfect size for her.  For bigger kids or adults, I would suggest a larger set."
0,1,When I bought this it was only $34. Now I want to buy another one but the price is $62. I would never spend that much on this item!! It is really fun to play and wanted to take one camping with us but only if it gets down to $34 again. Definitely not worth paying twice the price!! Really disappointing!!
1,0,"Realistic and sturdy.  I bought this for my 3 year old.  He can be rough but this toy stands up to him.  He plays with it often.  If you're thinking about getting this, I'd say go for it!"
0,1,"This is great to have to add to young boys construction toys and use it properly,  and exciting, fun to play with."
0,1,When this set arrived I emptied the tools out and made sure none had sharp edges and that was ok.  but after  putting them in the canvas bag it looked half.  We went out to our local garden store and added things to it to fill it up.  Not enough in it to give for a gift'
0,1,"My 18-month-old daughter uses this set to &#34;help&#34; her grandma garden She loves it, especially the tote. The tools are very sturdy and a good size for small hands."
0,1,"Even tho this says for age 3 and up, I see nothing dangerous about this, and there are no small parts a toddler could put in his mouth.  The edges of the tools are smooth and not sharp.  My 2 grandsons love this, and love helping Mommy in the garden with their own tools.  The tote bag is nice too to carry things they find in the dirt - like sticks and stones!"
0,1,"Stays on, multiple uses so far and it wipes right off with a simple baby wipe.  No hard rubbing.  Used this for Halloween...for simple dress up stuff (we bought an extra book of ideas to have more fun) and even used this for Christmas for Santa's helper.  Don't think I'll be throwing it out or packing it away like we usually do with the Halloween makeup we buy in the store each year.  Seems like it will last a while.  I just put the whole thing in a freezer bag and zipped close to keep it fresh."
0,1,"This is an excellent face painting kit.  You get a variety of colors and a good amount of the colors.  Face painting can be a fun activity for parties and it can just come in handy for Halloween, plays, or whatever other event where you need a fun face design.  The paint also comes off easily (I've had some that leave residue so you end up with a slight tint for a couple days)."
1,0,I bought this for a friend to do face painting at a my kiddies birthday party. It is the best set!It seems so easy to put on but even better easy to take off. Good price here too.
0,1,"My granddaughter loves to get her face painted and has long wanted to try it.  This was the best starter project that I could have purchased.  The paints are water based and easily removed if you make a mistake.  After drying they remain on for a long time but will still be easily removed with water.  It came with everything a child needs to try their hand at face painting.  The project book was great.  The pictures were clear and instructions were understandable, even for a 9 year old.  She did every face in the book, sometimes twice! Hours of fun for everyone. I will be ordering from this seller again.  This is a great summer fun purchase. Everything washes off and if clothing gets messy it too comes clean with a little water. Parents, give your child a chance to be a face painter. They will love it!"
0,1,"super easy to use, goes on very smooth. My favorite part is it stays all day (if they don't go rubbing it!) but with a baby wipe it cleans off super super easy.  I was even able to use the brushes that came with it fairly well. (yes tinier brushes would help, but not needed.) I have never face painted anything above a school paw print before but I got this kit for my son just for fun, and so far I have painted a dragon, a rainbow, a full face butterfly, and a full face tiger and the paint doesnt even look dented. It was easy enough that I could do it on a 4 and 5 yr old in very little time.  I like the fact that even though my lines may not be perfect the paint is easy to work with and get it to look great.  I hope to get a bigger set maybe with screw on lids...that is the only complaint I have (but for the cost I knew what I was getting) is that you have to place tiny plastic saran wrap circles over the paint (that it comes with) to help prevent drying out--it hasn't shown any signs of it drying out but I wouldn't want to leave off the plastic and it means you can't throw away the box as that's what it is stored in.  I know it was designed more for the one time ""party"" use so I didn't dock it in my rating.  I was really really surprised with the quality of this paint for the cost."
0,1,"I got this for my daughter's bday party-all the girls loves it! it has directions how to do it, which is very simple (you probably just need a little bit of artsy hands...).I will try to post a picture of the results, but it was really great!Also, I liked how easily it came off with water... not like some other face painting that you need to scrub hard..."
1,0,"Ok, I hate my scene and I'm here to tell you why. Well, for millions of reasons!!! Here are 10:1.They are ugly2.They copied diva stars and bratz3.They are BORING!!!!4.They are stoopid5.They are REALLY ugly6.No one likes them7.All they talk abot is FASHION, FASHION and FASHION8.Bratz are better than them9.Even my scene guys are ugly10.I HATE THEM!!!!#1 MY SCENE HATER!!!!!!!"
0,1,"The My Scene dolls are such posers! They're nothing but wanna'be Bratz (and need I remind you that the Bratz are way cooler!) This Masquerade Madness doll is a copy of the Funk n' Glow Bratz and she doesn't even look half as pretty. Why can't Mattel just except the fact that ""Barbie's Pink Reign of Idiotic Terror"" is OVER. GIVE UP MATTEL MY SCENE HAS NOTHING ON THE BRATZ DOLLS!~From: Kazami Ami a BRATZ fan"
0,1,"You say somebody is bad because they like my scene. I don't really like my scene that much it's just that I like them better than bratz. And to that girl who says I am a my scene slave, you write cruel and hurtful things. You almost made me consider suicide, they were that mean. You act like you want to kill every single my scene fan. Please, Amazon is a place for opinions, not insults."
0,1,"Horrible, horrible hair!  If you think you have had a bad hair day before - wait til you see this head!  LOL  Not worth the money.  We took ours to Goodwill (probably should have just put it in the trash.)  It was nothing like the one I had as a child.  Not worth the money!"
0,1,1st pull the pieces of hair that are course OUT of her head.Then you will have more fun her facial make-up changes color with warm water and ice.I love her hair color. She is the best Barbie styling head ever made thats a fact.
0,1,"this is totally a cute black cat - I got it for me but then had to order 2 more for each of my children since they wanted to keep it.  It is soft and green eyes that seem to glow when the light hits them just right.  Cat is great to sit on your shoulder, back of the couch or just anywhere you want it to be.  I totally would buy this over and over for any cat lover.  totally worth it"
0,1,"My Scene - Shopping Spree - Madison is such a gorgeous doll! I got her about two months ago, and she has been my favorite My Scene doll ever scince. Her hair is light, fluffy, and curly, and she comes with many FAB shoes and boots! This is a wonderful doll, and guess how much i payed for her? $10 on sale @ this gift shop! If you want a great shopping Spree:My Scene doll, than i would so get Madison! I have Chelsea, too, but she is kind of a 'let down'.`~ Read my other reviews!!"
0,1,We got these for our daughter to go along with her step2 play kitchen (not knowing they already came with the kitchen anyway) so now we have 2 sets and our daughter plays with them almost everyday
0,1,My 19 month old granddaughter loves playing with the pots and pans.  They are very durable and just enough pieces for plenty of pretend playing.  I know she will be entertaining with this set for a long time.  Happy Grandma !
0,1,"My 2 1/2 year old son received this as a Christmas present.  I wasn't going to get it out of the box until he was closer to 3 years old, but a friend convinced me to break it out now.  Am I glad I did!  My son loves it!  We didn't have any of the set-up problems mentioned in other reviews, and our controller works just fine.  Like another reviewer, we do not have to have the controller directly in line with the DVD player in order for it to receive the signal.  The full time for set-up was less than 20 minutes.My son loves Elmo and is familiar with the Elmo's World videos.  The DVD that comes with the system is great for him to watch and play with. He understands Elmo's questions and can find the corresponding shapes on the controller.I highly recommend this product, and am glad he received it.  We will get hours of entertainment, not to mention education, out of it."
0,1,"We bought this toy for our daughter for Christmas and we were disappointed to discover that it isn't compatible with either of our dvd players.  Our daughter was so disappointed because she wanted to watch and play the dora dvd!  I highly recommend you make sure your dvd player is compatible before purchasing this toy - even though I'm not sure if it will do any good.  We have a Marantz dvd player, and it is apparently compatible with this, yet we couldn't get it to work.  I've read several reviews where children were disappointed because they couldn't play with this toy; I recommend setting this up to ensure it works before letting the kids see it!"
0,1,"My daughter is not yet in the recommended age group for this toy (she is only 8 months), but she still loves it!  I found ours on clearance at Target for $19; if it had been full price I probably would not have purchased it.  Ryan loves to watch the street spin.  We put lots of stuff on the road to watch it spin around.  She loves grabbing at all of it.  I love the orchestra.  We like to play all three of them at the same time.  They actually sound good together!  I know when she gets older she will be able to do more imaginative play with the toy, but for now we like to make the street spin.  I only wish that it spun for a longer period of time, but that would be my only complaint.  I like that it comes with so many accessories.  It gives Ryan a lot of stuff to chew on!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  I ended up buying a second one for her cousin!"
0,1,"This is just a grand toy. I have not seen anything else that comes close! It does everything! My daughter's attention was kept for and entire hour without interruption while she played and explored all the countless things it does. I purchased it when she was 7 months old. Now at 10 months, she enjoyes it even more as her motor skills sharpen and she begins to understand how everything functions. It is so exciting for her to press the door bell or open the mail I left for her from the other side and dance everytime a song comes plays (which are just the cutest songs!). Love this toy. Every one should have one!  Ok, I have had a problem tho, it was with the numbers on the top of the ""outside"" of the house, the number 8 would always chime ""number 9"" incorrectly. The manual says that this may happen if the batteries are dying but this happened shortly after putting it together. It corrected itself and was fine for a while but recently began again. It so far has only happened with the number 8 and nothing else."
0,1,There's not much new I can say with 500+ other five-star reviews. Our daughter has loved playing with this since she was about six months old - she's now eleven months - and even three and four year olds who come to visit love to play with it. Lots of activities; you'll get a ton of use out of it!
0,1,"My son received this toy for Christmas from his grandparents and I am amazed at how much he is learning as the months go by. He recently turned one and is now able to match some of the shapes in the shape sorter and loves opening the window and door. The house has 2 modes of learning, one musical and one the teaches opposites. (on/off, open/close, up/down, morning/night..etc.) He also uses the house to pull up on and it has withheld his weight well (21lbs) although I'm not sure that will be the case much sooner as he's getting bigger. Space wise, the house doesn't take up too much of it and can be easily moved around to suit everyone's needs. The toy also has an on/off switch and 2 levels of volume. Definately will get your money's worth with this one."
0,1,"I purchased this for my grandson when he was just starting to crawl. He'll be three years old next month and he still loves it. The way he plays with it has changed as he's aged. This toy is very attractive and has so many different things to do, along with a choice of voice or sounds. It's sturdy and looks exactly as it did when it was new.  I haven't had to change the batteries in the 2 1/2 years I've had it, probably because my grandson is here only 24 hours a week. This is the most versatile toy I've purchased and the one that has held my grandson's interest the longest.  It's a must-have!"
0,1,"WOW!!!5 stars and a round of applause for the Laugh & Learn Home!  If it hasn't already, it deserves to win an award.This toy is too cute.  I can't believe the number of sounds it makes!  Between the 2 different functions (learning and music) there must be 100 different noises, phrases and music.  From the downspout that counts the balls or plays Itsy Bitsy Spider as you drop them in, to the front door that creaks or says ""Open/Shut, Hello/Goodbye when you open and close it, to the outdoor light and doorbell, to the radio!  Each item plays several different noises/music and they change depending on which mode you have it on.  It would take me an hour to describe all of them.Assembly was a snap.  My husband had it together in 15 minutes.  And the construction is great - very durable!This is the best toy I've seen (or bought) for a long time!!!!  You can't lose with this one!  It's money well-spent!!!"
1,0,"This toy is absolutely the best toy we own (and we have a lot!!!) Our 11 month old got this for Christmas at 6 months old, and still plays with it EVERY day, for hours! There are so many different activities and sounds. It is great to play with together or alone. At first I thought the shape sorter was the worst feature, because it is one of the few features that doesn't make the toy make noise--BUT, my son loves those shapes and works hard all the time to get them back in. The sounds aren't obnoxious like other toys, and they cycle through a few sounds for each feature.The only thing I would change is to make it a bit less wobbly to pull up on. While it doesn't ever seem in danger of tipping, it really wobbles when he pulls up and cruises it. I think the baby kind of likes that though. He is also very big for 11 months (97% for both height and weight) so that may make it wobble more for us.Overall I would say BUY THIS!!! It really is great (the play wall doesn't even come close). The birdbath is great too!"
0,1,"The reviews do not lie: This is a GREAT toy! The volume is not too loud or too low, it's easy to put together (but good to have someone to help with all the screws), and lots of fun for little ones. Got this for my 9 month old daughter and she and my 21 month old love it!"
0,1,"I won't bother repeating all the details from other reviews but I can tell you this : My daughter is now three, has had this for two years, and STILL plays with it."
0,1,"We bought this used when my son was 9 months old.  At first, he played with it everyday.  He's now 2.5 and still plays with it at least a few times each month.  I keep thinking it won't interest him anymore, so I put it in the corner of a walk-in closet.  I think that has only made it more fun for him.  He will crawl behind the door to hide and play at the same time.  I can't think of another toy we own that has entertained him that long.  I think that says a lot about a toy."
0,1,"My 11-month old loves this toy - we got it for her when she was about 10 months and she still enjoys playing with it several times through-out the day.  While she doesn't much pay attention to the learning songs that play she does love to open and close the door and mailbox, and ring the doorbell and turn the light switch on and off.  I'm hoping as she gets older she'll discover and play with some of the other features like the numbers and clock, the balls that drop down the side and the shape-sorter that's built into the door."
0,1,"While I find the voices of the Fisher Price toys annoying, my daughter loves them.  My daughter is 10 months, and we have had this now for about 2 months.  While it says 1 year and up, it depends on your baby.  I think it is perfect for those just starting to walk.  At 8 months, she would hold on and walk around the house.  Then she started letting go.  I really think it helps them to walk because there is so much to do on both sides that they want to get to it and end up letting go because of that.I have several items from the Laugh and Learn line (I have this, the barn door, and both kitchens - the one they can crawl through the center and the sit down one).  While these items are a little pricier than some other toys she has right now, I feel like she will at least get more time out of these then she did other things that cost this much.  Spent a fortune on things like a jumparoo, an exesaucer, craddle swing, etc. She was over the swing at 4.5 months (she would try to sit up in the swing and then it would be off balance and I would get worried), the jumparoo and exesaucer were great until she started to walk really good (around 9 months -- since she didn't start going in them until close to 4 months, really we only got 5 months of use out of them).  Since all these items were more expensive than this play house, I feel like it isn't over priced.Love that you can buy a replacement accessory kit as well since I know she will end up loosing some of the shapes, etc."
0,1,I bought this toy for my two year old daughter and one year old son when it first came out. That was a few months ago and they still play with it everyday. Their favorite thing to do is to go in and out through the door and to say hi to eachother through the window. I love this toy!!!
0,1,"I purchased this along with several other laugh and learn products for my baby's first birthday. I have to say that they are all great toys, much better quality than Fisher-Price has shown in recent years. She is now 18 months old and is still in love with it. She spends the whole day crawling all over it, trying to climb on it, she has found all the buttons and all in all really is kept busy by it all day. This is the best activity toy I have found so far. Worth every penny!!!!!"
0,1,Our son loves this learning home. It teaches him so much and he just loves the music. I'm so glad we bought it for him. It keeps him entertained for hours. Definetly a must have toy!!
1,0,"My son loves his geotrax.  Seems like you never have enough track.  Oh well.  Clock tower strikes 2 and my 4 year old says ""mommy, its 2 o'clock!""Must have for geotrax...where else are you going to go but up??"
0,1,"This is a great add-on to your geotrax system.  Three levels of fun.  The top two levels include music and sounds.  I will say, the music could be a little louder.  With the motorized train running it tends to be hard to hear.  You definitely will need to buy at least one, probably two, elevation packs to fully utilize the top two levels.  It is, hands down, my son's favorite part of his train set."
0,1,"I was disappointed in this toy at first because it didn't sing any of the songs all the way through.  I mean, who wants an alphabet song that stops at P?  My husband ended up figuring out how to turn it off demo, and now it does the whole songs, which is great and saves the toy from getting donated somewhere.  It is now a great toy.  It's so cute, fun, and also educational.  My daughter loves to hug it to hear it talk and also to hear all the songs.  This toy is now a favorite in our house."
0,1,"This toy has a great concept:  learn colors and body parts (hand, foot, mouth, ear, etc.) accompanied by familiar children's songs.  I like it.  But for my 12 month old daughter it isn't interesting enough to hold her attention for more than a minute.  My 3 y.o. likes to hear the songs, but she already knows her colors and body parts.  She'll listen to it for a few minutes longer, then it just goes back in the box with the stuffed animals.There is one thing that is rather annoying, there's no internal on/off button.  So the puppy can't be held purely as a stuffed animal (ie, at night when the child is sleeping), because, if your child touches the button on the foot it is easily turned back on.  It's unfortunate that the kids don't like this toy better, maybe it would be good for a road trip or something."
0,1,"I bought this for my 29 month old grandson. At first he did not play with it much.  Now he likes to play, sing, and dance to the songs.  This dog is cute, but it's loud.  There should have been a volume control on the dog.  After listening to the singing for a while, I got concerned about the volume affecting my grandchildren and my ears.If I try to put it up, sometimes my grandson wants to still play with it and will get upset.  I try and do this to give us a break from the loud volume.  So of course, I tend to give in and let him play for a little while longer.  His baby sister likes it also, and both have their favorite songs.  This is my only complaint about the dog, which is why I gave it a 3 star."
1,0,"I bought this for my 10 month old. It is bigger than the picture looks. It is very soft and cuddly. The buttons are very sensitive, which makes it easy or your little one to operate. The heart on the dog's chest lights up, which catches my baby's attention. Very educational and perfect for your boy or girl. I recommend this to all parents."
0,1,"My daughter loves this since she was only 4 months, she's a year old now, I can say this is one of her favorite toy. She prefers playing with this than Baby Tad because it is a lot lighter and more huggable :)"
0,1,"My daughter and I are in love with this toy!I was SO lucky recently to find this toy in a thrift shop for FIFTY CENTS in perfect condition! However, knowing now how much my one-year-old loves it I would pay double the list price to get it!Some people complain about how easily the buttons activate but I think that is a major plus because babies have trouble pressing less sensitive buttons. I know my daughter has similar toys that she still has trouble activating.There are buttons all over the toy's body, they have many different responses and tons of songs. My little girl carries him around by his ears and dances to his songs. I'm even falling a little in love with him when he says sweet things like ""I love you,"" ""You're my friend,"" ""Hug me!""My 17-month-old nephew got this when he was 5 months old and my brother says he basically ignores it because he's had it so long. Maybe he'll take a renewed interest in it, I dunno. This is toy is now my one-year-old's best friend and I don't see her losing interest anytime soon."
1,0,"The dog itself is great. However, it tends to &#34;talk&#34; on its own. It's creepy and annoying. I'm not a fan."
0,1,"Yes, this puppy is adorable. Such bright colors and great learning toy for the little one. My little grandson adores it."
0,1,"She received the puppy for Christmas this past year, and while it took her a few days to really sit down and play with it (thanks to getting WAAAY too many gifts!), she now *loves* the puppy.  She asks to take it in the car, no matter if we're driving several hours to visit family, or driving a few minutes to run errands.She already knew a lot of the basics the puppy teaches, but she still has lots of fun playing and dancing and singing as the puppy sings.  She's working on her A-B-C's thanks to the puppy's A-B-C song.However, while we didn't have problems with the ear, we had problems with one of the puppy's paws!  Perhaps there is a slight technical glitch with the wiring or set-up of the buttons...hopefully Fisher-Price will get this figured out.Regardless, this puppy is super cute and provides lots of educational fun."
0,1,"We got this toy for my daughter when she was about 6 months old. It is a favorite, and perfect for when they are traveling. It has many different features: songs (""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"" and ""Do Your Ears Hang Low"") and many games (Pat-a-cake, Pat-a-cake Baker's Man"" and ""This Little Piggy"") She loves this dog and I am glad I bought this one and not the LeapFrog Learning Lily, because her cousin has one and she did not really care for it. The only bad thing I can see about this dog is that the bone is supposed to light up when he sings and stuff, and the bone does not light up anymore, and that was one of the eye catchers to her."
0,1,"In just a few days this has turned into my sons fav toy. At 6 months its just cute to see him become so attached to something. He has a blanket that he uses, but doesnt need it with him all the time. He only gets a nuk at bed time, so this is his first security thing i think. We bought this for our son and daughter, for what we thought would be a learning toy. That we would just put in the toy box at the end of the day. But now its Bryants puppy. Since he started to crawl he holds onto the puppys ears and crawls along with him its so cute :) We also found that when hes tired he loves to rub the puppy's ear agaisnt his face and it helps him fall alseep. He actualy hasnt used his nuk in 4 whole days now!Besides being just so cute and soft this puppy is a great learning tool. There is just so much to do on this little guy! Abc's counting, music, lights and the names of body parts. At night or at nap times we have just been turing the switch off so the puppy doesnt start up while our little guy is sleeping.Our daughter also enjoys the puppy. When she can get her hands on him she likes pushing his little bottons and hearing what he has to say. Or likes hear the music. All around i think Bry gives this puppy 5 stars so does mommy and daddy!"
0,1,"I'm not really thrilled about this toy.  Although I had fun with it, my daughter hardly plays with it at all.  Generally speaking, it was a waste of money for us.  I definitely wouldn't spend 59.99 for it, that's for sure."
1,0,"Five Stars for Fun: I bought the Fisher-Price: Laugh and Learn Puppy for my grand daughter for Christmas. At 14 months it was the perfect gift. Molly drags it from room to room, sleeps with it and wakes up playing with it. I am sure this plush pup will be with her for several years to come.Five Stars for Educational Value: Press to hear: Ear, Foot, Hand and Tummy. It also plays several sing along tunes and has a number of phrases. The voice used in the mechanism is crystal clear - something that is not often true in many of today's toys.Five Stars for Durability: The Laugh & Learn Puppy is very well made and I am sure it will not only last through her young years but will be passed on to other grand children in the future."
0,1,Love this puppy. Get it every year for a new baby. They love it and it is the perfect size.
0,1,"My daughter loves this puppy! She received this as a Christmas gift last year and it goes practically everywhere with her. The buttons are easily triggered, giving her a response every time she touches it. She enjoys the songs and interaction and dances to the music. The down side is that the silly thing goes off at the oddest times, like late at night when the cat mistakenly jumps on it. The songs get a little annoying after a while, but it is difficult to find a toy where that ISN'T the case. All in all, she loves it, has learned from it, and we will continue to tolerate the annoying songs for her sake."
1,0,"My son has loved this puppy since he was only a few weeks old (he is now 9 months).  He loves the singing...it always puts a smile on his face, and he loves squeezing the different parts to make sounds (loves the cause/effect).  The only thing is the ear doesn't work anymore.  But, I think it's because the little one chewed on it too much and broke it. Anyway, it's still a great toy and he's had so much fun with it!"
1,0,"Our family loves playing games, but no one was looking forward to playing Candyland over-and-over again when our grandson was ready to play games. ""Monkeying Around"" seemed as if it might be an excellent alternative.  The adults in our family who play games and, most importantly, the little ones think ""Monkeying Around"" is a winner. It is sturdy, colorful, and delights our grandson when the monkeys topple the tree. The game is challenging enough for adults - determining balance and distribution of the monkeys - so that they are not adverse to playing this game with the little ones in your household.""Monkeying Around"" seems to be durable and able to take enthusiastic toddler play. The monkeys are plastic and will not break; we keep them in a Ziploc sandwich bag ton prevent losing them. If the game structure is dropped, the tree trunk which is made of hard plastic could possibly break, so we do put the assembled tree out of reach when not in use. The spinner is probably the weakest aspect of ""Monkeying Around"" - it does not spin particularly easily. A better option would have been an arrow-shaped spinner attached to a cardboard square with the numbers and large monkey printed in the different segments.Players will learn to make decisions when each must decide where monkeys should be hung.  Little ones learn there are consequences for choosing to incorrectly place the monkey. Further, the game teaches a child to think about balance and weight distribution when deciding where the monkeys are to be hung.""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way to introduce games to a child. The recommended age range of 4 and up is probably appropriate; at 3, a toddler may not fully understand taking turns.  However, ""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way for a child to begin understanding that concept."
0,1,"I'm told it's great because the 3yo can play with family or play alone. Having a 3yo myself, I can see the appeal in that."
1,0,"I bought this for my granddaughter after seeing another child play with it...she adores it. The tunes, etc are not the typically annoying ones like most musical toys, and even at 4 months, she was having a blast.  It is now my go to gift as part of a package for baby gifts, and , so far, everyone has raved about it."
1,0,I cant say anything bad but my 20months has no interst in it at all!
0,1,Klaus Teuber is a genius making up this game.  The original game is  so much fun.  BUT for this particular version - Pieces are way too small.  If they had made the pieces just a little bigger it would be much better.  I bought this for kids in a daycare setting but did not give it to them because the pieces would be lost in a day.  Good for people with small fingers.
0,1,This is a good gift. Lots of pretend play time in the kitchen.  5 year old has really played with both items and they still look like new.
0,1,"We have been taking a few out a time to play with. He likes to put them in the sand box. Great imaginative play. Not just for sorting, counting navy identifying colors. They are sturdy and have good detail."
0,1,"I've started a collection of math manipulatives to help my children with our math for homeschooling.  I had a set of these bugs from discovery toys.  That is a great set because it is a smaller amount of bugs with pattern cards (great for preschool and kindergarten).  But, if you bought just the bugs (I found these at a garage sale yesterday), it would be very easy to replicate those activities simply by helping children count using the bugs and create patterns.  I am very glad to have extra bugs now!For Preschool, I use the book Developing Number Concepts by Kathy Richardson:  Bk 1.  I love that book and these bugs would be really fun for kids to use for those activities!  Kathy Richardson does a wonderful job explaining what young children need to learn to develop their number sense--it's the best book I've found around.  The activities are very simple and quick."
1,0,"We love these bugs.  I got them for my oldest two children we homeschool so when it came time to start the younger ones in preschool we got them again.  They love them!  Ages are 2,3 and 4.  We don't have them out to play with, we just get them out for ""school"" so they think they are really special and don't realize they are learning with them.  My older children play the bug soup game with them!"
0,1,"I love how this has a variety of math facts - fractions, decimals, etc. It's perfect for homeschooling and learning math. It's just another way to help my daughter learn aside from worksheets and computer games. It gives a visual of what a whole is, half, a fourth, etc. I personally do better with visual learning and wanted to give her a variety of options to learn her math."
0,1,"We are a homeschooling family that likes to take a hands on approach as often as possible. I bought these because my 1st grader is just starting to work with fractions. When she had them out working with them yesterday, my high schooler wanted to play with them also. They do exactly what you would expect them to do. They are small/hand size. If you were in a classroom setting they would be great for individual students to use at their desk. One thing that really impressed me is that the colors of the bars match up to the colors of the same fractions of this circle fraction setLearning Resources - Rainbow Fraction Deluxe Circles, Math Manipulatives, For Grades 1 and Upwhich we purchased at the same time. The whole 1 on both is red, 1/2 is pink, 1/3 is orange and so on. This made it very easy to talk about and match up fractions for 1st grader. There are to many fractions for this to be an accident. I'm really glad I purchased them together. We will be using this math tool and it's corresponding circle set for many years to come.Another reviewer said their set didn't include the decimals or percents. Mine does, maybe they just got a set that didn't make it all the way through the print cycle."
0,1,"My 11 month old weighs 22lbs, so I really needed something that would be solid and strong as he tries to learn to walk. Some of the walkers we'd use at play group or at friends' houses were too light, and when he'd push on them, he'd go flying forward. So I really, really appreciate this toy. It remains stable as he stands up, and moves at just the right speed when he pushes it. The music on it is pleasant, it has an on/off switch with volume control, and it has different settings. It isn't really a toy for  him to just sit there and play with it for a long period of time, because like some of the reviewers wrote, it has to be moving to really get it going and do a lot. I still give it 5 stars anyway, because I really appreciate it as a walker."
0,1,My daughter really enjoys this game and it is really cute! Thanks for the fast shipping...Awesome Christmas present!
1,0,Another of my 3 year old's collection - he loves it and has mastered it well.  Very well done.
0,1,"Got this for my daughter and ended up not giving it to her.  I tried it out  - turned on the movie and waited and waited for it to do something. Yes, it did. Bopped her head to music, made some comments. After watching 25 minutes of the movie, she did three things.  The only fun with her is to watch the movie - and though my daughter loves watching it  - isn't something she's going to always be watching.  The cat is pretty loud, and not really the cutest plush toy out there.Figured she'd be frustrated waiting for it to do something, and that it would just end up forever sitting in the toy box along with all the talking Care Bears, etc.So returned her to the store  - and instead found a much larger plush Serafina, almost a body pillow size.  This one is such a pretty Serafina.  Was half the price of the annoying talking one, and now looks so pretty sitting on her bed."
1,0,How dissapointing!!!  This toy is so cute but if you look at it wrong it falls apart.  THe design is also very weird and it is not easy to play with.  My SSC but pass on this one unless on sale for really really cheap.
0,1,Our son enjoys putting these together.  He is thrilled when he successfully makes a looped circuit & his goal comes to life.
1,0,This product is fun and educational for children.  They are able to use their imaginations to make many different items.
1,0,"I just gave this to my grandson for his birthday, hasn't had a lot of time to use it, I think he will enjoy it"
0,1,"Our daughter still enjoys playing with this easel, 3 years later!  It has held up well and was easy to assemble.  Purchased the paint kit and easel paper pad to go with it, and it comes with chalk and eraser.  Supplies have lasted a long time for us.  Recommend this for child who likes to draw, paint, or write."
0,1,"Like:adjustable heightfairly easy to assemble if you read the directions and an extra handthe clipsthe traysthe colorful knobsthe paper roll option is handy and the cutterdon't like:the blackboard doesn't work well despite my chaulking it up (priming it) as I read. I plan on painting it and hope that works.the paper with the same brand doesn't fit length wise but I can live with that.The clips don't fit along the sides near the bottom half (because it's too thick) as I preferThere are only 3 adjustable heights, thought there might be more.In hindsight, I would have to gotten another similar one. But not worth it to return and replace it at this point."
0,1,"The quality of the easel is great, nice size for my daughter who is 8. Only one thing is don't like is my daughter needs help getting the paper through the paper cutter."
0,1,"Too bad I could not send this back in time for Christmas morning, but I didn't bother to put it together until Christmas Eve.Negatives:The dry erase board has air pockets in the corners underneath the clear sheet of plastic, and it makes it a rough surface.The bottom part of the stand (the legs) are warped and bent inward and outwards, which makes the whole thing a bit wobbly and it looks crooked.The pre-drilled holes for the dry-erase board did not line up too well, and I had to force one of the bolts through.Positives:Easy to build.  Took me about 20 minutes while watching t.v.Knobs and bolts make it a sturdy build, other than the wobbly legs.Plastic trays are big and sturdy.Cleans easily (but if you get marker on the wooden parts, it is there to stay.)"
0,1,My grandsons love this easel.  It is easy to use and helps contain their artistic creativity and little messes.  You'll enjoy it!
1,0,"I was pretty excited to get this.  We have many M&D; toys, and we usually love them.  In most cases  it seems the designers think of everything.  That does not hold true for this product.  Other reviewers have covered these these points, so I'll try to be brief.1. The chalkboard is terrible.  I will be buying some chalkboard paint to make it usable (adding to the cost).2. The white board does not wipe clean well.  It stains easily from all the dry erase marker types I have tried, so I have to use the dry erase spray (again more $- though I may try the rubbing alcohol someone else mentioned).3. I wish the white board (or chalkboard) was magnetic.  It would really add a lot to the toy and I'd have all the letters off my fridge!4. The height is not very easily adjustable, and it does not seem so easy to fold though I haven't really tried yet.5. The plastic trays seem to add a lot to the stability, but they do not seem to be made from very strong plastic.  I am hoping they will last a while, but I'm not too optimistic.  If/when they break, I think we'll have to add some wood to reinforce it.Overall, I think I could have found a better easel.  The chalk and whiteboard on the IKEA easel work very well (know others that have it), but I don't know whether or not IKEA's is magnetic.  Some of the plastic ones are and I'd really like that feature.  If there was a way to add that myself (like chalkboard paint) I might consider it.  You may want to shop around more.  It's a large item, so more versatility is always better if it's going to be taking up a lot of space.Overall, my biggest complaint is that it has 2 poor quality writing surfaces.  Without the paper, it's not very usable.  I hope this helps.***update 12/11:  still haven't figured out how to fold it up, at least not reasonably easily, so it takes up a ridiculous amount of space."
0,1,"Nice easel, for the price.  The features I love are...the trays to hold suppliesit folds up so I can put it in the closethas a place to put the roll of paperis lightweight for maneuvering around as we do the painting outdoors"
0,1,"I bought this for my granddaughter three years ago for Christmas and it has been in constant use ever since. She now uses the dry erase board for doing her homework; but,her little sister draws everything from abstracts to landscapes. I've gotten quite a nice album of pictures worth saving on my computer. It's lasted over three years with three children and hasn't broken or needed repaired. This present has outlived many other toys that cost a lot more. If anything did happen to this board, I would buy another in a heartbeat. Great Product!"
0,1,"I was worried about purchasing this after reading some of the negative reviews, but once I assembled it I could tell it was going to last. It's sturdy and well made, and the trays on both sides are nice and large. I rubbed the chalkboard with chalk as advised and I've had no problems with it whatsoever (using Crayola sidewalk chalk). The height adjustment option is excellent; I know my sons will be using this for quite a few years to come. It was very easy to assemble; the instructions are very clear."
0,1,"I read the reviews for several days before I decided to purchase it as a Christmas gift for my 4 yr old daughter. The price was excellent, less than $40. I received it within a few days using amazon.com free shipping. My daughter has created several works of art already. I purchased the easel companion set from the school box store since it was sold out online. It took my husband about thirty minutes to set it up. We didn't have any issues with the chalkboard...it is smooth and easy to write on.  My daughter was familiar with the paint cups from school. She lined the cups with zip lock bags to prevent staining(great idea!). I didn't notice a stronger than usual paint smell...acutally I didn't smell the paint at all."
0,1,"Nice enough easel. But cheap pine, splintered and cracked, even warped- showed up in the big box at my door. Sigh. Bummer. I had been planning (and looking forward to) on this purchase for 2 years, and then to recieve sub-par quality bummed me out. I like it though. It wil work. But really, do yourself a favor and just go make your own, or have one done locally. I do like the paper roll feature, that really rocks."
0,1,"Not only is this a sturdy, well made wooden easel, it comes with so many positive usage and storage capabilities.  Best of all is the paper roll in the center.  You can purchase this paper for a small price on Amazon also from Melissa & Doug.  The roll rests inside of the easel comes over the top edge for cutting.  The paper is almost as wide as the easel itself.  The accessories sold separately, are a must.  Fits snuggly in place in storage trays.  The easel also closes flat for storage.  Dry Erase board, chalk board, and side for clipping paper to make paintings and drawings. My grandchildren love it."
1,0,"My daughter (now 7) received this easel for her 2nd birthday and it is still one of the favorite toys in our playroom.  It is incredibly durable having survived 3 moves and frequent play.  The chalkboard needed to be ""seasoned"" when we first received it.  I read some other reviews that explained how to do this and we have never had a problem with it.  It has so much functionality with the chalkboard, the white board and the painting easel.  Every child should have this versatile toy!"
0,1,"Bought this for my daughter (4 years old) for Christmas. Went together with fair ease and it looks great!! Daughter is already having a blast!! Easy for her to use. I did buy the accessories bundle. Highly recommend buying it! Spill proof cups and lids to keep the unused paint fresh are wonderful! Way kid friendly! It's adjustable so it will grow with her. You can buy the roll paper or the tablet, comes with the pieces to hold both. So glad I got it! I love Melissa and Doug toys! Have never had a problem with any of them and this just keeps the record going! LOVE IT and even more so my daughter does!"
1,0,"My 6-year-old daughter loves her easel. It is sturdy, and a very good height for her (she is tall for her age). I love that it has a chalkboard on one side, and the dry erase board on the other, 2 kids can draw at 1 time. Kids can also use the easel for painting. We also bought the accessory set and a roll of paper to go along with it. It is a little hard to cut the paper and pull more through, so I usually have to help her do it. Other than that though, it's a great product. I recommend it for kids ages 3-9."
1,0,"All Melissa and Doug products are made so well and we love them all.  We have this easel, the accessory kit and the smock.  Thanks."
0,1,"Given the choice I would have bought a Kidkraft but they would not ship to APO address :(  However, for the price so far I am very satisfied.  I feel there was more assembly required than necessary, allow about 40 minutes to do it right.  Make sure the head of the screw ends up on the notched part of the wood or it will seem the screw isn't long enough.  The white board and chalkboard worked just fine, I did not have to do any prep to it.  On the white board we've used markers and crayons without a problem.  White and colored chalk write well on the chalkboard.  Both boards are very thin (particle board).  One of the screws was already threaded and no extras were provided.  No doubt this is a cheap easel but it's competitive in price.  The wood is not finished but I suppose your little artist can have fun painting it.I like the use of a roll of paper instead of pad but you can also clip sheets if you like.  The trays are nice, I also bought the Melissa & Doug paint cups and they fit perfect.  I like that the height is adustable, lets hope it lasts until we get to the top."
0,1,"I managed to put this together in under an hour, barely looking at the instructions (still double-checked at the end), and I'm not mechanically inclined and used no tools other than what is in the package...they gave me the exact number of screws etc. that I needed and a little L wrench which I didn't even really need to use because of the way the screws and caps are made. There are a LOT of pieces but like I said, easy to put together. The chalkboard part is like painted green wood, but still usable as a chalkboard and with no fingernail scratching possibilities. There were no rough edges or splinters in the easel and the screws are all recessed and capped nicely so kids can't get at them. Well-made and seems sturdy. My son can slide it around the kitchen. If you have wooden or ceramic tile flooring I recommend getting 4 tennis balls and (carefully) using an exacto knife to cut a small slit in each ball, and then put a ball on each leg of the easel. This saves your floors and makes for easy moving. The utensil trays are great, and the height is adjustable--my child at 32 inches tall easily reaches the easel. I haven't used the paper-cutting part so I can't comment on that, but otherwise all in all this a great buy and I'm so happy I got this for my little man."
0,1,"We first got this easel about a year ago for my son's birthday.  He had just turned 2 and this simple design was low enough that it allowed him to reach most of the surfaces.  It was wonderful then.  Unfortunately, a year later, not so wonderful.The good points to this easel?  As I said, it's low enough that my 2 year old was able to use it with no problem.  The trays on each side were perfect for storing his art supplies or his paints.  He was able to have everything in easy reach.  Unlike others we never really had many problems with the chalk board.  It was faint, but it worked just the way my kids liked it, so I didn't worry about it too much.  No nails-on-the-chalkboard sound and no squeaking chalk made me a happy mom.  The paper was a little tricky to get through the guide up top so I had to help my kids each time, no matter who was using it.  That was frustrating, but it wasn't as bad as it could have been.  The clips were useful.  The whole thing was also wonderfully easy to clean.  My son got paint on the dry-erase board and it came off after drying without a problem.The down side was this didn't last our move well.  A couple of the screw caps broke.  My daughter (9) decided to show her brothers how to take the screws out, so now half of them are missing.  It's not in as bad shape as it could have been, but we're now down a shelf on one side because the screws to attach it are gone.  I have to admit, I haven't tried contacting the company for replacements yet, but the point is they didn't last well.Overall the product isn't bad, and if you catch it on a good sale, it's not a bad price either.  It's a nice little easel, and it was fine as long as it was stationary in our house.  It wasn't until we moved that we had problems with the screws breaking.  I can imagine this would be a problem for anyone who has to move it around to store it to.  It's not the sturdiest of things.  It also doesn't fold up terribly well with the paper roll on the easel as well.Personally I don't think I would buy it again, but that's because I would opt for a more expensive item with a better look to it.  It served it's purpose, taking the abuse a 2 year old would give it.  It's still in good working order, so I can't complain too much, but I would opt for something a little higher end next time."
0,1,"Many reviews have noted ""Great for the price!"" but Ikea has one for thirteen dollars less and the same/better quality (although lacking the other tray) so my review will not be based on ""Great for the price."" The chalkboard had a HUGE gash on it straight out of the box. The way the box was packaged and intact it had to have happened before it was shipped.. somewhere on the assembly line. After reading many reviews prior to purchase I thought I might as well just buy the chalkboard paint and fix the gash myself. For anyone doing this themselves the chalkboard paint was kind of a fiasco from my experience since it came out all uneven (waited... sanded... sprayed again... ugh) .. but you may be a better spray-painter than I. Nevertheless my two star rating will not be based on my painting fiasco. Rather, it is based on the quality. Many places the cheap wood is badly cracked and came that way out of the box (mostly where the pre-drilled holes are). Some wood became cracked when the screws were tightened (believe me.. I didn't tighten that much). Just for reference, I can put a scratch in the wood with my fingernail. When you fold it up to store the product the red wood pieces on the side of the easel dig into the natural wood causing it to chip off.Does my child love it? Yes YES YES!!!Will it last more than a month or two? No.My opinion: If you live near an Ikea you may want to check out theirs. At least if theirs breaks you won't feel as bad for the price.Side note: The bundled easel paper Amazon is marketing with this easel is not the right width for this easel. My child is a bit older and is more controlled and careful with his art.. a younger child may end up painting all over the easel making clean up more of a chore."
0,1,"my children (ages 2 and 1) LOVE LOVE LOVE this easel.  they have a pack of washable crayons for one side (we got the roll of paper to cover up the dry-erase board) and a few pieces of colored and white chalk for the other side.  they use both [the chalk and the crayons] on both sides, and even on the board it is easy to remove.the chalkboard is easy to write on and shows the colored crayons vibrantly.washable crayon on the dry-erase side wipes away easily (with just a tissue, no water).  my kids are too little to realize that they need to stay on the paper!  (incidentally i have to use water to get the crayon off the walls....)i love the fact this frame is wooden and not plastic.  it is fully adjustable, i have it on the lowest setting for my two children.  as they grow, i can make it higher and higher.  right now, they can easily reach the whole thing, but their hands tend to focus at the bottom.  it will last for many years to come!!!"

0,1,"What a great game for families. We are big strategy game players at our house, usually choosing games that emphasize visual brain power. This game stimulates kinesthetic learning as players race the clock to assemble ten rectangular pillars of different colors into designs pictured on the cards inside. Players earn points, based on difficulty.  This durable game is lots of fun. My one tiny complaint is with the timer. It just doesn't feel sturdy and the mark that shows where one is setting the time is barely noticable. Time to get out a Sharpie and color the mark black. I hope the timer lasts as long as the rest of this great game. One thing to note--this game would not work for a color blind player as one has to put certain colors in certain places, although there are some grey cards that don't specify colors. A family with one or more color blind players could pull those cards and use them, or find an additional way to label the blocks.Recommended."
1,0,"This is a pretty fun game for kids. On a player's turn a card is drawn with an image of a structure that the player has to build with the blocks. Some require the same colored blocks in the exact places, and other cards only require the structure, so colored blocks can be used any way desired. There is a timer and a player can build as many structures as they're able until the timer goes off.  There are also two decks of cards, an easier group and a harder group.  Even with me using the harder cards and my 8 y.o. using the easier ones, I really had to purposefully slow myself down in order to make the game seem close and not beat her with a landslide.Our daughter loves games and we try to find games that we can play with her without us having to ""dumb ourselves down"" (for lack of a better description) and pretend it's harder than it is in order to play it with her. There are a lot of games out there that adults can play with kids in which they can fully use their own skills and knowledge which makes it more enjoyable (forbidden island is a great example and is our current favorite kids game). To us it feels patronizing and untruthful to have to ""pretend"" that a game is harder or more interesting than it really is in order to play it with our daughter. We'd rather play games that really are engaging for all ages rather than pretending that they are.If you have kids that will play together then this game would be great for them. For adults playing with kids, you'll have to pretend it's harder than it is or else you'll easily beat the kids which isn't very fun or fair for them."
0,1,"This game is a timer based one. It makes you create building blocks, and there is a randomness/timer aspect of this game. The timer is mechanical and makes a whrrr sound. This is fun. The blocks are all color coded and the puzzle has different levels of complexity (complex puzzle creation, simple puzzle creation, ignore/don't ignore color modes). This is fun and several people can play it together. It is fun to play at the end of a day and interact with kids/family members. We have it for several years and never bored with this game."
0,1,Here are the PLUSES:1.  It is portable2.  It features the Little People3.  The Pen comes attachedNow for the minuses:1.  You can't fully erase the marks on the board with just one or two swipes of the eraser soccer ball2.  The three magnetic shapes WILL GET LOST ALMOST IMMEDIATELY3.  The size of it is just too bulky for easy portability.  Smaller versions are better for small hands.
1,0,"I just finished calling customer service about this toy and they're sending me a voucher to purchase a different model as it's substandard to me and my son.(UPDATE: I have now purchased the ""Doodle Pro Basic"" model and it is infinitely easier for my son to use; we are all happy!)Good:-Not electronic toy that kids enjoy-EDUCATIONAL.-Only a little effort by the child and they have a ""drawing""-Doesn't have annoying sounds (quiet toy)-Promotes doodling-Keeps crayons/markers off walls, shirts, rugs, tables in this messy young stage.-The shapes were easy to use for instant effect, he made many ""pictures"" with shapes only.-Fisher Price customer service is top notch.-(Update!) my son drew his first non-scribble drawing ever on here: a big truck!!Bad:-The pen is corded.  Even though I risked loosing the pen I cut it off from the string immediately as it was impossible to use for him.  They said they have to abide by strangulation rules, so there's not much they can do.-Magnets are way too strong (triangle, circle, square) - he was enraged many times and frustrated he couldn't get them out.-The soccer ball slider is very hard to push for young hands, even an almost 3 year old.-The slider has to go over a 'virtual hump' and it's gotten harder to use even for me, it took some paint off the plastic too.-No matter how many 'wipes' with the slider the surface shows ghosting and gets worse over time.-Now that I look at it, it's tacky looking (sorry).  The huge boy with balloons sticking out isn't necessary.  They should have just painted it on versus making them protrude.-The pen must be perfectly written with in a top-down fashion or it writes poorly because of the magnet.  Kids write at an angle and this won't pick up on that.So in summary pass on this specific Doodle Pro and pick another one, as I will.  I LOVE the idea but this execution is quite poor."
0,1,"This toy is great for 2 reasons:1) My daughter loves playing with it off and on all day.2) She has tons of Peek-A-Blocks and they can all be stored in the incrediblock.  She can find them when she wants to play with them and they aren't all over my house. :)I recommend this toy, I think it has fun activities that will grow with them."
0,1,I rate this as a good toy overall because I have only found one thing with it I don't like...the motor is a little noisey..I had read other reviews on this toy saying the same thing..my daughter just turned 1 on Nov. 22 and she got this for a gift..she loved it from the moment we brought it into her sight..She loves to stand at it and knock the blocks off of it over and over again..she has probably over 50 blocks now and beleive it or not it holds everyone of them....good storage too..they all are in one spot for easy access for her..I give it five stars for fun because I even like getting down and playing with her..Educational value is great too because they learn to stack the blocks good eye hand cordination skills are learned through this...Durability is  a five because my daughter loves to climb..she is a bit on the small size in weight but she has been walking and climbing on things since she was 10 1/2 months old and she can't seem to destroy this toy yet...I would buy this for any friend who had a child.

1,0,We love this!  My son loves to make music and this is a great tool to use to do so.
0,1,"This little drum has been extremely entertaining for my children. They absolutely love music and I am very happy when I find low cost, quality instruments for them to explore.  This drum has held up nicely, despite my toddler's rather rough playing. The mallet is pretty awful. It is foam, so it took about a day before someone took a bit out of it. Within a week, the mallet was trash. We went to a local music store and grabbed a hard rubber mallet for them to use with their drum to replace the foam one. (Why does any company make kid things out of foam? They simply cannot resist biting the squishy stuff!) The drum head is made out of plastic on this particular drum, but it makes a great sound and is very durable. The lollipop styling makes it even more fun! I absolutely recommend this drum (just be prepared to replace the mallet, you may want to go ahead and remove the mallet for younger ones because they can choke on the pieces) and will be buying more Remo Kids products in the future."
0,1,"Very durable, kept in the toy box and still works good... we have 2 and going back for the 3rd size this year to have a complete set. I love that its flat and so doesn't take up a lot of space."
0,1,"I returned this product.  The sound quality is acceptable only when it is played while being held in an upright position, which may be difficult for very young children due to the size of the drum.  The sound quality is very poor when it is played while on a flat surface such as a table."
1,0,"This is worth the extra money compared to other kid drums. The quality is very nice, and it doesn't sound irritating or harsh to me at all. It's very sturdy and has a pleasant sound. I recommend it!"
1,0,"The Remo Kids Percussion floor drum is exactly as pictured.The Rain Forest fabric assures it will last a long time, and stand up to ""kid use"" very well.It feels good, looks good and is a superior instrument for an introduction to music.My grandnephew is 4 years old, and this drum is the perfect size for him."
0,1,"My now 3 year old daughter has had this drum since she was about 6 months old. It is super sturdy!! She loved it then, and loves it now.  It has a very pleasant sound, even when she is banging away I usually don't mind.  It seems to bring out the rhythm from her heart!  My 7 month old son now loves it too.  We just sit him in front of it and he pats and hits away, also with rhythm.  We love this little drum, and it just dawned on me it is the perfect baby gift, especially if your friends are at all musically inclined.  The whole family will love it, and it will last for years to come. SOLID!!"
0,1,My son loves instruments and this one didn't disappoint.  It has a great sound and the mallets are really nice too.  I plan to buy more instruments from this line.  Good quality as well.
0,1,"The 3 year old loves his drum, and so does his sister, parents, friends....It came with two mallets but know this family, I bought extra mallets so everyone could get in on the action! Highly recommend! Price- incredible, shipping, very well protected."
0,1,"This is the coolest drum I've seen.  Soem that I've seen have a really cheap top that could easily be punctured...and they are over 20 bucks... this one is very thick and sturdy for only a bit more.  I just can't believe how good the quality is.  The sound the mallots make on it are incredible.  I'm really pleased.  I got it for my daughter's 2nd birthday (she LOVES drums) and she absolutely loves it, and it is something that will grow with her.  Such great quality and an amazing price."
1,0,"This drum is extremely high quality and the sound is great for the price but I find that my child was senselessly banging on a drum and then just got bored of it after a while. I think for the same price parents should consider the alternative toy ""Toysmith Parum Pum Pum Drum"".  The quality on this Remo percussion is 10x better but the playtime on the Parum Pum Pum Drum is exponentially better of kids. There's more musical gadgets and doohickeys that come with the Parum Pum Drum and although it doesn't have a better drum sound, my eardrums and sanity gladly welcomes the more soother and subtle sounds."
1,0,I got this for my 2 year old's birthday and it has been a huge hit! It is very well made and sturdy and the sound quality is quite good. I saw the same drum in a teacher's music supply catalog for almost twice as much with no mallets included. I am very happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend this drum!
0,1,"i bought this for my nephew (2 y/o). it is awesome!! it sounds so good and has a real deep sound. i purposely bought it along with a set of kids bongos to drive my brother crazy.  im 28 years old and i find myself playing it everytime i go over his house.  A year and half now and it is still holding up to the punishment of a 2 year old boy, a 5 year old girl and a 10 month old boy. Def a good buy."
1,0,"Very well made, nice sounding and the kids love it. Comes with 2 mallets.  Excellent for the beginner who is getting into the drums and the sound of music! Makes a great gift for the grand kids! Cloth sides with colorful animals adds a very nice touch!"
0,1,"The Remo drum w/Mallet is an extremely durable drum.  A friend of mine got it as a gift for their daughter when she was one. She is now four and has a little brother. The drum has been used on a daily basis and has genuinely been loved and played with. I totally disagree with the reviewer that gave this ""toy"" a 3 star review. Any ""toy"" that can survive three years of play with two toddlers and loved that much is not a ""toy"" in my book!  I have seen the children use the mallets or sticks with the drum. I have even seen them stand on the drum.  At the end of the day, we put our marching band instruments back onto the shelf and give them a rest!  A truly memorable gift and I am here tonight buying it for yet another little one's first Christmas. A gift that shall be enjoyed for many years and not one that breaks on Christmas day.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
0,1,"These are the drums that we use at Music Together. But at the class we use the gathering drum. I didn't want one so big so I got this one. Pluses: It's very sturdy and you can drum using the mallets or your hands. I can drum with my toddler. She loves it. Cons: It's pretty loud. Not sure if it's because we have hardwood floors and at Music Together class they have carpet. It's a great drum, but louder than I expected."
0,1,"My kids played with this for hours every day for a week straight.  Once colored it is still a fun playhouse for them.  They love the mail slot and pretending to deliver mail.  And if it's junk mail or a bill they throw it back out the window.  So much fun for them to pretend!  Good quality and easy to fold up and get out of the way.  Sets back up in under a minute once you get the hang of it.Only complaint is the door thresholds which are a skinny 2&#34; piece of cardboard at the bottom which promptly gets torn off when you have two kids running in and out of the house.  Could have been reinforced better or designed differently.  You don't really need the piece at the bottom of the door, but the house does become less stable and the walls tend to slide outward more often when the door threshold is no longer in place."
0,1,it is a big loud drum I bought for my niece to exact revenge on my sister for years of crap.  I can't think of a better way to &#34;send my love&#34;- I'll be buying a trumpet for her next birthday.
0,1,"This is a wonderful, high quality drum for kids.  They make professional drums and these are the same quality.  My daughter has loved it since she was 9 months old.  It is worth the extra cost, she will be using it for a long time."
0,1,"This is the one toy my children never get bored with. We used a combination of Ryan's Room and Plan toys for furniture, and used calico critters for the &#34;dolls&#34;. I bought some light wood colored shelf liner to give them hard wood floors and added some white textured wallpaper. I also ended up cutting some felt and pasting it down to some thin board for removable carpeting. It was pretty easy to put together. It is kinda dark, I'd like to install some dollhouse lights if I ever get brave enough to drill holes in it."
0,1,"We absolutely love this dollhouse! We purchased it specifically because it was wooden and it did not have any embelishments on it. I wanted my kids to be able to use their imaginations as to the lay out of the house and change it up if they wanted to; no predetermined kitchen, bath, etc. We outfitted it with Plan Toys dolls and furniture and it works just great. We also bought the basement. Altogether, it is quite large. This is definitely a toy that is going to go the distance."
1,0,Bought this doll for my granddaughter to use at bathtime while Mamma bathes the new baby. It is designed to be able to play in the tub but water does collect in her head and it takes several hours for the body to dry.  The body is not rubber like the head but has a bead filler of some kind.  We have to hang it up over the bath shelf to dry and when she is bathed she is usually not dry for bedtime.  So we have to decide would we rather bathe her or sleep with her.  A little concerned that the inside might be getting mildewy or moldy.  Probably will not become a favorite bathtime toy.
0,1,"Like many parents, I want my small son to learn as much about mathematics, computer programming, chemistry, robotics and physics as he can from an early age (and in a healthy non-forced manner). Purchased this Physics set for him to begin receiving exposure to concepts such as velocity, acceleration, mass, Newton's three laws, gravity and an early introduction to the ideas that made Newton conceive of calculus.It is a well packaged set that is not that dissimilar from a LEGO set at first glance. The main problem is the instruction manual is not that clear and for many of the experiments, no mention is made of how to build the machines displayed within. For the educated parent, who has a bit of scientific expertise and can tinker around a bit, the problem is not that bad. But handing this to say, an intelligent 12 year old child would probably produce a great deal of frustration. I must also say this kit is focused mostly on gravity, forces, the laws of motion and kinematics and is not what you want if also want your child to learn about electricity, magnetism or electrical circuits.So, overall, not a bad kit or one that teaches lessons incorrectly, but simply one that is not that clear with muddling diagrams and explanations that a bit vague for the average child or parent."
0,1,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7-year-old grandson.  We previously gave him the Thames & Kosmos Remote Control Machines for Christmas.  He did all the projects in that book several times and began creating his own machines.When he opened the Physics Workshop and looked at a few of the pictures in the book, he began building his own variations of those ideas.  In the days following his birthday party, he settled down and, with his dad, read the description of a project and then constructed it.When his dad was a boy, he always helped me take things apart, fix them and put them back together.  By the time he was 12, I was helping him take things apart, repairing them and putting them back together.  I did some of the same with my father."
0,1,"This tool kit has the making of a very good educational experience.  Unfortunately it could be executed much better.  Explanations for how to do the experiments are basically just a couple of pictures of the finished product in various stages of being put together.The problem is that is rarely sufficient to determine how critical pieces should fit together.  But when they work they can be really fun.  For example, the all-terrain vehicle works really well and my 9 yr old grandson got a kick out of that.In general, the explanation for the ""physics"" behind the experiment are not well explained certainly not for young kids.  I was a physics major in college (long ago)...but even still the explanations often left me wondering."
0,1,"What a fun intro to physics.  My kids (girl 6, boy 4) love it and ask to play it (the love giving ideas on how to make it work).  It's great that the construction is just as much fun as the swooping b/s it takes up a lot of room and we can't leave it out.  We've used it a few times over the last year and it's held up well (only a couple of broken details).  On a hard floor, it is very challenging to know where all the balls go."
0,1,"We have had so much fun with this marble run - it is very versatile.  We put a big loop in the track and attached it to our TV cabinet - the smaller marbles made it like champs.  there were a few glow-in-the-dark marbles and they're a hoot if you turn all the lights off and send them through the run.  Anyway, we haven't had it long so I don't know how well it holds up but, with a little imagination, this toy gives tons of fun!  It's been great to watch my grandson use his creative abilities to come up with endless numbers of run configurations.  I'd recommend this to anyone"
0,1,"My family has always enjoyed puzzles and we are beyond pleased with this one! Absolutely no complaints on quality. The pieces fit together ideally, smooth, not too tight, not too loose. The image quality is beautiful, not fuzzy like other puzzles I've seen. What a great piece of art for a puzzle too..the many, many shades of gray lend to a very challenging and satisfying puzzle! This one will fill many hours or evenings, so clear a good space to keep this one out. Fun, fun, fun!I will certainly be seeking out more premium Ravensburger puzzles in the future!"
0,1,"We have dozens of jigsaw puzzles in our house, and of all the brands, Ravensburger never disappoints. So I was happy to have a chance to review a Ravensburger for Vine, and talk them up!Compared to other brands, the cardboard is nice and heavy, the printing doesn't peel off as easily (we've taken them apart and put them back together, repeatedly) and each piece is slightly different, unlike cheap puzzles that only have 1 or 2 shapes for their pieces.  Even the box is sturdy and made for generations to pass on. All this quality comes at a reasonable price, and they come out with tons of puzzles, so if I see a Ravensburger selling for around $10, I jump on it.We've started to put this puzzle together, and it's quite challenging with the black-and-white photo, yet the buildings in the background offer more visual interest than a solid color."
0,1,"We bought two of these for our puzzle-obsessed 3.5 y.o. to do with Dad. When we first opened the boxes we were immediately impressed buy the quality of the pieces, both the thickness and the paper. These seem very durable and have already provided hours of entertainment. The color quality of the pictures is beautiful and we couldn't be happier with them."
1,0,This is a really nice puzzle! I would buy more from this brand!  My niece loved it as well as my daughters.  It has nice sturdy pieces! And pretty colors and pictures.
0,1,"I love the puzzle. It is very colorful. My four year old kids can put it together with no problems. They have broken two pieces though, so I wish it were a little thicker."
0,1,"Another winner by Ravensburger, nice big pieces and the perfect number for 3 to 4 year olds.  A favorite of my little girl."
0,1,"I have a one year old son who is blind and I bought this for his birthday.  I'd never seen one and I just love it!  Textures everywhere, different too.  Bendable, shape-able, fun for grown ups too haha!  I have a 5 year old who also likes this.  Nice toy...excellent price."
0,1,"I bought this to keep my hands distracted.  I have OCD which causes me to pick at my skin, this toy really keeps my hands busy so I've cut down on thus destructive behavior.  However,  this thing is very loud and sometimes while using it at night it wakes up my boyfriend."
0,1,"I thought this car was supposed to move! It doesn't do anything but honk, which it only does once after I take out the batteries, replace them, and then put the little man into his seat. After that it just sits there. My LO doesn't even look at this toy, much less try to play with it. She learned after the first few tries that her efforts were futile, however I keep trying. What a joke! Don't bother."
0,1,"This is a good puzzle to work on and it will keep the family together assembling it for quite a while. The pieces are well cut and are made from a sturdy material. They fit very snugly and the whole puzzle has a nice quality feeling to it once it is done. The puzzle image has a few zones that make different pieces of the puzzle hard to differentiate and position, but based on their different shapes and the way they are cut, we managed to put them together without much trouble - but they were, hmm, a puzzle! A very good challenge for both adults and juniors."
0,1,"Disclaimer: I am reviewing a puzzle that I received for free through the Vine program.This is a good puzzle, like most of the puzzles from this company Ravensburger. The image, of dolphins, is a good one, the family loves it. The manufacturing quality is good as usual for this company. The size, 500 pieces, is just right for my (autistic) daughter to complete the entire puzzle in one or two days.overall I would recommend it if you are looking for another good puzzle."
0,1,"My 8 1/2 year old daughter loves doing puzzles.  I have bought her plenty of run-of-the-mill type puzzles, but never a Ravensburger puzzle.  This puzzle sells for around $10 on Amazon.com, and if you have never bought one, you might wonder why it costs more than your average puzzle. First off, with this puzzle you don't have to figure out how to open the box without wrecking it.  The box has a paper wrapped lid and bottom that lifts off without having to cut anything.  Love that!  The puzzle itself is enclosed in a sealed plastic bag.  The only thing that could make this package better is to make that plastic bag a zip-top bag so I don't have to do that myself.  The underside of the puzzle is a medium blue color.  Ravensberger puzzles are made in Germany, that may give you an indication of the quality of this puzzle.On the box The dimensions of this puzzle are listed as 49 x 36 cm, which works out to 19.29 x 14.17 in inches.  It's not a huge puzzle, and the pieces are somewhat smaller also.  The average piece is around 1""x1"", if you include the parts that stick out to interlock with other pieces.  I think my daughter can do this puzzle.  The artwork is beautiful, and there are a lot of vibrant colors.  The puzzle should last a long time, as the material that it is made out of is very sturdy.  It should be a fun afternoon's activity.  This Ravensburger puzzle, or any other, would make a great gift for someone who enjoys puzzles."
0,1,"This is my 6th Ravensburger puzzles and I'm totally spoiled! I find that I don't even want to bother with other brands. While this was a 500 piece puzzle, it was fairly simple to complete because there weren't large areas that looked the same. The entire thing took me about two hours. As for the puzzle itself, as with every Ravensburger puzzle I've done the following applies.1. The image isn't glossy.  This is very nice when working on a table under a ceiling light because there was no glare.  The quality of the image is exceptional too.2. When I emptied the pieces, there were no pieces still stuck together where I had to tear them apart and they were nice and thick.3. Every piece was cut different so there was never a time where I the wrong piece fit into an area leaving me with a problem down the road.4. The finished product went together well and looked great.I did notice on the box that they advertise ""Soft Click Technology"".  I feel that this leads buyers to assume there will be a clicking sound and the pieces will snap together.  I can say, there was no clicking at all when I put the puzzle together.  Instead, it just means that the pieces fit together very well."
1,0,"I enjoy Ravensburger Puzzles, and must admit that I am quickly becoming a bit of a puzzle snob now. Regular puzzles with their ""sawdust"" everywhere and poor quality of materials simply don't interest me. This puzzle is another example of good quality Ravensburger Puzzles. The material is solidly constructed, there isn't much ""sawdust"" to the puzzle, and the scenes are gorgeous. My only ""complaint"" is that sometimes their water scenes can be so similar as to not really stand out from one another, and I know that in real life, oceanic life from one place to another can differ quite a bit. My hope is that they will branch out with their artistry to have the oceanic scenes not be so similar."
0,1,"I like the Ravensburger puzzles, they feel stronger than regular puzzles. This one took about 5 hours to complete as there are many bluish pieces."
0,1,"I was working on this puzzle when I walked by the counter I had it set up on randomly at times, then my Enginerd came home from work and I discovered him bent over the table working pretty hard and making a lot of progress. He told me that I cannot leave a puzzle out and not expect and engineer to work on it. :) He loves puzzles and has done many over the years and in his opinion this one is well made. The individual shapes are well trimmed and click together well and do not get stuck or complicated in each other. The image is absolutely beautiful and while when I clicked to select a product for review I was going by the fact of the name Ravensburger, I did not even see the number of pieces or that it was of a dolphin at the time. After spending time with this puzzle I can tell you that for myself 500 pieces was just great. It was definitely not a one sitting puzzle, but it providing some stop and go entertainment for sure. The colors and image are really pretty, quite beautiful in fact and it would make a good framed puzzle if we were into doing that. There is lots of sea life that will be a great conversation or learning piece for someone studying ocean life.Quite honestly I have nothing negative to say about it as an amateur puzzle-worker and a homeschooling mama I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it or buy Ravensburger puzzles in the future. While before I only knew their youngest puzzles in 35 pieces, it seems that the quality holds true even to 500 and I wouldn't doubt beyond that.*Thanks to Amazon Vine for providing a sample for review.*"
0,1,"I love Ravensburger Puzzles. This one is no exception. The colors are fabulous and add a depth of dreaminess to this puzzle. Each piece fits perfectly into it the ones it is meant to interlock with.While the puzzle is a challenge, it isn't so much so that it loses its fun factor. The ages of everyone in the group working on the puzzle ranged from 10 to 57. A good time was had by all!Later on I put the puzzle together by myself and enjoyed it just as much."
0,1,"This is a beautiful puzzle.  I love the blue backing on the pieces --which makes them easier to find when they're dropped on the floor.  The pieces are small as one would expect.  I like the variety of colors in this picture.  My husband visited Neuschwanstein 10 years ago, so I thought he would enjoy this puzzle.  As soon as I saw these pieces, though, I have to admit that I realized that I prefer 500 piece puzzles at this stage in my life.  I have 3 children and I'm pretty busy.  I like to be able to sit down for a few minutes and find a piece or two that I can put in pretty quickly.  With a 1000 piece puzzle, that is hard to do.  It's a lot easier to feel successful at a 500 piece puzzle.  I think 500 pieces will probably be the largest that my children are able to tackle for several years as well.  There's a really big jump down in piece size from the 500 piece puzzles to the 1000 piece puzzles.  Still, this is a beautiful puzzle for adult puzzlers!"
0,1,"1000 Pieces!  What a way to spend your afternoons... for the next ten years!  Actually, I finished this puzzle in 4 days.  The pic is a breath taking vista and the pieces were perfectly cut, fitting the abutting pieces flawlessly.  Ravenburger is a company hat knows their stuff!  Everything I've seen from them so far is of the utmost highest quality material and build. They care and it shows in their products.  No frayed ends, no splitting.I'll never get my puzzles from anywhere else!"
0,1,"I'm not much into puzzles, but I've been wanting to try some decent ones for quite some time. Ever since reading Death Note and seeing Near's blank white puzzle, that's what I wanted to try. But I figured, ""Let's try something easier first. At least something with pictures."" So that's why I ordered this puzzle.It's got the image of the very familiar Neuschwanstein (or the ""Disney castle""), and the brilliant colors make the pieces a wee bit easier to find.But man, I didn't know the pieces would be so small! I realize it's to conserve table space and make the puzzle more challenging, but it's quite a shock for someone so new to puzzles, like me.It was a joy to build, though it probably took me longer than it would've others. I've already two more Ravensburger puzzles, and yes, one is blank!"
0,1,"These are good bubbles. not really any better than what you can buy at any local store. However I like to give this as part of gifts with bubble wands or whenever there is a bubble theme, simply because I find the aesthetic of the bottle to be a bit more...I dont know...European in feel and therefore somehow more special and unique. People really go for kids toys that are European in look and feel, even if its all a smokescreen."
0,1,This a a wonderful bubble mixture. The bubbles don't pop easily. They are large and sturdy. They stay aloft and are also very colorful.
0,1,"I am on a ""wooden toy"" kick and this is one of the items I purchased. There is a warning on the package stating that the eggs could pose a choking danger. They are in fact quite small. They are smaller than a real ""small"" egg you find in the grocery store, The package is realistic, just like you would purchase a 1/2 dozen eggs in the store. The label is a sticker and I can foresee this being removed either intentionally or unintentionally with general wear. I would definitely be carefully purchasing this toy for a younger child, choking is a very real potential hazard. I do not regret purchasing this toy and I would do it again just to complete my ""wooden toy sets"" however I do wish the eggs were in fact a little larger and maybe the label was painted or ink stamped like the real egg cartons in the grocery store."
0,1,"When I opened the package it had a weird scent like vinegar. My son likes the eggs but I thought they would be a little bit bigger so you really have to watch your child while he/she plays. They are smaller then a golf ball and about the size of a strawberry. So never leave your child alone. They are made of wood so are durable. Me and my son use them for his speech therapy which we focus on counting. He also used them to pretend play with a little pan we have for him so he liked that he was making ""eggs"""
0,1,The eggs are made of wood so they can be a little loud when stirred around in a pot. Other than that they are great. My daughter has cooked lots of eggs for everyone that comes over.
0,1,"Yes, you get one.  But as another reviewer mentioned that means that you can choose how many you want/need for your play kitchen. They are not tiny unless you are comparing them to Melissa and Doug, which in my opinion are WAY too big for children's play food, and lousy quality besides.  The potato is about 2 1/2 in long, and is actually much larger than most of Haba's wooden food.  I've yet to test any toy with a toilet paper tube, and rather just use my best judgement, but I think these may even pass that test. I received mine accidentally when a seller sent this item instead of the set of 5 fabric potatoes also by Haba.  I highly recommend those by the way if you are looking for a set of really nice varied and natural looking potatoes(you can read my review for them for more info). If you want a wooden potato, it seems as if this is your only option as I have yet to find a vegetable set from any company that includes them.  This potato is feels great to hold, is smooth and regular shaped, and has nice little dimpled ""eyes"" which adds a great and simple detail. It is colored with a slightly translucent dye which allows for some wood grain to show. No chipping paint on these!  As is the case with all Amazon items, this price varies day to day, so watch out. I think that if the price is kept at or under three dollars(I would not pay over that), buying a set of 3-5 of these would be totally reasonable.  It all depends on the price, but after all it's no big deal to hit the quantity button when ordering, right?  So if they are 3 bucks each, a set of five, high quality, German made hardwood food items for 15 dollars seems like a fair deal to me. I am happy to pay for safe, quality made toys...but that's my opinion."
0,1,"my boys love their tea whether it's real or pretend. that's what happens when half their family is english i guess! they have an extensive kitchen collection and when my oldest saw the tea bags online he was very excited about them. we got them recently and so far they've tangled a bit and the string has untied twice, but that's to be expected. overall they are great toys. simple yet perfect for pretend. also the big debate about the size worried me at first but when i got them they were perfect for the tea cups and the tin JUST fits the 4 bags. i think they're perfect. the boys are now even more insistent that they serve tea to all of our guests. it's hilarious."
0,1,"Bought this for my granddaughters for their ""kitchen set"".  It is VERY cute. They were sooo excited to open it up and see tiny little ""tea bags"". They ARE very cute! But a warning: they are VERY small! It comes with 4 ""teabags""; they are wooden-which is very nice (indestructable); they are in a tin-cute little tin; the tin is about 2"" x 1.5"" x 1.5"" and the ""teabags"" are about 1"" x 1/4"" or so.  Just a very rough estimate. I was shocked when I opened my ""VHS sized"" box from Amazon to find this tiny little tin of ""teabags"" for the price! Not sure they're worth that! But the girls do love them!"
1,0,We got this for our almost 1 year old for Christmas. He loves it! He even figured out how to set the ball on the top track right away.
0,1,"Highly recommend this game. I believe it starts at age six, however, my almost four son loves it. This is one of the few games that dad and I enjoy playing with him. Also, it's pretty quick, perfect for those times when you need an extra fifteen minutes"
0,1,"Most in-depth board games seem to be designed with 3 or more players in mind. Sure, you can play some of them with 2 players but the overall flow of the game really breaks down. My wife and I have defiitely noticed this and commented that while we have plenty of board games, we really can't pull most of them out and play a game together. On a quest to find good 2-player games I discovered Mr. Jack.  Mr. Jack is specifically designed to be played by two players and reminds me somewhat of a cat and mouse version of Clue.The premise of Mr. Jack is that one player is Jack the Ripper and the other player is a detective trying to track down the infamous fiend.  During the 8 rounds of gameplay (typically lasting less than 30 minutes) the detective is trying to determine which of the 8 in-game characters is Jack.  Meanwhile, Jack is trying to prevent himself (or herself) from being discovered and to escape the Whitechapel district where the murders took place. This cat and mouse gameplay allows for an engrossing and fun gameplay experience for two players that keeps you both on your toes. There is no deadtime between turns, as analyzing the moves your opponent makes could be key to accomplishing your goal.At the beginning of the game, the player portraying Jack randomly determines which of the 8 playable characters is Jack the Ripper. The gameplay takes place over 8 rounds while during each round players take turns moving 4 of the 8 playable characters, each character having their own unique abilities which can help or hinder the investigation.  Each character gets used once every other round so no characters are neglected. Both players get the chance to ""play"" all characters and alternate rounds as to whom gets first pick (1st player gets first choice, 2nd player gets next two choices, 1st player gets last choice). The characters are based on both real and fictional characters linked to the Jack the Ripper murders, including individuals like Sir William Gull and characters such as Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.To determine who the killer is, at the end of each round players will take note as to which characters' tokens are positioned either next to a street lamp, next to another character, or in the spotlight of one character's lantern. A character in one of these three positions is ""visible"". Only the Jack player knows which character is Jack, so Jack must tell the detective if Jack is in a position where he is visible or not, called in-game ""witnessed"" or ""unwitnessed."" This allows the detective to narrow down some suspects, as if Jack is witnessed, any character who is not visible can be declared innocent.The excitement of the game is in determining strategy as you play. Deciding how you want to position characters under your control, using the abilities of the characters you play, and deciding as Jack whether you want to simply remain anonymous for 8 rounds or attempt escape all factor into the gameplay. While the game might seem simple after just a game or two, my wife and I have both commented that as you continue to play you'll begin to notice how one wrong move can mess you up. You have to remain on your toes! I think luck factors into this game very little. Other than randomly determining whihc character is Jack and determining which 4 characters get chosen during a round (the other 4 will be played the next round) most of the game is purely about how you and your opponent play it.The gameboard and tokens are charming, caricatures of the characters portrayed. While the game deals with catching Jack the Ripper, the game features no blood or violence and in fact only refers to Jack as ""the Ripper"" once in the rules. It is more difficult to play as Jack (but more fun) so it might be best to take turns with each other. Some games end quickly, some games last the entire 8 rounds. If you're looking for a fun 2 player game with some nice strategy and depth but simple play mechanics, give Mr. Jack a try."
0,1,A necessity with the logger truck.  Three logs weren't enough for my guy.  He loves lifting the logs on and off the truck with the lifter.
0,1,These trash cans keep our grandson busy in his imaginary neighborhood where the trash collector is always hard at work.
0,1,My grandson received the truck as a gift from his aunt and uncle.  This is a great accessory set to it.  He loves to dump the garbage into the truck and then turn the gears to take it into the hopper.
1,0,"I purchased this little fellow in Prague after being given the Dragon for Christmas. It's a remarkably detailed piece, with an amazing level of historical accuracy in the armor and armaments of the 14th/15th century. It's made of highly durable plastic, and overall it's rugged enough to withstand the rigors of entertaining youngsters. I bought several other members of the Schleich Knights series for my two nephews, aged 4 and 6, so there is minimal concern that the detachable parts (his war hammer, basically) could be dangerous for young children. The pieces come in two opposing camps: the Red Fleur de Lis, and the Blue Lion, and each piece has a corresponding piece in the other, with somewhat different design and graphics. This reflects an impressive variety in styles of armament and armor of the period, and vastly improves the educational value of the series. The level of detail, for this price, is actually quite surprising. This piece is exceptional, and is one of the more beautiful to look at."
0,1,"Wonderful detail, excellent quality.  Purchased for an 8yo boy.  We are very pleased with this item. Will definitely be buying more Schleich in the future."
0,1,Got these for my baby boy. He bangs them and nests them and seems to like them a lot. I like how nice and sturdy they are.
0,1,"My 2.5-year-old daughter was spending a lot of time playing a cheap toy glockenspiel, so I decided to buy her one that was actually tuned.  This glockenspiel fits the bill!  Because it's tuned, its sound is very pleasant, even when struck at random.  The components all seem sturdy.  The mallets are plastic, but pretty tough plastic, and they work just fine.  We are all very happy with it."
0,1,"We have a nice collection of instruments for my kids.  I normally am okay with them making noise thinking they are learning about rhythm etc..  BUT this toy is ear peircing.  I make them go into a room by themselves and play it.  If they can restrain themselves and just lightly hit it the noise is okay.  Also, my kids (3 and 5 years) are able to take the metal pieces off."
0,1,"We're using this for a school band and it is, as advertised, a great instrument for younger children.  It's holding up well and the kids are enjoying playing it."
0,1,"If your kids have ever asked for music toys like they have at school, this one of the classics. You can whack it with the mallet and make a clicking sound or rub the mallet on the ridges for a different tone. Great addition and a great way to introduce your kids to rhythm."
0,1,"Fantastic little bell. Our twin one year old grandchildren immediately gravitated to the bell, which is the perfect size for them to play. They were easily able to ring the bell... Makes loud enough pleasant sound. The only problem is only one bell for two kids.  Guess they will share and use other music makers for their band."
0,1,We bought this for my daughter at 6 months.  She loves to chew on the handle and shake it around.  The bell sound is pleasant (and I am easily annoyed by sounds).  Only 4 stars due to the steep price.
1,0,"This was the absolute favorite Christmas present - he figured out how to ring it and it made a LOT of noise for the effort.  The noise was not tinny and annoying (okay, maybe on a long car ride it would get to that point).  The bell tone was decently tuneful to not grate.The bell is heavy for the little one but still manageable... and I figure the extra arm strength will help with crawling shortly :).Hohner is a great brand for quality musical instruments for the very young.  They take care to make them musical rather than just tinny/plasticky.  The brightly colored instruments get kids interested but the quality of the sound really makes their instruments heads above the other brands because it helps to develop an appreciation for music as well."
1,0,My 8 month old granddaughter knew what to do with this immediately and when she started shaking the bell she broke out in a big smile.  It is one of her favorite items to play with and the noise is not annoying at all.
0,1,My 1 year old loves this bell.  I love that the bell can't be crushed or broken no matter how rough the play.
0,1,"Not much to say- I needed a set for my multimeter, and these did the trick.  They've held up nicely with no problems."
0,1,"We use it in our business to test LED bulbs to insure the diodes work before shipping them to customers, it works well with our tester. The cable is a good length and seems to stand up to some abuse."
0,1,"Although the adjustable height and reclining features seem nice, in reality I have used them only once or twice.  The main problem with this high chair is that the food goes everywhere but the tray.  The tray doesn't go in far enough (despite having ""4 positions""), so there is a large gap between baby and tray where food goes.  Food also goes between the cloth pad and the plastic chair, all over the buckle, on the main tray (instead of the removeable tray), etc.  It's sometimes nice to have a removeable tray, but when food gets all over the main tray, there's no point.Buy a simpler high chair with less ""features"" you will never use."
0,1,"i got this for a birthday game. when reading about this pool, it shows a picture of a pool with stars on it. they also show a picture with circles on the pool. the discription says "" star kiddies (which could mean the brand is star kiddies or that its the pool with stars) 2 ring circles (which could mean the shape of the pool is a circle or that it has circles on the pool) swimming pool"" i didnt find a review that answered my question of which it was. i prefered the stars but would settle for circles since my bday party is an underwater clifford party.much to my delight it was the star one we recieved. very happy with it. it does have a smell out of the package but not entirely unpleasant, the bottom blow valve lets air out before you can plug it. the top one didnt do this. the pool isnt quit round when blown up, this may be because air escaped while capping bottom plug.over all pleased with product for price. wish they were a little more clear on what you were getting.also, the last two kiddy pools ive gotten are covered in warnings. i suppose letting people know their child could drown is good, but it completely takes from any design on the pool when every part of the pool, inside and out has words on it. no i dont want my kids to drown, writting isnt what prevents that though, and its not being used as a pool anyway. this one doesnt have warning triangles though, which is nice. also, the pool says for ages 3and up. i wouldnt think a child of 4 1/2 would enjoy this much."
0,1,This is a great toy and keep up the search for the princesses!  I did eventually find all of them but you have to keep searching.  Thanks to other reviews I went to Kohls and found Jasmine and Ariel.  I had to go to another Kohls in a diffent town to find Snow White but I did get them all.  Kohls is your best bet for the princesses.
1,0,We really like these tub toys and they hold up well to our 3 young children.  They usually last about 12-18 months if you store them in a toy shower bag.  The seals will eventually wear away and make them unusable.  Sounds good and kids love them.
0,1,These tub drums are great!  My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves them.  She got them for Christmas and they entertain her in the tub for at least 30 minutes.  She plays her own little tunes and makes up songs while she is in there.  She is very musically inclined and loves playing the drums.  I think this is a bath toy that will last a long time!
0,1,I bought two sets of these for my granddaughters for Christmas. One is 7 and loves to play drums with anything around. The other is 2 and also loves banging on things. I hope they don't drive their parents crazy!
0,1,Gave this to my 18 month nephew.  Him and his 3 year old brother really love it and have LOTS of fun playing with it in and OUT of the tub!  It's a nice quality piece and am happy with it.
1,0,Both my kids love this toy so much. Yeah some of the things fall off (some of them are meant to). The only thing that they dont like is when the slide falls off but it snaps right back on. They are 32 months and 20 months (2 1/2 and 1 1/2) and this is one of the few toys that keeps their attention for more than a few minutes. Most toys they will play with for the first couple days and then maybe a few minutes every now and then but not this one. I have no clue what it is. To me this looked like a silly toy with no point but they loved it so much I bought them the Weebles farm too! And they like it too. Maybe a little too much..they want to play with them instead of going to sleep!
0,1,"this is a great tool for my 9 year old in continuing her math foundation, she does enjoy it in her spare time when she has nothing else to do, not just when i tell her to practice her math facts."
0,1,I purchased this product because my daughter was getting bored with the traditional flashcards. The Flashmaster has helped increase her speed and accuracy.  Her teacher has also noticed how much she has improved...I have her practice daily on the Flashmaster after she finishes homework.
0,1,"Got this for our 4 yr old grandson. It's easy to hold and makes cool sounds as he tips it one way then another. Watching the little balls move back and forth really mesmerizes him. The little stick, for using it as a regular drum, will probably be lost in a week or so; it comes off too easily- not an issue for me though as he didn't seem to want to use it that way anyway."
0,1,"We debated buying 'real' bongos for a while, but decided that we couldn't go wrong with $20 Remo bongos for our 15 month old daughter. I'm so glad we didn't overspend, because these are perfect! They have some of these at her daycare, and they are easy for babies to use, solid but not dangerously heavy, and make a satisfyingly loud sound.These are very high quality, solid, and beautiful. They work well and make a great drummy sound. They are pretty large, too, relative to children themselves. Overall, a great and reasonable purchase."
0,1,"My kids had a bit of fun with this.  This splash guard mostly containded the mess, which is good.It was kind of difficult for my kids (6 and 8) to squeeze out only a few drops at a time so a fair amount of the paint ended up spinning right off the paper and wasted in the tray.  But there was still plenty of paint to fill the cards that it came with.  It came with some white papers and some black.  This seemed like a good idea.  The colors barely showed up on the black paper though and even the white ones where not nearly as bright as in the picture."
0,1,GREAT FUN TOY.. GREAT GRANDAUGHTER LOVED IT . AND IMMEADIATELY WOULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.IT ARRIVED IN GREAT SHAPE AND RECORD TIME.. EVERYTHING WORKED AND WAS INTACT. I KNOW IT WILL PROVIDE HOURS OF FUN AND EDUCATION FOR MY 18 MO. OLD GREAT GRANDAUGHTER.
1,0,"My 3 year old LOVES this toy.  I had no idea how this thing was going to work when we got it, but it is really ingenious.  It gives short simple directions that my son can follow to find letters to build and sound out words.  Even how to find rhyming words.  Very cool!  I was pleasantly surprised that my son was so interested it, and that he could follow the directions rather than just put in random letters.  The toy does do a fair amount of ""coaching"" when it senses no letters are being placed, which is a help.Sometimes, as with all technology of this nature the words they say can be hard to understand, when they say ""spell hat"" sometimes you may think they said ""bat"" or ""rat"" until they actually say ""H - A - T"" and spell it out.  But that isn't just a problem with leapfrog.  This doesn't seem to bother my son as much as it does me though!"
0,1,"UPDATE 5/16/2011My review of Fridge Words haven't changed, as it's still working great.  My problem, however, is if you ever lose a letter.  We recently lost the ""f"", and Leapfrog won't replace it.  According to their website, they can't replace the letter and there's pretty much nothing I can do about it.  This is not a huge problem, however my kids did notice the letter missing...*sigh*.  So, spelling words like ""fox"", ""fun"", and ""far"" is temporarily hindered.  I'm not about to go buying a new set, and have scoured eBay for the replacement - most resellers sell individual letter for about $2 each, not including shipping.  That said - watch out for those lost letters!!!!-------------------------------We purchased the Leapfrog Fridge Words Magnetic Word Builder in 2008 for our son for Christmas.  It's now 2010, the toy is still working great, and now our 1 1/2 year old daughter is playing with it, too!  There are a lot of appealing features about this toy for our kids; the little music notes button sings the full ABC song, the letters are easy to put into the slots, and music and voices on the toy are fun for the kids to listen to.  Our daughter likes to push the music button and sing and dance along with the song.  Our son who is now almost 3 is just starting to understand to put the correct letter into the slot when playing the spelling mode.  There are three modes to this toy - listening to letter when putting it into any slot, spelling any three letter word, and spelling a three letter word that is specified.We do have a few gripes about this toy, particularly with the sound quality of the toy.  Some words are just flat out hard to understand.  I've had to listen to some of the words twice to decipher whether the word given was lap or pat or whatever.  I can only imagine how hard it is for our kids to decipher!  It would also be nice to have the modes switch placed somewhere else on the toy.  Our kids like to switch up modes - usually to a harder mode that they can't figure out yet - and treats the switch as a plaything!  While this is nice to encourage play, I would rather have our kids focus on playing and learning the letters/phonetics instead of switching to a mode where they hear ""beep beep!  whoops, let's try another one!"" all the time.Outside of those gripes, the toy is well made, educational, and our kids like playing with it.  Recommended!"
0,1,"After my 2-yr-old stopped paying much attention to his first LeapFrog Fridge game that just let you put in one letter, he was really happy to start playing with the word whammer.  He immediately started spelling ""Mom"" and ""Dad"", then ""Nap"" when he was tired and ""Sad"" when he was mad about not getting a cookie.  I'm amazed everytime he spells a new word."
0,1,This is definite must have for your childs Dora Talking Dollhouse.My children have fun setting the pieces exactly where they think they should go. We have had the dollhouse & other accessories for almost a year and all is in like new condition.It's played with almost on a daily basis.The price was right & I am pleased with all of the Dora products I purchased here.They ship fast & items were securely packed.[...].
0,1,"Theme based around history which is greatEasy to learn, hard to master.Lots of different missions to play right out of the boxVery tactical game.Plays smoothTakes a bit to set up and tear down but the game out weighs the annoyance."
1,0,I own quite a few board games now and this is not only in my top 10 games but #1 in that list.  It only took me 5 minutes to teach my wife how to play  so its simple yet full of strategy.  It has a lot of scenarios based on WWII battle-s and they did a fantastic job.  One of the scenarios the Allied get a airdrop of paratroopers and the game has you hold a group of them 12&#34; above the middle of the board and drop them.  They stay where they land even if behind enemy lines!  There are so many expansions to this game so I see this being played for a long time to come.  My wife and I stick to one side and will start the scenarios over again switching sides as it is completely different.  We love this game and you will too!
0,1,"I bought this for my 13 year-old son and we play it all the time.  Best of all, it doesn't require 20 hours of setup or 934 complicated rules -- it's just complex enough to be fun -- but not so complex that you need to set aside a whole day.  You can actually say, ""Hey--want to play Memoir '44?"" spontaneously.  I recall trying to slog through Squad Leader as a kid but giving up -- this is the game I wish I had.  There are many scenarios so it never gets old and the pieces are durable and fun to handle.  Worth every penny.  They really did a fine job with this one."
0,1,"Fun WWII themed board game. The board setup, turn order and hand limits are all based on the scenario that you chose to play. Movement is driven by maneuver cards and combat is dice driven with some modifiers for terrain. Game play takes about 30 to 45 minutes per round, once you know the rules. Players are supposed to switch sides for the second round so that each person player the Allies and the Axis.I gave it high marks for education because the scenarios are based on actual battles. Each scenario has a quick, but accurate, summary of what lead up to this battle in the war and what each side was trying to do. If you are a historian you may find a 2 paragraph summary of WWII somewhat lacking, but this is a board game so it gets 5 stars.Bottom line my kids like playing it. And I like playing it with them. And the summaries of the battles have lead to some good questions from my 11 year old.One thing to note, since movement is card driven hand management is very important. This can be frustrating to younger players. My 9 year old was somewhat irritated at first that he couldn't move whatever he wanted, but after a couple of games he got the idea.The components are nice. The miniatures are small but well detailed. The board is heavy and durable. The cards are really thick and laminated. This game will last for thousands of plays.OK, so buy the game."
0,1,"I'm not a wargamer, partly because I never got the opportunity.  I might have been when I was teenager, because I was enthralled with learning about the military and playing military style computer games along with other types of games.  I was however never big into playing with plastic army men.  Seems like plastic army men were begging for a game to be made for them and Memoir '44 does that very well.  I've heard about how long most wargames take (3,4,5,6,..10+ hrs), and at this stage of my life with job, kids, and church, I don't have the time to play. Memoir '44 really fits that niche for me with the kind of wargame that I am looking for, because it can easily be played in about an hour.  The base game provides plenty of replay value and challenge as each person can try their hand playing each side.Some people complain about too much luck, and I understand that isn't to some people's tastes.  I however enjoy the luck factor, because it adds uncertainty that happens in real life.  This leads to some neat ""heroics"" where the last infantry takes out that tank and causes cheers and groans on either side. Again, the whole point of good luck based games is to give you options to minimize your opponents luck factor and maximize yours.  Memoir '44 does this very well by the use of terrain which is expected in a tactical style wargame.  Effective use of terrain will help you win the game.The command cards are a nice way to simulate the ebb and flow of the overall battle.  The cards add some nice offensive power to the game that simulates some possible real life situations that happen on the battlefield.  Cards such as ""Their Finest Hour"" that represents those moments when troops rally to the cause and ""Behind Enemy Lines"" where a squad is able to penetrate deep behind the enemy to wreck some havoc.Memoir '44 does have educational value by recreating famous battles of WWII.  Each mission provides some history from the war.  It also gives me as a father time to explain to my children what WWII was about, so they will one day learn the amazing sacrifice out country paid for our freedom.One thing the base game lacks is the variety of air planes, campaigns, and other forces to really recreate some interesting battles.  However, that's where the expansions come into play, and maybe one day I'll be able to purchase more as my pocket book allows.All in all, I truly enjoy ""fun"" factor that Memoir '44 provides, and so does my 7yr old daughter and 5 yr old son."
0,1,"I was looking for a new favorite game to play, learned of Pirate's Cove, tracked down a copy on ebay, and indeed, found a new favorite game.The goal is to become the most infamous pirate in the land, achieved by burying treasure and winning battles. And it's the battles where the game really shines. You build up your ship, you head out to plunder islands, and if you happen to find yourself at the same location as another pirate, you have no choice but to do battle.The battles almost feel like an accelerated game of Risk. With Risk, when you attack a country, you know you've got armies all over the place to survive at least another round or two. With Pirate's Cove, your ship is all you've got, and you'll be rolling dice like a mad man to stay afloat.Is this game worth tracking down and overpaying for? In my opinion, absolutely. I think the going rate on ebay is around $60, $70 with shipping ($114 on Amazon is steep, I'd wait it out), which is pricey. But it's worth it, best of all, because everyone I have introduced this to has fallen in love with it on the first game. Unlike other games, that take a burgeoning interest to really embrace, Pirate's Cove is the sort of game where friends who are absolutely not into gaming keep asking me when we're going to play again.The rule book is a little thick, but it's almost like they went out of their way to spell out each and every little step so there would be no questions, and it's ultimately very airtight. Read it a couple times, then gather some pirates and set a-plundering."
0,1,"I really don't think that you can go wrong with a Nerf gun!  With this particular model, I really liked the smaller size.  It is quick to load and fire and is simple enough for young children to use.  (My four and 6 year olds play with this and love it!)  I mistakenly thought that I could escape being attacked with this model, but as a mom I should have known better!  This model works great around the house and in the backyard.  More serious players (older children & adults) would probably prefer a larger model - perhaps one that can feed more darts.  However, I really prefer the simplicity of this Nerf gun!  I rated 4/5 stars on durability because some of the darts inevitably get torn or damaged after many firings.  I would recommend buying an additional pack of darts to have on hand if you do not already have extras at home."
0,1,We got it for our kids for Christmas. The best part of this is it's still working. The battery powered ones do not work anymore but this one is manual. Just be prepared to buy more ammo as they will lose it.
0,1,I love Nerf guns.  They're incredibly fun!  While the bigger ones are great the smaller ones like this N-Strike Maverick are easier to conceal from your enemies so they'll never see your attack coming!  So load and destroy your target!

0,1,Reply value of this game is off the charts and you will laugh for hours working through the dangers of misfortune in search of the magic carrot. I cannot recommend this game enough. Perfect for a generational gap game!
0,1,"I got this game for my birthday from my brother, who has a slightly twisted sense of humor.  Since the ""twisted humor gene"" runs in my family, I was more than happy to give it a try.The directions are long, but the authors take into account the fact that most of us are not rocket scientists.  They take you through everything step by step so when you play that first hand you're ready.  I suggest you consider your first game a ""practice game"" because you'll probably have a few questions and you will need to refer to the instructions.  But once you've played once or twice this game is very fast-paced and competitive.My teenage daughters and I have been playing it every night and we love it.  We all have our favorite carrots (mine is ""Dex"" the nerd!)  and we feel absolutely no guilt about killing innocent bunnies.Of course this game isn't for everybody, and I understand that someone who is sensitive to the extermination of innocent bunnies may have a bone to pick with me.  But really... how can you not laugh at weapons like lime green jello?It's all in fun and no actual bunnies get harmed.  And the end of the game is a cool combination of luck and chance (we do it like an ""American Idol"" show... ""And the ultimate Carrot Idol is..."")All in all, this is a great family game.  The kids will need to know how to read well in order to play, and they will need to understand that killing rabbits is not really an appropriate activity.  If your children (or adults!) can do that, it's all good."
0,1,I got this for my almost three year old daughter for Christmas. I wanted a cute little wooden doll cradle for her. She loved it! It's the perfect size. It is very sturdy and easy to put together. It even came with the purple blanket and pillow you see pictured. This will be a cradle that will last for a while.
0,1,This is a beautifully constructed cradle - comes with a pillow and blanket and comforter and is easy to put together.  It rocks really nicely too.  Got this for my daughter for her first doll bed and she rocks it all the time - easy for her 15 month old hands to do.  Would definitely recommend - great deal for the price!
1,0,"While the price may be a little higher than I wanted to pay for a kitchen set, I've got to say that it's worth every penny!  It's nice enough that we feel good about having it in our entertainment room...which I wouldn't do with one of the plastic sets.  It's definitely sturdy...we find our 2 year old daughter standing on the counter top way too frequently.  It's a big hit with all the kids when they're over at our house.  If your on the edge, buy this one over any of the others."
0,1,"My grandson (age 3) has several Thomas and friends locomotives. I wanted some rolling stock for Thomas to pull behind.

0,1,"This toy seems to be well made, and my great grandson is enjoying it a lot.  Nice size and weight."
1,0,"We had previously bought the 'special edition' version of this CD player and it pooped out on us immediately.  We took a chance (because the 3 yr old who it was for INSISTED we try again) and it works well!  She can operate it without any problem.  I would like it if she couldn't put it on 'pause' and then just leave it to wear out the battery, but it's a hit!"
1,0,"My sons, 3 and 4, just love these tubes, especially since it was combined with the Saxoflute set.  They like to make things using the mouthpieces the best!  I highly recommend also purchasing the Saxoflute set if you are going to buy this one.  My sons have created some incredibly imaginative things using these tubes!!The Saxoflute is definitely a ""noisy"" toy, but the kids love it so I put up with the noise!!"
0,1,"All my kids, and even the adults, enjoyed this game.  My only complaint is there were too few pieces in this set, and I wish they provided cards with different designs so my younger kids can try to figure those out.  Still, we've had this for over a year, and once in a while, the kids still bring them out to play."
0,1,"This is a great little guitar for kids. I bought it for my 1 year old after he showed interest in my guitar. This one is small and light so my baby can easily lift it. The strings are soft nylon so I do not have to worry about him cutting his fingers. I have played it and it produces ""okay"" sound. My baby just likes to bang on it but you can have a 7-10 year old learn real chords on this guitar."
0,1,"Looks pretty darn cute - but just a piece of junk. The track does not stay together at all - even when pieces are properly assembled and snapped together. My kids gave up on it after a day, lost interest in it not staying together. Plus, I think they found it boring. Okay, push the car down the roller coaster. Yeah, then what? The ferris wheel they had zilch interest in also. My pony loving girls seem to have found this to be boring. My son is the only one who has played with it - just the ponies and the car to push along on the carpet. that's it.I picked this up on clearance for less than $5 - and really, that's about how much it's worth in my opinion.We have the castle, and while that fall apart, too, the kids still like that - how the castle comes apart doesn't ruin their play with it - but this, what fun is a roller coaster when the track doesn't stay together? And isn't something my girls can put back together themselves.I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you find it super marked down on clearance, and only then if your child is really into ponies."
0,1,"My daughter received this as a christmas gift this past year, and while at first she ignored it, after interacting with her, showing her the blocks, where they fit into the box, she loves it! Every time she gets one in, (sometimes mommy helps) she grins and claps! I tell her the colors, and shapes, and I think this toy will really help her identify shapes and colors, even objects. I'm a fan of the Peek-a-block line, for the most part well designed, and to use a totally overworked phrase, really educational."
0,1,"I got this toy for my son for Easter and he loves everything about it.  He loved pushing on the top of the castle and hearing the music play.  It comes with a lot of little people figures and creatures like a horse and dragon.  The draw bridge is also a lot of fun!  Don't pay the 80 that amazon is chraging, it's only 30-40 at toys r us or walmart."
0,1,"As a standalone toy, the Coastal Winds Airport is alright.  Its neat that the tower offers multiple vehicle sounds.  Its also interesting that the 'flying arm' is modular and appears to be ready to support additional planes and helicopters beyond the original.The thing is, it doesn't really integrate with the rest of the Geotrax system.  The road vehicles and the train vehicles can connect to one another and even drive on each other's tracks.  The airport really doesn't have any way of connecting to the rest of the layout and just sort of 'sits next to' the rest of your Geotrax setup.  So, as I said, its not a bad toy, it just doesn't have the WOW factor that many of the other Geotrax units do."
0,1,"My 3 year old wanted this toy after seeing it in the store. (She liked the little mole that would pop up and say ""Peek-a-Boo!"") I didn't think it would hold her attention for very long, but because I also have a 5 month old that can ""grow into it"", I went ahead and got it. At first, I was really disappointed. It seemed that it didn't do much. Actually, though, after playing with it more with my kids, it's okay, although I definitely think there are better toys out there for your money (more ""bang"" for your buck, as the saying goes). My daughter likes to pull the tape measure and hear it sing the ABC song, but the lyrics to the other song just go on about what this toy can ""teach"". It is really quite a dumb song, in my opinion. It's to the same tune as a song on the Learning Home, only with different words. The one on the Learning Home is better (although it's not my favorite either). The music and sounds that go with the other parts of the toy are great--upbeat and fun. I like how it counts as you pound the shapes, and if you stop pounding before 10, it will play a cute, short little melody. It's nice that you don't really have to ""pound"" either... a gentle press of the shape is all it takes, which will be good for my little one. The slider button names the shape and it's color as you slide it below the shape, but it's pretty hard to slide. My 3 year old can do it fine, but I think even a 1 year old might find it a bit hard to do on their own. The down side to this toy is that it is very HEAVY. It'd also be nice if the tape measure played more than just two songs. I was right about it not holding my 3-year old's interest for long (2-3 minutes is all in one sitting).  We'll see how it goes with my 5 month old as she gets a little older."
0,1,"My kids always loved those machines at the grocerystore and love all the things that can come out of them, so we bought this for them while they play grocery store and for my younger ones to have fun with, (6 1/2 month old twin boys and 3 y.o twin b/g at the time)You put about 4-6 peek-a-rounds in WIDE top so your little ones hands can easily fit without poseing a hazzard (hard candy, ring, teddy bear, and a lolly-pop come with them, some of them also make a little rattle when you shake them, and added bonus) and then push the blue lever to get one out, (randomly) and while they roll through the swirly slide in the clear dome shaped base (clear so you can see them go through) it plays a cute little song and some lights flash. If you dont want the music (its not too annoying but just if you dont want it) you can still play without batteries and the lever still makes them come out. It ends up at the base and you just put them in again. We have not had a huge problem with it falling over,all toys do, but I really wouldnt recomend this for pulling up.The yellow handle is one of my now 8 month old boys favorites because it makes one of those cranking noises, its not hollow, maybe they fixed it? But my 3 year olds LOVE guessing what will come out and seeing if their right! (surprize aspect like the ""real gumball machine!). The little face on the top is also very cute. We all love it and its also great for pretend ""grocery store"" play! It teaches cause and effect and has a little imagination to it!You can also buy more peek-a-rounds (or roll-a-rounds) which add more fun and also as backup incase you loose some!"
0,1,"My older daughter had this toy and absolutely loved it as a baby, so I just HAD to buy it again for our 5-month-old!  She loves pressing the lever and watching the ball come out of the bottom!  She does knock it over occasionally when she's sitting up next to it, but it's not a bother to pick the gumball machine back up each time because I'm usually sitting on the floor with her.  She enjoys the music and pressing the lever over and over, the toy is fun and educational.  When she's trying to flip over during a diaper change, I set this next to her and she'll reach up to pull the lever, so it makes diaper changes easier, too!If you're reading the reviews and debating on whether to buy it or not, definitely buy it!  This is a MUST HAVE toy for all babies!"
0,1,"My kids love this toy.  The music and lights aren't too annoying, and it teaches cause and effect.  It's also cute and durable."
0,1,"My neice and my son each have one and they both love it.. as does my four year old! they are so cute.. this is the first toy that my son actually played with! It is very cute. If I had not gotten it as a gift, I would buy it! Great toy.."
0,1,This item was order in November and did not arrive until very near Christmas.  Be sure to allow sufficient delivery time. We ordered two. One of them needed to be re-glued in order  to work properly; but that was  a minor fix.  The teenage boys who received them approached them differently - One just broke it pried off the top cover; the other was determined to open the box correctly.  Both had fun with them.
1,0,"If your child or students are at the age where they are learning the states and capitals, this is a great game to teach them.  Because so much of the USA is landlocked, this game is very challenging.  The driving tiles make it a fun variation in travel.  A great family strategy game.  We play the swap rule with the kids to speed up play."
1,0,"I have played both this game and the 10 Days of Africa game.  I highly recommend this series of games by Out of the Box.  It does a great job of helping kids (even me & my wife) learn geography!  I was pretty smart kid in school, and still remember a lot from my geography class. However, we never studied African Geography, and I learned a lot in the times we played with my daughter.  This game is great because it's quick enough to where you can get a lot of games in one sitting.  The more you play the more you learn.  Visual learners will be add an advantage here, because they'll pick it up quicker.  It does encourage critical thinking and hand/route optimization.  I like the USA addition better, because it's a little more challenging with they way the did Alaska and Hawaii.Alan Moon is a genius! Check out his Ticket to Ride games too!"
1,0,"My boy likes this truck, just enough motion to make it interesting, Wish it was easier to find a car it could actually tow, but that is my curiosity and not yet something my son cares about."
1,0,The seller sent the product quickly. So far we have used 200 of the bracelets and not a single one has been a dud!! We used them for a bonfire and for the 4th of July. There has only been a few of the aqua/teal colored ones found so far but they are SO pretty. I will buy from this seller again. In the past I have bought glow sticks from other sellers on Amazon but have always had dud's (with one seller over half were bad). These are the only ones I will buy in the future.
0,1,"These glow for a very, very long time. This was an excellent buy. We are just a family, but we go through a lot of &#34;glow parties&#34; - throwing them around the yard at night, hanging big loops of them in trees, making creepy things, etc. They tend to break pretty easy, so try to keep them in the container or you'll find you've lost some of them to time, or you'll get glowing goo everywhere. (Okay, well, painting with goo and making your arms glow is sorta fun, but probably not the best idea.)"
0,1,Do not buy this item. We had it one day and inflated it to the exact directions and it literally lasted less the one hour. Mind you my daughter weighs in at 28lbs. And boom it burst and on the floor she went. Junk
0,1,Bought this for my daughter and I have seen balloons bigger than this thing.  It's so small any kid small enough to actually bounce on it probably isn't old enough to bounce in the first place.  It's already been tossed.
0,1,"this is a memory from when my kids were small and now the grand babys can enjoy it too, it will be geat."
1,0,My 8-year old granddaughter requested this for her birthday.  She LOVES Legos and has the City collection well in hand.  She enjoyed putting the fire truck together and has added it to her growing collection.  Now on to the bigger ones!!!
0,1,"We love rocket balloons! My kids absolutely love these. I had used rocket balloons before, but this set is great because of the pump that is included. No more feeling like I am about to pass out from blowing up all the balloons! These are great for groups of kids because they can all watch the balloon whiz around through the air and run after the deflated balloon when it falls. We just ordered multiple sets to have them on hand to give as birthday gifts."
0,1,This balloon makes noise when we blow and leave it.My nephew loved it and she was 4 years old.I tried this in front of my 9 months old son and he started crying by hearing the loud noise
1,0,"I had been searching for the 'right' playhouse to put out in our backyard.  I wanted it to be big enough for my five year old son and not too 'girlie' while also being fun for my two year old daughter.  We went to Toys R Us to check them out and this one was on display outside the store. Both of my children took to it immediately.  It is not as big as that Welcome Home one for $499, but my son, who is average size, fits in it just fine and it really has a lot to offer (not to mention it is half the price).  In addition to all that you see on the outside, the inside is filled with textured plastic in the shape of tools on the gas station wall, food and a surveillance camera on the grocery store side, a bookshelf on the school side, etc.  It's really very cute.  Putting it together was fairly simple, except for the gas pump.  The inside of the hole it is supposed to snap into was covered by a 'drip' of extra plastic that was not properly cut away during molding/construction.  We had to open up the hole a little bit using a knife so the hose could snap in.  Like others, I also would say that a power screwdriver is a necessity, especially when putting the soccer net on."
1,0,"We have been looking around for a playhouse for our 2 1/2 year old son and were about to buy the Naturally Playful Cottage by Step 2 until we saw this one.  This playhouse has so many more features, especially for little boys, and was considerably cheaper.  I am so glad we got this one.  This is the first one I've seen that gives more options for boys instead of just playing ""house.""  There is the schoolhouse/firehouse, gas station, grocery store, and sports walls.  The first thing my son did when we set it up was gas up his jeep.  I can see him playing with this one a lot longer that others because of all the options.  It was fairly easy to put together but you do need 2 people to secure the roof.  For the money, this is definitely the best value out there."
0,1,"This doll is so sweet and adorable! It has the face of angel and is so huggable. Cloe was my faveorite Bratz and now, she is my faveorite Bratz Baby!! However, she kinda looks like a slut."
1,0,Great classic toy; nice compact size. The only thing I would change is the top red piece--it doesn't stay on. I wish it had better threads in it and would screw on.
0,1,"This set of stacking rings are well made, but i have two problems with it:1> they are WAY too small for my 1 year old son. I can't imagine they are fun for 2 year olds... all he wants to do is to throw them down the steps. They rings & the poles are simply too small to grab his attention.I got another big plastic sets and he like that so much more.2> The top round-shaped ball does not screw in, so it's impossible to keep the set together when you have a very active toddler."
1,0,"Spy Alley is a secretive game that requires you to keep the other person constantly guessing who you are.  I like this game because I like being a spy, and I like tricking people.  It you can get other players to think you're someone you aren't, you have an advantage to winning.  Kids should play this game now because it is so fun! - Ben"
0,1,"It's official, today my little girl will turn four.  With that in mind, you can imagine how excited she was to finally get the ""Barbie"" Elina Doll with light-up wings.I hate to say it, but as a male adult who is almost thirty, I even find this doll to be pretty cool.  First of all, the doll's wings light up via the use of fiber optic lighting much like that found on miniature Christmas trees.  By pressing a button on her back, her wings flicker to life.  She also comes with a little blue guy.  I don't know his name, but I'm sure he's in the ""Fairytopia"" movie.  We have that as well, but I haven't watched it yet.Here's where I really get embarassed.  This doll has some really cool boots that look to be made out of vines.  They go all the way up to Elina's knees.  She also has flowers ""tattooed"" all over her arms and legs.In short, this is a really colorful doll that I'm sure any young girl(and some of us older dudes, too) would really enjoy.  It's a sure hit with your young ones!"
0,1,"I have always wanted Elina,and here`s my chance!She is only $7.50.THATS CHEAP!!She is adorable too!I have all the Barbie Princesses and MOST oF the movies.Unlike the mermaidia mermaids,I would suggest not to but her in the bath tub.If you look at the closup of her face,it`s so cute!She looks GORGEOUS!!!I mean,really,REALLY pretty~It`s amnazind how they did her beautiful face!GOOD WORK MATTEL!!!"
0,1,"We've had this for 1 year, the wings still light up.  The hair doesn't get messy, because it is very well styled. It has the most beautiful glitters in the hair that are just glittery strands, and they are better than the Winx doll strands, because they are shinier.  The doll's makeup is perfect and the boots fit her well.  I recommend it for a 6+ child, who would treat it with care it deserves.  My kids play rough, but no attempts have been made yet to take the hairbands out, maybe it's difficult, I'm glad, because the doll is pretty the way it is. Worth the money, one of a kind doll, extremely pretty."
0,1,"From the moment I heard that this was coming out I knew I would have to have one. The combination of two great toy brands, Star Wars and Mr. Potato Head. Little did I realize that this would become such a hot item. It was months of endless searching through store after store before I stumbled across one. And when I finally found them I wasted no time in snatching one up. Now I am a collector but I did not hesitate to open the package and put Darth Tater together. This is one of those Star Wars items that is meant to be opened and displayed proudly. Even though I am 30 I have no problems with displaying this item proudly on my desk for all to see. In fact I have had many people come by just to look at it and ask where I got it from. This has become a great conversation piece and I am not surprised. How could you not love Darth Tater?! And in the future I look forward to purchasing one the recently announced Spud Troopers to display next to Darth Tater."
0,1,I have always loved Mr. Potato Head and have acquired quite a number of potato head pieces. This one I like for what it is. It looks nice and is built well. If you are a collector then this is a must have. I only wish they would have made some different shoes for him. He comes with the same shoes as a regular potato head except they're black. The rest of the pieces are very nicely designed. He also comes with a few extra pieces so you can change his face around with just what comes in the box. It isn't perfect but it would make any potato head or star wars fan happy I'm sure.
0,1,"This three headed doggie is neat. I kind of like the Safari Ltd. version better, however, but bought this one first. The Safari Ltd. Cerberus has wolf like heads, which I prefer. Still, this Cerberus is nice."
1,0,This toy is very well made and durable.  It has been played with a lot and was a great addition to the collection.
0,1,"My husband and I just purchased this playset for our sons 4th birthday.  My little boy saw it at Toys R Us and really wanted it.  I came home and read some reviews about the Matchbox Hero City playsets and this playset and decided this would be a great gift for my son.  My little boy has'nt recieved this yet as its for his birthday but I took it out of the box to see what it did and what it looked like, it is well built and came with a huge free playmat!  I got it on sale for $14.99 and the best part about it is that there is'nt tons of pieces to put together, that means less time putting pieces together and more time enjoying the playset!  I have previously bought those race track sets and within a few days the pieces were missing and we all got tired of putting the track back together.  Thank you Matchbox for making something that is already put together, that has sounds and is realistic for a little boy to play with!I also purchased the Haunted House to go along with this playset.  I lucked up and happened to find at my Toys R Us a few of  the Matchbox Hero City playsets of the Jetport and car wash but I decided to wait on them and luckily I did because I found on Ebay  all 7 Hero City playsets for only $20.00!  That is why I am writing this review now incase anyone has been looking for the hero city playsets. They have several different sets on ebay for purchase so if someone is looking for these particular sets look on Ebay they have them.  I purchased them as well to go along with this playset.  Matchbox must have decided to quit making the 7 Hero city playsets, they are all really a nice addition to these other playsets and perfect to build together on the playmat to make a ""hero city"" of your own.  The 7 playsets I found on ebay were, The Jetport, carwash, construction site, garage, police station, fire station and heliport.  They all snap together to make one big track and go along with the buried treasure playset.  There is a picture of all of the playsets together on the back of the Buried Treasure box and it shows all of them on the playmat.I hope this review helps- and if your thinking about getting this playset it is well worth the money especially since it comes with a free playmat and is on sale right now!"
0,1,These don't break as easily for my 4 year old who tends to press hard.  I love that they don't have the paper wrapper and she can twist out more when needed.  They have a thinner diameter so they tend to have a little bit finer point than a traditional Crayon without having to constantly sharpen.
0,1,"Why spend more than $5.00 for something you can get for pennies during back-to-school sales?Because in the long run, these are a much better buy.  Sure, you can buy a few hundred of the old-fashioned crayons for the price of 24 Twistables, but Twistables last much longer, are cleaner, never dull, and are always easy to grip with sturdy plastic 'sleeves'.We're a Twistables family with no desire to ever go back to the paper-wrapper days."
0,1,"My daughter is facinated by monsters and dinasours and was captivated by this toy.  The main problem is that at 5 she has a some problems keeping the parts from coming apart while playing (and keeping her baby sister away from them), so it ends up being kept away except when I can monitor.  Some of the parts have already been lost and may be better for older kids.  But the look is great and definately excites the imagination."
0,1,"Imaginext Dinosaurs' T-Rex is quite simply fun to play with. The dinosaur not only is a great toy, with a lever underneath that reacts with the dino biting and yelping out a loud roar. It comes with a catapult with its respective stones (2) that the caveman (also included, with accessories) can operate, to save himself from the deadly bite of the dino.My 3-year old picked it up since he got it, and he hasn't let go."
1,0,Great idea if it worked all the time. The door sticks and you have to pull it open and the micro phone doesn't work very well.
0,1,"Drawer does not open....at.all!! The lever that releases it inside does not lift high enough. I did not try to return it because my kids had already torn into it, excited to play and the rcpt and box were thrown out but what a joke! I saw in the reviews that this has been an ongoing problem with this toy. I bought it thinking the money was causing those drawers to stick but now I see this is just very poorly made. The company should not continue to sell something that clearly doesn't work.  Too bad because I love the idea and all the other features. If it were not for the malfunctioning drawer it would get a 5 star rating."
1,0,My kids play with this a lot.  They LOVE the scanner becuase it works it actually - scans bar codes off of real items.  They like to play store.  I paired this with Melissa and Doug play money and it was a total hit.
1,0,i love this to i am happy that he got this to iam happy he got this my kids love it that good
0,1,This register was kind of a pain at first. It stopped working shortly after receiving it and had to go through the trouble of getting another. The 2nd one we had no problems.
0,1,My baby loves this pc! We put it on deck and every time we bring her to deck she runs to it..!
0,1,My daughter got this for her first birthday. Here and all her friends loved it. It is not cheap plastic so it has held together outside very well over the last year. Only thing I don't like about this table is the boats are very cheap but I didn't buy it for the boats so I still gave it 5 stars.
1,0,"I recently ordered this table for my son who is 14 months old.  The first time we filled it with water he spent about an hour just standing there and splashing.  He didn't even use the toys that came with the table - splashing in it was enough to keep him entertained.  He now plays with the toys as well but I'm pretty sure would be content if the table had nothing but water in it.  My dogs also think this is a great toy and drink out of it like a giant dog bowl.  This is a pretty simple toy but it is sturdy, easy to clean and put away, and can keep your child entertained for long periods of time.  I definitely think this was worth the money."
1,0,No leaks here because there is no plug. It a wonderful size my toddler daycare kids. They could play with Water Wheel Play Table all day long. I did add more cups and water toys for added fun. For $30 you really can't beat that price. I also got Naturally Playful Sand Table these go great together. LOVE IT! A must for parents and caregivers of toddlers!
0,1,"We purchased this water table a few years ago for use under an outdoor playground/swingset.  It is a basic water table with a tower and a couple of floating boats.  The tower has a cup with a hole in it that lets water run out onto a wheel that spins.  That is pretty much the only moving thing the table does.  The rest is the water table part.  It is a fun table that holds a good amount of water and our kids have a lot of fun splashing around in it.  The table is very sturdy and last a long time.  If you have it outside in the elements, it tends to get a little moldy and get some algae growth in it, so plan on cleaning it often or spraying it off with a pressure washer.  Overall, it is a good, basic water table at a reasonable price.  Recommended!"
0,1,I have a 9 month old and a 3 year old both love it !! The only thing i dont like are the little boats because they dont stay together very well. I would recommend getting little boats that work. Further more if you have a young one learning to wake make sure you put enough water in or it will not support there weight.
1,0,"I wanted a no-frills easy care water table and that's what I got. The boats are flimsy and I've already thrown one away because I was tired of putting it back together for my frustrated daughter. If you plan on supplying your own toys, this is a winner."
1,0,"My mom bought this water table for my 1-year old last year.  It is very sturdy and the perfect height for her plus it came with some cool toys.  My daughter loves to play with it and it has held up well over the last year.  Ours does have a plug and it does leak, but it doesn't really bother me.  I did contact the manufacturer and they sent me new plugs promptly, but it still leaks.  My only complaint is it doesn't have a lid so it gets dirty easily and usually needs washed out before playing with it."
1,0,"My son has been playing with his water table since he was 11 months old. He loves splashing in it. He isn't really interested yet in pouring water into the watermill contraption or moving the boats around. He does like to pick up the boats and run around the yard with them. A word of caution - the sail does not stay connected to the bottom boat piece so be prepared to lose one or the other, or search the yard for them. Overall, I highly recommend this product. My son is always drawn to it, even when it is empty."
1,0,The table is large enough to allow comfortable play with enough water to be fun.  The waterwheel works well and is enjoyed as the water splashes off the wheel as it spins.  It promotes the beginning of understanding of engineering principals so it is educational as well as fun.
0,1,"My son just recently received this water table as a Christmas gift.  He is just about to turn 2 years old and he LOVES playing with the water tower and toy boats and cup that come along with the table.  Though this water table is normally used outdoors, my son plays with the water table indoors because of the cold winter weather. We laid some plastic underneath the table to prevent water spillage and it works great!  It's very easy to assemble and very little clean up.  I do think we will get a few years out of this toy!  I can't wait to use it during the summer months!"
0,1,This water table was a hit for a little girl who wouldn't do a pool or sprinklers during the summer heat. She would splash and splash for hours in this table not only cooling off but learning in the process. Recommended for those hot summer days!
0,1,I didn't want to pay too much for a product like this so I chose this one. I still think its overpriced. Our daughter loves it. She loves to pour using the cup and waterwheel. The boats are a waste. They don't float and are cheap. I don't think it would have cost the company that much to throw Ina better boat.  But overall I highly recommend this product because of how much my daughter enjoys it
0,1,"I would say buy this toy!!!!  My boy is two and loves to play with this.  He splashes, dumps, pours, fills and just plays with the water.  I love it because after I am hot and tired from running around after him we both get a much needed cool down.  Great to have neighbor kids over too.  PS.  Walmart is cheaper - shop around."
0,1,"I love this water table as does my almost two year old daughter.  She actually plays with this more than her baby pool.  Just recently, though, she has been climbing into the table and sitting in it.  I'm not happy about that.  So just be careful and make sure someone is around when they are playing with it."
0,1,"This water table was the biggest outdoor toy hit for three summers, from when my son was 1 to when he was 3.  The water wheel action was fascinating to him; the boats were so fun to float around; and the height of the table was perfect throughout that period.  This is an extremely durable toy that we intend to keep for our future children and pass down to friends for many more years of entertainment."
0,1,"My great grandson loves this and he can shared it with hos brother and  cousins.  It is great for warm weather but safe,"
1,0,"My 7 month old son recently got this set as a gift. While he struggles picking up the balls, he has great fun rolling them all over the floor and he enjoys all the sounds each ball makes. It is always great for me to see him enjoying Fisher-Price toys as I grew up with Fisher-Price too."
0,1,I bought several packages of roll arounds for 7.99 each at a very popular baby store for us.  6 month old loves them.  Since playing with them the baby's  dexterity has improved and tummy time is a lot more fun.  Baby also enjoys munching on them.  Balance has also improved while sitting up as baby reaches for the balls on the floor!  Fun! Educational! BUT  not worth more than 15.00 in my opinion!  Much cheaper in baby or toy store for us!
0,1,"I have several of these peek-a-blocks by Fisher Price and I love them. They are great for older kids to stack and build with, but they are interesting enough to engage a small child with one or two blocks because of the surprises inside."
0,1,"My 15 month old hasn't gotten her hands on these yet (saving for Christmas) but her little friend has a set, and I've been told that they stand up to a LOT of abuse.  Our set was sent on time, but I noticed that some of the little toys inside the blocks seem a little dirty.  IDK how this could be, since the blocks are sealed so that little ones can't get into the small pieces inside.  Guess I'll update this review after my little one gets her hands on these.Update, 8/5/12: My now-16 month old LOVES these little things!  She's able to identify the letters through the toys inside them (""find D for ducky!"").  She hasn't tried stacking them yet, but they get thrown around and scattered (one survived a throw outside onto asphalt with nary a scratch).  I would recommend to anyone with an active toddler!  Oh, and they also amuse them during diaper changes -- another plus!"
0,1,"I really love all the Fisher Price Peek a Blocks---I saw them long before I knew we'd have a surprise #3 baby and I would actually have an excuse to buy them!  Now we own pretty much all the sets.  I would have to say this set, although big, is one of the weaker ones.  The letters on the sides sometimes block seeing what's inside too well, and the toys inside are not as interactive or interesting as is the case with some of these blocks---for example, a horse that just sits there, a zylophone that doesn't move much, an apple that turns.  I like their blocks with tiny things to shake inside or the like---the kind of things babies can't generally play with as they are too small, but that are made safe by being enclosed!  Also, having ABCs is most just a way to have a set here I think---unless you are very into early learning, I don't think most babies are really ready to associate the letters with the toys inside (I know SOME babies are, but not that many, and not mine!)  However, all this said, I still would say to buy this set, if you know you like this kind of block---It's great to add 26 more in one fell swoop!"
0,1,"My daughter (22months) loves her peek a blocks and when she seen these we needed them. She loves to roll the hamster around the house, and kisses him. Even my 2 month old son likes to look at these and tries to grab them."
0,1,"We bought this set for our son when he was six months and it's been a favorite ever since!  We have most of the sets and we always have a few of the balls with us no matter where they go.  He's nine months now and loves to shake, touch or roll the ball and see what it does.  He stares at it trying to figure out how it does it.  These have been a great addition to our toys and I can't wait to get him a few of the toys that use the roll arounds!  They are also VERY durable.  They get thrown or dropped frequently and haven't cracked or show any signs of rough play."
0,1,"My 17 year old granddaughter asked me if I knew where she could buy a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle. She and her boyfriend were looking for an inexpensive ""date"". She is studying Japanese on her own. I couldn't believe that, on amazon.com, I found a Japanese fan shaped puzzle. I also bought the puzzle keeper so that it could be put away while they were still working it. My granddaughter was thrilled."
0,1,This is a great family game. It is harder to play with friends because they don't know your home like the family does. This games does make a mess but part of the game is to clean it up. I will be buying this as a gift for friends birthday parties.
0,1,"If you've ever seen the film ""Name of the Rose"", then you'll have a good idea of the theme of this game.I've always loved the movie with Christian Slater and Sean Connery and it's moody historical story that made you feel like you were in medieval Europe. Unlike the movie, this game fails in so many ways. But before I get ahead of myself, let me give you reasons why;Components: The figurines looked like mini monk statues and really nice sculptures. The board was a overhead illustration of a medieval building with rooms and thematic Latin words. However every now and then, we would draw from a deck of room cards that were black and white (and I thought to myself, ""why are they not in color? Seems like a dumb way to save money""). The box was nice and sturdy and the rules did not seem very complete, and we were house ruling in some things to make it complete.Art/Design: The art is almost comic book looking and seems odd. I have never understood why Clue was so ""cute-sy"" and comic-like if the subject was murder (and the same applies here). Maybe the producer and designer wanted to ""keep-it-light"" and keep it from being too grim? Because murder and a criminal monk isn't a laughing matter. The colors are somewhat muted and the box top's art does not match the inside's almost water color style as well.Game play/Game Mechanics: Every player on his/her turn gets two/three action points. Most people would move two spaces and then ask questions of another investigator/player. Being in any room for the most part, gained no real advantage. At one point all the players stayed in the center room and just asked questions of each other. I took notes in the game we played, but it just seemed to confuse me because at the end of the 4th round, we went to ""mass"" and passed the 4 monk cards to the right. This practically killed my notes. What is odd about this game is, I at no time felt ""immersed"" within the theme. Also, at no time did we the investigators learn who was killed or what crime was committed. Furthermore, we at no time learned motives or other crime investigatory techniques or ways to narrow the search. All we could do is ask weather the guilty monk had a beard, hood or was skinny, etc etc. This series of elimination was downright annoying, and we just started guessing to get the game over with. Basically when you hurry to end a game (just to get it over with) this is a sign of a bad game in my opinion. The room cards that gave you special functions or special powers, gained you practically nothing as well.End Thoughts: I know your going to think I am negative and a ""hater"", but this game really lacks in so many ways. I wanted to love this game since ""The Name of the Rose"" is such an awesome theme and movie. I believe if this game's mechanics and art was altered significantly you'd have an great game. Not learning of who the victim was is like having no body to a murder. In real life, the investigators would have ""nothing"" and the case would get dropped. Thus I intend to drop this game from my collection for I too had no ""body of evidence""."
0,1,"I bought this game for my nephews, 6.5 and 3.5 years, and we all enjoyed it very much. You don't need to count, you don't lose a dice - the idea with the cards is fantastic and we have started to use them to study a foreign language: each one picks a card a announces the color and number (one or two squares) in a foreign language and it becomes educational as well as great fun.Never boring!"
0,1,"I have to admit, we had this toy sitting in it's box, in plain sight for almost 2 months before I was compelled enough to open it. I had been looking for a quiet, light, portable, travel toy for a toddler but when it arrived I wasn't very enthused. That being said, it's not that compact, but it IS light, portable and quiet. AND, even tho when I opened the package I was somewhat disappointed I realize that was simply due to my lack of creativity.One morning, when we had run out of toys to play with I finally succumbed and opened the packaging. And discovered a world of fun! My son (18 months), although completely dis-interested at first, found it fun to play peek a boo with the ""doors"" on each cylinder - open and closing. Of course the ""putting in & taking out"" phase increases interest as well. As another reviewer mentioned - the pig and the sheep are quite small - not quite the right size for the cylinder they fit inside of.However all the being said - I would highly recommend this toy. It's quiet (good for early mornings when everyone else is asleep), and it opens all sorts of possibilities - sorting, counting, stacking, rolling, hiding/unhiding, matching, (even throwing since that's bound to happen sometime or another). It would be even cooler if there would be a way to open the cylinders from the top and have them all stack inside each other as another level of fun (and increase the transportability of the toy as well. If you really squashed all the animals inside it might work... (they are soft and easily compressed if necessary anyways I guess - they feel like little pillows basically).In the end, happy we purchased it. (lucky there was a fee to return it - that's what stayed my hand!)"
0,1,This provides lots of fun for your little one. As they get older they will learn to replace the eggs back together again which will be great for fine motor skill development.
0,1,"I wasn't quite sure how my 6 mo old would react to this toy as she's just learning and discovering toys now that she can sit on her own.  She LOVES this toy.  THe 5 star reviews on here are right!  She enjoys dumping the eggs out of the carton, picking up the shells and putting them in her mouth.  We're waiting for her to learn the cause/effect of pushing the egg down for a squeak.  THis was a great, economical purchase - and I'm glad we snapped it up since I saw that the manufacturer has discontinued this toy now.  I think it'll be a great learning toy in years to come as she matures and starts to use the matching, sorting, pattern capabilities of this toy.  I have to say I expected a stronger ""peep"" from the chicks, it's very subtle.  But I guess that's good so it doesn't get annoying."
0,1,"Purchased this item for my 2 year old Grandson who loves to help his Mom cook.  He really liked the eggs and had fun inserting the egg into the correct shape shorter location on the bottom of the carton.  This toy is made very well and was enjoyed by my 2, 3 and 4 year old Grandchildren."
0,1,"I ordered this item for my daughter last Easter. At the time, she was only 6 months old. Now almost 18 months, she still loves these eggs. She's starting to understand the shape-sorting aspect of the toy and can put the top of the egg shells back together. My 4-year old son also likes playing with this. It's been a favorite at my house for a long time. The only downside is that my son figured out that it he puts the egg in his mouth and blows, it makes a very obnoxious whistling sound. LOL! But other than that this is a great value!"
0,1,"I wasn't sure if my son was old enough for these, so they sat on a shelf for a few months, until one day he noticed them and grabbed them himself. The box is too hard for little ones to open, so he did need some help, but once it was open, he played and played and played and played and played with them. He LOVED them. He loves making them squeak and he loves taking the tops off and putting them back. After he's done, I do make sure I have all the pieces and close the container (knowing he can't get into them on his own) so we make sure to keep everything together. Then he will forget about them for awhile, then he will find them again and want to play with them again--one time, he sat on the couch and played with them for AN HOUR AND A HALF! Now at 21 months he's still a little young to comprehend that the eggs have faces and shapes to match...but if he can sit still and play with these for such long stretches...I'm not complaining."
0,1,"I ordered these for my 17 month old daughter because they looked super cute.  We received them yesterday and we were very disappointed.  The eggs come in a cute container that is easy to open and the faces are cute, however, our eggs don't squeak when you push them down.  I like that they are different colors and the shapes on the bottom of the eggs fits into the shapes inside the container.  This is a little educational for little ones, but they should squeak.  My daughter played with them for about 2 minutes and then started throwing them across the room.  We have a tile floor so I was worried that she was going to break them.  They are still intact so I guess  they are pretty durable, but it is a pretty simple and boring toy.  While these are cute, they just aren't a lot of fun.  I wouldn't recommend these to others."
1,0,"This was a wonderful find.  I had never heard of these before.  And, they stretch a wide age band to enjoy.  We first gave these around 10 months & they were an immediate favorite.  There is something about putting the eggs in & out of the little plastic container as well as putting the 2 sides of the eggs together that the babies love.They are really cute & easy to keep clean.  You can take them anywhere as they are compact; however, be careful not to lose any halves of the eggs.There are no sharp edges & they are the perfect size for little hands.  I would say these are indestructible as they are very durable.What is really neat about these eggs is how educational they are.  Each egg has a different pair of eyes painted on them & they have a corresponding/matching egg top that they have to match or pair up.  Also, the bottum of each egg is a different shape including: triangle, circle, star, square, cross/plus sign, and a heart. Each shape fits into a certain slot in the carton. This is how we taught these basic shapes & pretty quickly.NOTE:  obviously, it takes time for them to learn to match the eyes, shapes, etc & is why this toy stretches out for a wide age span which is nice.  It grows w/ them until they learn all of this.They also have the cutest little squeak when you press down on them.Best of all no batteries or anything loud.  Just pure thoughtful fun.I now give this as a 1 year old gift b/c for some reason, like myself, no one has heard of these.  I haven't seen a baby not immediately go to these.Hopefully these will be found by more people b/c they are wonderful in so many ways."
0,1,"I bought the toy after reading some of the reviews here. I was not disappointed. Our 15 m.o. daughter loves it and spends loads of time opening and closing the eggs and putting them into their container. However her twin brother loses interested easily, as he does with many of his toys.I agree with another reviewer that the egg container is hard to open, and concur that the manufacturer should make it easier.NOTE: I only gave it ""3 stars"" for its educational value; however, when I submitted the review my rating was changed to ""5 stars,"" and I cannot correct it."

0,1,"The ants dig really, really fast: they make something like a tunnel in few first hours; they build an impressive structure within first 1-2 days, and then only slightly expand it. After about a week or so nothing happens anymore, and they just gradually die one by one, and bury their comrades in a cemetery upstairs. Until the last one. So don't expect it to serve as some kind of ""ant analogy to fish tanks"": the joy and fun is all within the first week, 2 weeks at most, and then nothing happens, and it gradually becomes sad and boring.The first week is really great though!When buying ants, try to put them in the habitat as soon as possible. I waited for almost a week, as they arrived earlier than I expected, so half of them dies. I ended up buying a new vial of ants."
0,1,"We bought this ant farm for my five year old son for Christmas. I got online and ordered ants from a different company, but then realized that ants aren't shipped during the winter because of our freezing temperatures. We received our ants in March, and that's when we started our ant farm. I was shocked by how quickly the ants built their tunnels; it was way more fun that I could have ever imagined. Every day when my kids came home from school, they ran to check on the ants, and every morning when they woke up they inspected their progress. Their excitement wore off after a few weeks, and then the ants stopped working after about five weeks. I actually prefer ""temporary toys"" so I didn't mind being finished with the ant farm and throwing it away.I think this would be an excellent gift for a child who is sick or recovering from surgery and is stuck in bed. Or even if you are trying to encourage a child to stop watching television. . . the ants are just as entertaining!"
0,1,I purchased this as a Christmas present for my grandson.  It looks pretty intriguing and I am sure he will enjoy it more when his mother can order the ants that will be necessary to complete the gift.
1,0,"This was as fun ant farm. I always wanted one a child, and never got one, so of course I had to get one for my son. We opted to collect our own ants instead of order some. We found some to put in, but not quite as many as was recommended. We also found a larvae and were excited to see something happen with it. Unfortunately it never did anything, though it was fun to watch the ants protect it by moving it to new rooms and tunnels they created. The ants did not last long,as other reviewers mentioned. I think my son at some point added some crumbs for the ants, and that caused mold to develop on the top of the cage, and it grew and grew, and we had to throw the whole things away.I don't know if there is a way to order new blue gel for it, but that would make it more likely for us to order this product again. The blue gel is nice for viewing the ants do all kinds of things. Overall a fun product that we will probably order gain."
1,0,"This is a beautiful paint by number. My end result was amazing.  It is a standard size paint by number, and comes with a brush and paints.  You do have to mix about half of the colors, but that was actually fun to do, I just used an old plate as a palate, I always ended up mixing way to much, so I recommend just tiny amounts of each color paint and mix more if needed.  The instructions were very easy to follow and included tips on different brushes and painting techniques. I used some of the blending as recommended and it softens the areas between colors, so you get a much softer effect. The end result does not look like a typical paint by number, it looks like a real painting.  It was very fun to do, and my children think its very pretty.  I love paint by numbers and would highly recommend this one.  Easy to use, and great results."

0,1,"I purchased this product (3 of them) to be a prize for the winner of games durring my daughters 3rd birthday party. there were 5 diffrent prizes to win, and these were the most fun by far! the children who actually won them chased around all the children who did not win a whistle, blowing and tooting. All had a ball!There was one thing about the whistles, the flappy end, (its a thin yet durable rubber) was stuck together when 1st opened, a quick roll between the fingers fixed that quickly!the whistles are not too loud and sound like whoopie cushions. I would buy them again, but I would put them in the goody bag instead of giving as a prize because all the children who did not get one REALLY wanted one. We even had 2 children who cried because they did not win one but they soon forgot and enjoyed the fun of the winners blowing."
1,0,A perfect gift for someone I work with. We seek guidance from this ball when work becomes particularly frustrating - it's the perfect perk for us to get through the rest of the day.

0,1,These blocks were much smaller than I expected.  I was hoping they would be larger like the ones at grandma's house (that are 30+ years old).  Overall they are great.  The colors are bright and since they are smaller my 1 year old can handle them very well.  I am always happy with the quality of Melissa and Doug products.
0,1,"We actually gave this as a gift, but I love Melissa and Doug products.  I think this toy will be around for quite some time.  It reminded me of a block set that I had as a child, so how can you go wrong with such a classic toy?"
0,1,"Great toy!  It's great that you can configure the toy in various ways.  The colors are great, the toy is sturdy and well made.  My 18 month old loves this toy."
0,1,"We bought this for our almost-2-year-old for Christmas. I find the around-two age to be the most difficult to shop for as children this age are intellectually ready for more complex intellectually-stimulating toys, but still feel the need to explore things with their mouths, which really limits the things you can buy to being below their skill level, at their skill level and a choking hazard, or bright and flashy with lots of lights (yuck).So, enter this stacker, a perfect complex little twist on the original stacker concept, requiring a little more thought and dexterity, and with the added interest of multiple layers. It can actually be assembled in a different order each time, so there are a few methods to getting it all put together. The pieces are a good size, and the Plan Toys water-based dyes won't come off if a toddler feels the need to taste it.Hopefully it will be a big hit Christmas morning. If not, I'll probably get a good bit of play out of it myself. I think it's a wonderful little puzzle."
0,1,"My twin girls are 2y9m - a bit on the older side for this but with one more baby on the way I figure we'll get more use out of it.  I wish we had gotten it last year!  We got them a different stacker last year that they just never got in to.  They have both played with this a lot, putting it together in various configurations, and using the hollow centerpieces as ""telescopes.""  A nice, sturdy, engaging, indestructable toy.  A little pricey, but otherwise great!"
0,1,"What. The. Crap. All these dolls are wearing mini skirts. If MGA was aiming to achieve a degree of realism with this line, they've done it. The Bratz look like realistic posers. When was the last time you went golfing in a mini skirt? Honestly, the only girl I know who went golfing in a mini skirt works in the adult film industry. But I digress.As for durability, I haven't heard good reviews about the Bratz's feet. Apparently they're flimsy and fall of easily. Bratz may be willing to spend two hundred dollars and an entire afternoon getting a pedicure, but really, what's the point if your feet won't stay ON?I understand that these girls are fashion dolls. I accept that. They're good at their jobs. They're just not good at sports. At least Barbie dresses APPROPRIATELY when she yells fore. There's a fine line between being fashionable and being a skank. A very, very fine line.

It is challenging and ever changing.Well worth every penny. Go for the biggest set you can afford."

0,1,"San Juan is a perfect introduction to the role selection game mechanic that seems to now pervade many of the top euros.  San Juan is also a really well done reduction of its parent game, Puerto Rico, which though recently bumped from the #1 spot on[...], has been a top game for 4-5 years running.The card driven system is pretty easy to learn.  Essentially, all of the cards in the game represent something you have the option of building, when the builder role is in play, and if you can afford it.  You pay for these buildings by discarding other cards from your hand, minus any specific discounts you may have earned.  You don't automatically get new cards... you must work for them, by either building and using production building, special buildings, or making specific role choices when it is your turn.  This mechanic can lead to some really agonizing (which is why it's fun) decisions.While I do highly recommend this game, I personally can only give it 4 stars, mainly due to the amount of chance involved in the game.  That's something inherent in most card games though, and while it is a factor, generally experienced players with well vetted strategies will perform well.I started out playing Puerto Rico, then tried this game and fell in love.  It's not as rich or deep a gameplaying experience, but it is much more approachable.  If you've played neither, I'd recommend giving San Juan a shot, and if you do end up liking it, move on to Puerto Rico.  If you like that, then you're in luck!  There's a whole world of fantastic games out there waiting for you to play them."
0,1,"This is a great family or classroom game!  Really young kids can play with just a basic understanding of green = go, red = stop while older kids can practice their basic math skills.  I've heard of numerous variations to make the game more challenging such as switching the meaning of colors, adding point values to colors, etc.  I love the simplicity of this game!  It's so easy to learn and play that it makes a great game for wide age groups.  The components are so simple (just dice that fit in a plastic bag that comes with the game) that it can be taken anywhere!  I'd highly recommend this to parents or teachers!"

Much better than the cartoon - like cards from &#34;brighter child&#34;, and comes in nicer storage box than most brands too (she loves to stack them in the box and pull them out over and over). They aren't terribly sturdy (not board - book style) but not too flimsy either. They usually bend back into shape pretty well after inevitable bending."

1,0,The toddler in our family enjoys the colors and stacking.  She will play for a full hour just stacking and re-stacking.
0,1,"I really like Melissa & Doug toys however, we've only had this toy for two days and with three children playing with it (total probably 4 hours of play so far), the sticks were not glued into base and quickly popped off (the baby did that first thing after removing all the pieces). The other part I did not like was the fact that paint is starting to come off already on the square pieces (on the corners). Even if the paint is lead-free, I still don't think it should come off after two days of play. I am hoping to write the company and ask them about that."
0,1,"my two years old doesn't seem to appreciate this much yet. She kept taking everything off and just randomly lay them out on the table. Since every kid is different, i will give a bit of time, i think it will have good educational value eventually.  However, one disappointment is one of the stick came loose after just a few months. And she wasn't even playing that much with it, this shows the quality still needs improvement."

I gave the pieces I didn't need to my baby to use with her single stacker, that came with just the round ones, and she can stack any of the three sets.  My five year old still plays with it creatively.  After about 7 years, the pieces have held up rather well, but some of the paint has come off---not all, or even most, but I wouldn't want to give it to a teething kid.  [Towers of Hanoi puzzle:  how can you move the stack from one stick to another 1) moving one piece at a time and 2) only putting a piece on an empty stick or on a piece larger than itself.  For example, lets say the stack (ordered by width, with widest on the bottom) start off on the leftmost stick, we'll call A, and we want to move it to the rightmost stick, we'll call C.  The top piece, the smallest, can be moved to either stick B in the middle or stick C.  If we put it on stick C, the top piece on stick A, now second to smallest, can NOT be placed on stick C, because a smaller piece is there, so we can only move it to stick B.  Now try moving all 7 pieces in this way...]"
0,1,"I was so excited to open this ""toy"" for my kids. I was looking for something a little more fun then a poster or globe for my kid's playroom. They are both a little young for it now so it is a fun ball and decorative item and will be a learning tool later. My husband and I even sat with it and studied it, so it hopefully will get some interest from the kids. Better then a globe you have to be careful with. I haven't tested out its accuracy yet, will update if I find anything that is incorrect. Great product for $20!"
0,1,By far my son's FAVORITE gift he got for Christmas.  &#34;Santa&#34; brought this for him!!  So worth the money even if it is a little small.  But he's only 4 and it works perfectly for him.  The controller is way easy for him to use and hold and the car is easy to use for him as well.  He's hoping for it to snow or rain or something so he can use it outside!!
0,1,"TERRIBLE.  Bought it for our son and the 1st time he used it, it broke.  Well it broke after it ran out of batteries.  Don't waste your time or money."
0,1,"My grandson LOVED this...he is 6.  Also gave his 4 year old brother one as well.  They had fun playing with them, and I was surprised how fast and powerful these seemed to be.  We just tried them in the house.  They were eager to try them outside later."
0,1,"We were excited for this car and bought it for out 4 year old for Christmas.  it came quickly and looked like a lot of fun.  However, the remote only works when standing right next to the car.  It had about a 3 foot range, and as soon as the car got out of range, it would stop.  We were forced to return it."
1,0,"I bought this for my grandson's third birthday because he was always begging to use the older boys' RC cars. He has a couple of toys that have wired remotes and those just aren't as much fun. The body of the Morphibian is nice and sturdy, and best of all it has a wireless remote. At the birthday party, we held this present back until last and it was a good thing we did. He wasn't interested in any of his other presents once he opened this one. He plays with it every day and the older boys are relieved that he doesn't want to play with their more delicate RC cars now.  The only improvement I can see is that the antenna could be attached a little better. My grandson started out picking it up by the antenna and we had to reattach the plastic sleeve on the antenna once. We had to tell him once not to pick it up that way, and he hasn't done it since and the antenna wasn't damaged. My grandson loves this toy and is so proud to have his own RC car that works just like the big boys' cars."
1,0,"Had this for over a year.  Durable, the batteries last, great in the house or on a flat surface.  Doesn't do well in grass or sand, unless the sand is packed.  Goes in the water, but leaks and sinks within about 15 minutes.  Perhaps we have a defective unit, but after one session in water I had to quickly disassemble it to dry and WD40 the motors and wiring.  It was fine after that episode, but we've kept it out of the water since."
1,0,"This is a pretty good toy for the money. The instinct to pull the toy out of the water by the antennae is a problem. Of course kids are going to do it but adults can't even fight the impulse. So that's kind of annoying because you have to re-thread the antennae back through the small ""straw"" that holds it upright.Also -- this should be obvious but don't put the remote control in the water! My 12 year old nephew didn't realize it... and I didn't know he had it in the pool until it was too late. Luckily, after 24 hours of drying out, it works again.So it seems like a durable little toy and fun too. I wouldn't pay a dime more for it though."
1,0,"Durable, water resistant, great on batteries, what can I say?First, the cons, the remote. Now, the steering is a bit strange. Push both joysticks up and it goes forward, push both of them down and it goes backwards... push the left side up and both left wheels on the RC car start spinning, causing it to spin right. Push the left stick down and the left wheels spin backwards, causing it to turn left.Soooo... the left joystick controls the left wheels and the right stick, the right wheels. The way of turning the vehicle isn't by the front wheels turning left or right, it's by both left wheels spinning at the same time. This causes the vehicle to spin out quickly if trying to turn and learning the controls is definitely going to take a bit of time.But, my son loves it. Can he drive it properly..? No. Does he love it anyways? Mostly. He does get frustrated. I wish... and this is a long shot, I wish it had both options. A regular remote and a control system for when you're in the water. I understand why the RC car is the way it is, but that doesn't mean I like it.I would definitely buy it again though. It's speedy, my son enjoys chasing it around while I control it and he's able to play with it alone for a bit before getting frustrated that he can't control where it goes.I bought it as a beginner RC car for my toddler that can go through a puddle if necessary, as he's a toddler. I really wish the driving was better, but what can you do?"
0,1,"I love that the pregnant Midge is back!  The face is different than the Happy Family version and there are no freckles.  I am just so happy to see her back.  We got the Happy Family version and it really taught my 4 year old about the ""facts of life"" in a non threatening, age appropriate way.  10 stars for educational value!  I did not see if this version still had the wedding ring painted on.  There is also a nusery playset, but that one does not have the pregnant Midge."
0,1,"I lost most of my stock clips so I decided to get some spares. I have a Rustler VXL so I got the &#34;heavy duty&#34; clips, which are larger and thicker. I haven't had a single problem with these regular clips, which cost less than the HD ones. Holding up nicely!"
1,0,For some reason I keep losing these things when I change out my battery.  Then I end up taking one off the body to make the battery stay in place. In the end I keep having fewer and fewer of these around.  Its a good idea to just order these and keep a few somewhere handy as they just seem to magically disappear.
0,1,"My son and I love Stomp Rockets.  They deteriorate over time, though.  I wish they were more durable.  If left in the yard, under a lot of sunlight seems to speed up its deterioration."
0,1,"Make sure you get the correct rocket for the correct blaster --amazon sells three.  I recommend extras because the ones the come with the rockets are too easily lost, or eaten by a retrieving dog, over a fence which contains a vicious dog, etc.  always use these rockets I. Wide open spaces.  They are, truly &#34;a blast!&#34;"
0,1,"My grandsons love to play with the Ultra Stomp Rocket.  I purchased these refills when I bought the rocket.  They have so much fun with it that I just ordered another rocket and refills for some younger grandsons.  But, you don't have to be a boy to like it....I think girls would also enjoy playing with it....I just don't have granddaughters in that age group...it won't be long before they are old enough for me to get them their own rocket."
1,0,THese came to me already opened..but I guess that's not a big deal since everything was in the pack.  They work just perfectly for rocket refills.  Had to have these since we bought the rocket launcher.
0,1,"I bought 3 of these, one for my 4 yr old, one for my 8 yr old and another for my friend's 3 yr old. Every single kid loves it.My two spend hours 'fighting', shooting foam rockets at each other from room to room. They are pretty good at cleaning them all up, even though we have found a few under furniture.I wouldn't call it durable, because foam and light plastic can and will break pretty easily. But thus far, we are doing ok.These are great for birthday party gifts for those that don't want to spend much money."
1,0,My girls opened this item on Christmas morning and played with it all day. It was one of their favorites!
1,0,"My 3yr old loves it.  Not much else to say as it serves its purpose.  As for the look and construction, it does look realistic.  The pizza cutter is well constructed.  In between each slice of pizza is velcro.  So when she uses the roller, it makes a nice &#34;velcro separating&#34; sound.She pretends shes at the local pizza spot baking her parents a pie."
0,1,"""Santa"" made this toy for my two year old for Christmas and he is very happy with it. It seems durable enough so far, although it isn't coated in vinyl like I would prefer in play food. At times my son finds it hard to use the pizza cutter to separate the slices but I think a little challenge is good for him. He absolutely loves the cheese and pepper shakers and plays with those items all the time now in his play kitchen. My friend also got her son the same toy and she too is very pleased with it. Other reviewers stated the pizza slicer came apart, and though I haven't had any problems with mine I could foresee that happening eventually but I still think the toy is plenty fun enough to buy anyway. I also purchased the Learning Resources - Smart Snacks Piece-A-Pizza Fractions in search of the best pizza set and eventually sent that one back and settled on this one. My son loves to call everything pizza so I knew he would get a kick out of this and I am still pleased with it a week after Christmas."
0,1,This set is adorable. My daughter loves to &#34;bake&#34; us pizza in her little kitchen. The pizza has Velcro that cut easily with the pizza cutter. Would totally buy this again.
1,0,GREAT TOY... NICELY PUT TOGETHER... THIS IS THE SECOND CASH REGISTER WE ARE ON AS A FAMILY... AND IT IS PUT TOGETHER NICELY AND THERE ARE SOME NEW FEATURES..
0,1,Daycare kids love this. only issue is the top yellow scale piece comes right off. Have to look for it quite often
0,1,This gift was a big hit.  All of the grandkids wanted to play with it.  Unfortunately it was delayed in shipping three times and arrived later than expected.  The drawer doesn't seem to want to close to allow the machine to turn off with the off button.  The display constantly says drawer open even when it is closed.  Fortunately it has an automatic shut off after 5 minutes of inactivity.  I may be returning for a replacement but haven't decided yet.
0,1,"At first appearance this looks like a very good cash register for kids. It has the scanner, card swiper, scale, play money, cash drawer, digital display, and build in basic math games.Unfortunately I've run into a few problems with it, the software is bugged and it can cause it to 'freeze' up and no longer work. For example all the lights will be on and it will be repeating a sound continuously forever. The only way to reset it is to get a screwdriver and remove the batteries. There is no on/off switch just a volume switch. To turn it off there is an &#34;Off&#34; button on the keypad, but when the software is locked up it doesn't work. Best I can tell, this is being caused when my daughter presses multiple buttons at the same time or in quick succession.Another issue is the cash drawer and coin slot have switches to tell if they are closed. If they are not closed ... absolutely nothing at all on the entire cash register will work. This is a huge design flaw, a single failure in one of those two switches will render the entire thing useless! There is no reason at all for the entire thing to cease functioning in entirety if one of those is open (in reality or not).Other more minor complaints are that the cash drawer flies out at such speed that if you don't hold it with your hand to slow it down the coins get shot out of it. It's not going to hurt anyone, it's just annoying that every time you open the drawer the coins go flying out. Kids may think this is funny though, so you can consider this a plus or a minus.Other notes are the scanner is really just a button, and the scale is just for show (it doesn't do anything for ringing up products). The register comes with plastic pennies, nickles, dimes, and quarters. Then for bills it has ones, fives, tens, and twenties however the drawer only has three slots for the bills. The bills are printed to all look like the one dollar bill in design, the others do not have the modern look to them that real money does (so they all have the 90's look to them ... well technically the one dollar bill has looked the same since the 30's).To conclude, when it is working the register is quite nice and is a good tool for children to learn about money, how to make change, and learn math with larger numbers. All the while they can have fun doing it. These are important lessons for everyone to learn, just hope they don't learn about easy credit with the &#34;Credit Approved!&#34; fake credit card that lets them charge away thousands of dollars ;)"
0,1,"I was even having fun with this toy. My kids were fighting over it. I would recommend laminating the money like a lot of others have. It's fun to just play with, but it has several math games with three levels of difficulty each. Perfect for maybe k-3 rd grade.The scanner scans anything you touch on it, and brings up a random price. It also has a coupon that you can scan, and you can pay with either cash or credit card. Fun toy, and very educational once your kids are old enough to use it correctly. And before then, it is just great for pretend play."
0,1,"THere are  many toy cash registers in the market, and I am so glad I purchased this one, even if for the heaftier price of $39.  Both my daughters 3 and 7 are having fun playing with it, but my 7 year old is also learning about money/change with it.When you ring the ""bill"" up, you can enter a total amount (e.g. $15) and when you select payment it will ask you whether it will be cash or charge.  If you select cash, you then input the amount handed to you by the customer (e.g. $20) and it will tell you how much change the customer is due (i.e. $5).  If you select credit, you run the credit card by the card slot, and it makes fun noises to check whether it's approved or not, and finally approves the charge.  You can also put coins through another slot and it will tell you the value of each denomination.Another feature is that you can use it as a calculator, or as a game for addition/subtraction.  So many uses, with fun all over.If you are buying this for a young child, say 2-4, some of the less expensive models will do, but if you want it to be something he/she can grow into and learn from, this looks like a pretty durable toy to last a few years."
1,0,"I just received this toy as a Christmas present for my children.  I haven't used it yet, so I can't review the toy itself yet.  But, I wanted to comment on the packaging.The toy was shipped in it's original box, which came very dented, dinged, ripped, and covered in stickers.  My kids saw it sitting on the front porch and immediately knew what it was (we played some trick on them).  I will have to take this out of the box to set up for Christmas, as the box is completely inadequate.  If I were buying this as a gift for someone else I would not be very happy.Also, the packaging inside the box is not sufficient to protect the cash register for that kind of shipment.  No air bubbles, peanuts, wrap, anything like that.  Just banged up box, and plastic register.It still may be a good toy, but beware if you are buying as a gift for someone else!"
1,0,"We bought this over a year ago for our then one-year-old son.  His older brother and sister (ages 4 and 6) loved it then, too, and all 3 kids still enjoy it now.  Definitely one of our best purchases ever!"
0,1,"The only reason I am giving this tunnel 2 stars is because the tunnel is so narrow that the popular Thomas the tank engines and friends that run on batteries and fit on all the wooden rails ways will not fit into the tunnel. The tunnel itself is made of solid heavy wood and made very well, we just cant use it with the trains we have. Very disappointed."
0,1,We are very happy with the construction of this roundhouse and the fact that it works with the Thomas Wooden Railway system but is only half the price of the Thomas brand roundhouse!
0,1,"This is a really cute wagon, especially for when my kiddo was around 1, but he quickly outgrew it.  It is smaller than expected; it would be cute and perfect as a baby shower gift, with a few items in it, like a stuffed animal, blankets, and wrapped in cellophane with ribbon."
0,1,"I have had one of these for 10 years or so.  It used to hold a flat of flowers (very cute in the garden) but now sits on a dresser and holds a teddy bear.  The plant time caused a little almost-rust area around the screws, even though I thought I had it totally lined in plastic.  I bought several more to use as centerpieces in a Chicago-themed party (Radio Flyer is a Chicago-based company).  These are not heavy-duty wagons, but for the price are adorable and they were a big hit."
0,1,"Yes, it is small for babies or toddlers.  Other than that my 5yr old loves it.  Easy to assemble.  I would have loved a little bigger one though."
0,1,"I will say that it does have different types of button and switches so it teaches your child about pushing buttons, turning dials, sliding levers, etc.  I just wish there was a volume control, because for me it's a little on the loud side.  My 1 year old can't do all the buttons on his own, and doesn't play with it much, but maybe when he's older.  There are a variety of sounds, which at least holds my interest."
0,1,We got this for my grandson (4) who loved following mommy around while she was vaccuuming.  He loves it and is always using it.  Highly recommend.
0,1,This is an interesting toy. Our 22m old liked it a lot. When we opened it we took away most of the cards and gave our daughter only 3 cards.  There are a lot of parts and we did not want them to get lost. Cards are not too large only about 2.5in by 4in. online picture made it look like these cards were 8in by 11in.  Now that we played with it I am glad they are small. Our daughter likes the size. The problem that we had with this set is that the foam is too thin. I wish it was thicker. Cards are very soft. When our 22m old caries them around parts can come out. I would not give these cards to the kid and walk away. This toy is a lot of fun when you play with it together.
0,1,"we got one of these when my little one was 1.  It was great to watch her eyes as we made the butterfly fly as we moved our arm up and down.  The little wings flap and now as a two year old, she is putting it on herself and moving her arm up and down to make it fly on her own.  The cutest part is that whenever she sees a butterfly in a book or hears the word, she puts her finger out and moves her arm up and down, even when the puppet is no where to be found.  So cute and fun.  Great puppet."
0,1,"Very nice set of Bead Set, My daugther 5 year old really start like to do this kind of stuff from now on and i think box set like this is perfect."
0,1,"I am very happy with this product which was a Christmas present for my 2-year-old son. The vehicles and signs are very well made, durable and sturdy. I bought the giant road rug to go with the cars and it seems to be a good match. Highly recommended!"
1,0,THESE BLOCKS WERE A WELCOMED ADDITION TO THE MANY MUNIPLUTIVE TOYS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR CHILDCARE CENTER.  THEY ADD MUCH VALUED PLAY TO OUR CHILDRENS EVERY DAY ACTIVITIES. I WOULD NOT HESISTATE TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM AT ALL. THE QUALITY IS SUPURB AND THE PRICING IS RIGHT.
1,0,"These remind me of toys I might have had as a child.  They are a bit crude compared to the slick toys kids have today.  They are a bit retro looking.  The dolls do bend, but it isn't easy.  Arms and legs are just covered wire.  The dolls are cloth.  If you are giving them to a child who will really play with them, I'm guessing they'll get very dirty.  I got them for my granddaughter.  I liked the grandparent dolls.  My granddaughter is very careful with her toys, so I think these will last and be fine.  These would not be for rough-and-tumble kids!  Painted faces - no moving eyes!  I do think they'll be great for imaginative play."
0,1,Perfect size and material for my three year old granddaughter.  Certainly is better than the 65 year old ones of mine!
0,1,"Sturdy foam 1 to 10 puzzle pieces that offer lots of self-correcting pincer-grasp activities for my 3yo. My infant grabbed a few pieces and chomped on them and thankfully was not able to rip off a piece...so I'm happy with the sturdy factor and the nice large no-choking size of the pegs.The number itself pops into the top piece, then that piece attaches to the bottom piece where the corresponding number of pegs pop into.Some things we're doing:1. Put the number where it fits in the top tile.2. Count out the pegs as you put them in the holes in the bottom tile3. Attach the top tile to the corresponding bottom tile.4. Arrange the tiles from 1 to 10.5. Least to greatest/greatest to least."
0,1,"I plan to include these in the goodie bags for my son's train themed birthday.  With conductor hats and red bandanas, I think the kids will love them!"
0,1,"This whistle has the most beautiful sound, my kids and I both really enjoy it. It added some fun to my son's train engineer Halloween outfit.... I can't give it 5 stars because it is SO big and the part that you blow in is on the end  and you have to cover the entire thing with you mouth while blowing out for it to work - therefore being nearly impossible for my 1&3 year olds to use alone."
0,1,RPM made a very strong product that will take a beating. This bumper has saved my Stampede from a lot of damage.
0,1,"As other have pointed out, this really is one of the first upgrades you should make to parts on your r/c car. It says that it is compatible with the Traxxas Rustler, Stampede, Nitro Sport and Bandit, so we recommend its use on any or all of those vehicles.Our r/c crazy 14 year old has been running and racing cars and trucks for about five years. He has this front bumper installed on a Bandit and Rustler and can absolutely attest to its ability to protect those vehicles and their parts. We keep a couple of these in our tool & parts box, and just put a new one one as an old one finally gives way or starts to wear thin.We live in a community with blacktop roads and light traffic, so our son has plenty of time and space to overgear and practice high speed runs and jumps. The OEM front bumper was not as forgiving or as shock absorbing when those runs ended abruptly at a concrete curb, or when jumps ended with a nose dive. This front bumper takes those hits very well, and helps protect everything behind it.Our property has about an acre of grass, dirt and hills (and trees...) so his cars get a lot of off road use too. Again, this bumper take a licking but keeps on ticking and we have not had to replace as many suspension and chassis parts since he began using it.R/C running, racing and bashing continues to be an outstanding experience for him and that has been a blast to watch evolve. This front bumper has just helped that journey be a little less expensive.Go for it and have fun!"
0,1,My 3yr old daughter saw this toy at the park and loved the older kids playing with it so I bought one for her on line.  She only weighs 25lbs so she had a hard time launching the rockets until she started to jump on it with both feet very hard.  She loves it.  well worth the $12 bucks I paid.
1,0,"I bought this toy after our extended family (kids ages 2-20) enjoyed playing with the one that was in the condo we rented on the beach.  That one had clearly been played with a lot and was still in good shape.  Haven't had the opportunity to use ours yet, but I expect the same results.  You do want to have a good sized open area to play with it as even our youngest one was able to stomp it hard enough to make it go a distance.  Like nearly any toy, it could be dangerous if misused...you don't want to be launching the rockets right at someone or looking right into one when it launches, but even if you did it would likely hurt but not cause serious injury."
0,1,"Easy to understand and play, my son loved it and the projectile flies high really.loved is tough, and very simple and fun."
0,1,WOW!  Santa brought this toy for my kids today and we ALL (kids and adults) love it.  It really goes high; buy the extra rockets just in case one gets stuck in a tree.  This was played with for hours today.  Really great toy and a great price.
1,0,"excelent quality and all is complete, this is beautiful and cool, all the specification is really, thanks i recomend it"
0,1,These are a cool toy and a great gift for 4 year olds. It is one of my go to birthday gifts.
1,0,"My girls have loved this. It seems sturdy and as long as you don't play with it in the trees, should last for quite a while. :)"
0,1,This was a major hit at my sons 6th birthday party!! Had the kids going wild running around and jumping trying to make them go higher !!! You wont be disappointed !
0,1,"THESE DOLLS ARE VERY CUTE AND EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE TWINS THEY EACH SEEM TO BE VERY UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER IN STYLE & PERSONALITY. THEY ARE BOTH CUTE BUT THE ONE IN PINK APPEARS TO BE THE SOFTER MORE FEMININE ""GOOD GIRL"" TWIN. THE ONE IF RED SEEMS TO BE A BIT MORE OUTGOING, STRONG-WILLED & INDEPENDENT. BUT I DON'T THINK I WOULD CALL HER ""BAD"". I CALL HER THE TOUGH ONE. THIS IS A VERY NICE SET. I GIVE IT 5 STARS."
0,1,My 2 1/2 year old played with these once and that was IT ! He prefers the hotwheels and matchbox cars much MUCH more. This product is better suited for kids under 2 years of age IMO.
0,1,"My son has had this set of vehicles for over a year (he's 2.5 years old now). I really debated back when I bought these if they were worth the price. I'm so glad I believed the other reviewers and gave this adorable vehicle set a chance. These vehicles have been in the bath tub, the sandbox and all over our house. They are incredibly durable and clean up really easy, in fact they still look new even thought they've been played with on and off for a year. As a bonus, I don't mind him using them on wooden furniture because the wheels don't cause any damage. I also think it was a great idea by the toy maker to allow all of the vehicles (except the boats) to connect together. My son is just starting to do this on his own and enjoys making long trains. This is a wonderful, simple, durable, non-electronic and open-ended toy that my son has definitely enjoyed.UPDATE: My son is now almost 3.5 and still plays with this set regularly. We still have our original set of 4 inch vehicles, and have purchased a few more 4 inch vehicles as well as a couple of the 5 inch ones. These are used in his rice box during the winter and out in the sandbox in the summer. This is definitely one of the most long lived and best toys I've purchased for my son."
0,1,This giraffe puppet is great.  I only wish it was as nice and thick/fluffy as the Aurora Plush 12&#34; Petey Puppet we bought.  He needs to be softer and larger but otherwise good quality.
0,1,I think this item is so educational for little ones . A gift that keeps on giving . delivery was quick and easy to open
0,1,"A great way to both learn spanish, and practice matching in English.Our children ask to play with this and the quality (thickness) of the cards is just great. The kids can play with them and you don't need to worry about them getting bent."
0,1,This educational toy is very well presented. It was shipped in a timely fashion. I believe it will bring hours of enjoyment to my grandson while giving him a very basic educational experience.
0,1,"My 16 month old granddaughter likes to sit with me on the piano bench of the real baby grand piano that I have in my living room and play the keys with me, and also listen to me play children's songs. A relative bought her this toy piano to use in the apartment my granddaughter lives in. She likes to sit on the bench and play it, but no more so than some of her other much less expensive musical toys. Before you purchase this, here are some things to consider:1. This is absolutely NOT something to buy if you are interested in teaching your child to play the piano. This is a cute toy, not a musical instrument. It sounds nothing like a real piano, feels nothing like a real piano, and in fact sounds the same as smaller toy pianos that cost a small fraction of the price.The word ""fancy"" does not apply to the musical quality, just the eye appeal.2. If you want to play songs like Row Row Your Boat or Twinkle Twinkle Little Star for your child on a toy piano, you don't need as many keys as this toy piano has. All you need is a toy piano with a single octave (8 white keys), which virtually every toy piano has.3. This is very cute for a little girl, but I also think it is very pricey. I think my granddaughter would be just as happy sitting on the floor and playing a smaller and much less expensive toy piano (in fact we have an inexpensive rubber electronic keyboard with rhythm sounds that she likes to play sitting on my living room floor).Bottom line: This product is well made and looks very nice. But I think the eye appeal is mainly for parents and relatives. Absent having a real piano, I think a smaller and much less expensive toy piano would provide just as much fun and entertainment. For me this is not a product where you get the ""bang for the buck."""
0,1,"As an Early Interventionist, these bowls are used just about for everything from sorting to matching, to teaching about positive and negative behaviors simply by using specific colors."
0,1,"For some reason when I looked at the picture, I thought the bottoms would be rounded. They aren't and have flat bottom and the sides meet up at an angle.  I bought these with the &#34;TRANSPARENT COUNTERS 250-PK 3/4 6&#34;  I wasn't sure but the colors matched up perfectly. My 2 and 4 year old likes handling them and sorting them in the bowls. Bowls have lots of other uses too so I am happy with my purchase. I don't know of these bowls are food safe but my boys ask to eat their chips in them."
0,1,I have been using these bears to teach my daughter her colors.  They work great and we have lots of fun playing with them.
0,1,"This toy can be educational - with sorting and colors and counting. However, the bears are also wonderful just to play with by themselves.  Very colorful and fun for a wide range of ages."
0,1,"the cups are flimsy, but the bears are super cute. great product over all. The colors are great and vibrant and my kids love them. I take these with me to events and it helps keep my three year old distracted for a while."
0,1,"Huge Hit. I'm pretty sure I already wrote a review for these on another item.. weird. Anyways, these were a huge hit with the 2-3 yr old. She started sorting them immediately. Love the bears :)"
0,1,I bought this for my peace of mind. So many peices with this collection!But this is a great way to store all the Critter stuff. The drawer is large and the edges keep things from ending up on the floor. We have the large house with the green roof and it just fits with a little room all around. You could also just use the table to play without a house as there is a scene painted on the table.I used a power screw driver and put it together in about 20 minutes (I'm pretty good at assembling things). It is very sturdy and has lots of bracing at all the corners. I have one visable chip on a corner but since I got this at a crazy low Amazon price I'll just get out some white paint and deal with it. FYI Ships in original packaging.
0,1,Elmo is sweet to look at...used puppets with my sons 40 years ago and my sons found it was easier talking to a puppet then telling the parents things.  puppets really work
0,1,"While very cool, he falls apart if you touch him, at all. I realize that's in character; however, Yahoo's figure really does fall apart very easily. I give it 4 stars because it is so artfully made. Durability gets 1 star. Definitely made for presentation, not play."
1,0,I am a homeschool mom and I had high hopes for this.  We used this twice (not for long and very gentle) and on the third time it didn't turn on.
1,0,"This was a wonderful Christmas gift.  Not only was it appreciated by my niece and her husband, for their son, but it's a gift that keeps on giving - everytime it's used.  PS...My great nephew loved it!"
1,0,"O.K., I know that people are complaining about the fact that instead of finding out who committed murder one, you have to find out who ate a piece of cake at a certain time, with a certain beverage. These babyish details have not derailed the fun for either my daughter or me. As a matter of fact, I chose this version at a thrift store as opposed to another Clue, Jr. version (at the same thrift store) that seemed even more babyish due to dopey lookin' kids searching for a mutt (or something akin to that). The game does not seem too difficult, nor too simple. I think that this game could possibly be too above a five-year-old's head, but from sixish on would be great fun. After placing ""do-not-peek"" time and beverage bases in the center of the board in order to establish the crime scene, you place cardboard characters in the white time bases and furniture pieces in the yellow drink bases (including the ""crumb evidence"" base, which a character resides on). All these aforementioned pieces are placed in certain rooms on the board. Play begins by rolling the die: if you roll to the yellow side of the die, you can look under any piece of furniture; if you roll white, you may peek under any character. If you roll a number of spaces, you can move any character in a certain direction in order to get to the info you desire in order to win the game that much quicker. You can try to land on yellow footprints within a room in order to peek under the piece of furniture within that room, you can land on white footprints within a room to look under a character, or you can just try your best to go in an intended direction towards rooms and people that you have not checked out yet. It just adds a little more strategic action to the game, and a little more excitement. Of course, you must check off the times, drinks, rooms, and people that you have investigated in order to deduce who is the cake-snatcher. If the rules seem too confusing or complicated, just tweak them- fun is not always achieved by rules set in stone. Our pieces are not top heavy, and we do not really knock them over during gameplay. I do not feel that this game is cheaply made; it is just standard. Briarpatch or Ravensburger games seem no tougher than this game. I do not care that pencils were not included, as I have pencils in my home. My daughter and I have great fun figuring out the culprit, etc....we get to feel like Sherlock Holmes for a minute, just without a pipe or Scotland Yard detectives getting in the way."
0,1,"My daughter has a fear of tornados ever since we watched the wizard of oz.  This little gizmo was great to make them more accessible and less scary.You do need to give the water a bit of rotational momentum to get the tornado ""whirlpool"" started."
1,0,These are fun but are really only test engines that might propel the rocket about 100 feet up. Get a bigger engine for super high launches.
0,1,"These worked great. For the beginner, it was good to not use more powerful engines that will launch the rocket up too high. Great product."
0,1,"We bought these for twoEstes 1491 Taser Launch Setrockets. They work great, and come with everything you need for launching. Recommended."
1,0,"I am currently tutoring two different age groups.  One is learning two letter blends and the other 3 letter blends (CVC words).I throw this into a board game or any kind of a game, and it's like adding in a magic trick for these kids.LOVE THAT I PURCHASED THIS!!!"
0,1,My just turned 5 year old LOVES this game.  We have so much fun making words.  It has upped his reading in just a matter of weeks and he is still in preschool!  I also have a 3 1/2 year old but he isn't quite ready for it yet.  Must be starting to know letter sounds to make words!
0,1,"This is a very creative and educational game.  I love it, but my kids tried to play it once and have not asked to play it again, so I'm wondering how to get them into it again.  Part of the problem is that they found the rules confusing, and part of it is that they are not quite ready for it as far as their spelling skills are concerned.  I think they'll like this game a lot more in a year or so, so perhaps I jumped the gun a bit with my expectations.So, here's the deal.  Buy it and try it, and if the rules with the game don't work for you, make up your own game.  Gnood luck!"
0,1,"The age on my box says 5+. This game is for much older children or for very advanced 5 year olds. If you're looking for a learning resource to teach younger children to read, then this might be good for you. If you're looking for a fun game to play with your child, don't buy this game; you'll be disappointed."
0,1,"I bought this for my 4 year old who is learning to read and he loves it. He's not quite ready to play this game competitively as the rules call for, but we take turns making words with the tiles and he does really well. The game is fun, simple, and helps children as they are learning to read. I'd recommend it."
1,0,"I love this game!  It starts out easy enough for a 5 year old, with the higher levels challenging enough for the adults.  Yet, it isn't so hard that we waste too much time and give up and leave it on the shelf.  Sometimes, you just need to exercise the brain a bit without being overly challenged.  The pieces are also nicely made.  The plastic is smooth with no craggy edges or sharp corners, shaped and weighted to make it all work as it should.  Actually, that is probably one of the best parts of playing this - to have the pieces set up, fall, and clink just right.  I could be particular and wish for a built-in drawer for the cards since the box has gotten ratty, but whatever.  It's a pleasure to play."
0,1,"This, like most ThinkFun games, is a solitary thinking game, but my kids really like it.  To play, you pick a card and set up the game pieces accordingly.  Your goal is to get your man from his starting location to the designated ending location.  He can walk along crates and tip them over to get to the next crate (the tipping is quite gratifying to the kids for some reason).  Once a crate is tipped over, you can't move it, although you may find yourself backtracking over it.  If you are stuck, the answers are printed on the back of each card. When you are finished, toss it into the handy storage bag until the next time you or your kids need an interesting diversion.It is not specifically an educational game, but it does provides practice in visualization, spatial skills, planning a few moves ahead, and thinking!I do wish there was an easy way to get replacement pieces.  We've lost a couple of crates, but can still play most of the cards.All in all, a great game."
1,0,"We purchased this as a Christmas gift for our child.  I was unfamiliar with it but read the box description and looked at the examples on the back of the box.  It seemed like a lot of fun and very straightforward.  Build rows of cards with items from smallest to biggest.  The examples on the box were very easy to follow: Baby, Bathtub, House, Hollywood.  Or, Juice, Pickle, Supermarket, Parking Lot.  Easy and fun?  I actually bought it for children younger than suggested age of 10 since it seemed like a simple game of reading and simple reasoning with a bit of creativity, which should be easy for grade school kids.However, the reality of the cards are very hypothetical and not everything is a tangible object.  That lead to a lot of confusion and frustration.  We actually had to call in Grandpa, who was not playing, to count hands in a ""head down, raise hands"" type of vote.  That's not fun for our kids or the adults.  All in all, a great concept but not what our family was looking for.  We wanted a little more silliness with tangible items that ""could"" fit inside something but never actually would...as in a giraffe in a bathtub.Bottom line, choose your players carefully and now that I understand the game more, I was wrong to buy it for players younger than 10 as the manufacturer suggestd and I, personally, would raise the age to 12."
0,1,"Really fun and inventive, never thought I would try to put moose in the house, just great to play!  Love this game, great for any age!"
0,1,"The good part of this game is that it's clearly suitable for young kids - not every game is, but this one is easy enough for even a very young child to play with no modification of the rules.But there's not too much strategy to the game, and we find when we play that we ultimately all end up with very close to the same scores.The children (aged 5 and 2.5) very rarely request to play this - they mostly prefer games with more strategy, like Sleeping Queens or dominoes. (And Candyland, which has *no* strategy, but I try to discourage that!)Additionally - and all Gamewright games have this problem, as well as the games from many other companies - the cards aren't the best quality. This is on par with the cards from other card games, so I don't mark down for it, but it still is disappointing every time I realize how easily the cards are gonna split. *sigh*"
0,1,"This is a two piece plastic assembly with a removable marshmallow tube. Pump action creates pressure propelling the marshmallow about 15 to 20 feet.Unfortunately, marshmallows (if at room temperature) get stuck frequently. I spent 6 times on the day after Christmas removing marshmallows from the nozzle. It appears that the ammo needs to be perfect in shape and colder than room temperature. I would prefer if this were used outdoors but I could really foresee antpiles everywhere.Aside from the Jams, which stick like glue, this toy is fun for little kids. If it can shoot dog kibble, at least the floors would be cleaned up, after my daughter shoots the ammunition everywhere."
1,0,I bought a power wheels vehicle secondhand and it needed a new battery and charger. I was happy to find both on amazon at a reasonable price. I've been happy with both items as they work as advertised.
0,1,"This is a great charger. The normal power wheels charger takes so long to charge that my son would have to wait an entire day to ride his toy again. With this one battery is charged and the other one is being used. We do use the long charger one when it is feasible, but highly recommend getting the rapid charger for everyone with a power wheels. This is a must have product!"
0,1,"I bought this set mostly for the battery powered Thomas (as it really wasn't much more to buy the set over bp Thomas alone). Our biggest trouble with it were all of the small curves and the way the ascending track pieces worked with battery powered Thomas (they worked fine with most of the other engines except Mavis, but they would still catch occasionally), he would get stuck if you didn't run him toward the ascending piece's female end (even then, occasionally he would get stuck going up instead of getting stuck when going down), it didn't happen every time, but enough that it was a little frustrating.  The little pieces posed a problem because it left a little more extra space between the tracks then the 6"" curves, and occasionally it would catch a wheel. One of the small curves also broke the very first night when dismantling the track (a very small piece chipped off along the grain on the female end).  In the end, this is a GREAT add-on to existing sets, especially if you have the switches and such, but I don't really like it as a stand-alone figure 8 set.  I like the water tower and conductor shed figure 8 sets much, much better."
0,1,"Great set.  My son loves the battery powered Thomas.  Though Thomas doesn't seem to get quite as much juice as his battery powered Percy I bought separately, but he still does a good job.  My son exclusively uses the battery powered engines and hooks up the non-powered engines to them as cars."
0,1,"If you've decided to buy Thomas brand track this is a nice starter set, but you should also invest in some expansion sets like the Freddie Exp Set, the Cross & Switch Exp Pk, Conductors Figure 8 Exp Pk, male & female Track adapter pks.  For Thomas trains, I bought most of mine on ebay new."
0,1,"My son likes playing with this toy now that he can sit up on the green bench and play with the buttons.  When he was younger and not able to sit, we would put him under it and have him kick the bench.  When he was able to kick it hard enough to make it play music, the toy would move across the room because there is no traction on the bottom of it to prevent it from moving.  This is a great toy for when the kids are able to actually play, but not a good toy to use as a kicker."
0,1,"This is not your mother's lite brite (me, being the mother). It's the same creative fun but the flat screen allows for kids to use it on their laps, at desks, just about anywhere. The compartment that holds the pegs is a plus but be careful. If you open it too quickly all the pegs will spill all over. It happened twice to my 5 year old on Christmas.  This set includes some cool picture templates and some blank pages to create your own portrait. I bought this to help with fine motor skills for a kindergartner learning to write. Excellent and an Occupational Therapist reccommended for kids who are learning to write to increase their finger strength."
0,1,"I bought this with fond memories of my childhood lightbright.  I honestly thought my 5 year old son would love this.First, it's really cheaply made.  Thin plastic junk, typical of the toys coming out today.The drawer is convenient, but sticks.  Almost every time we've opened, pegs have gone flying everywhere because of the difficulty in opening the drawer.It is battery operated.  You press the button and it automatically shuts off after 3 minutes.  I'd prefer the electric type to this.It doesn't stand up well, if at all.You can't push a peg in without holding it or propping it against something.  It's just not the toy I remember.  I wouldn't buy this again and I definitely would not give this as a gift."
0,1,"I love this pig so much, that I've purchased one for each of my grandchildren. This will be the 5th baby shower (5th grandchild). The pig is made of a soft rubber and large in size. It won't break, if dropped. I've even suggested writing a name on the bottom so the grandchildren don't get them mixed up. It's adorable!"
0,1,This pig is great. It's super cute and my oldest has it for years. We write their names on the sides since the bandana get's pulled off. Easy to take money out and put in and holds a lot.
0,1,"Schylling makes high-quality toys and I own many of their products. This rubber piggy bank continues their tradition of excellence.However, this bank is either for very young children - which, based on many of the reviews posted here, are babies and toddlers (despite manufacturer recommendations of 3 years and up) - or older children. I do not recommend this bank for the mid-range child, ages 4-8 years.Turns out that my children wanted to see their savings add up. A clear glass piggy bank and a counting jar replaced this otherwise outstanding gift given to both my 4-year old son and 6-year old daughter.For durablity, safety and styling, this is a great product, but for kids who are developing money sense, stick with the traditional glass or see-through models."
0,1,"My 4 year old son really loves this piggy bank. I love that I don't have to worry about him breaking it. I had read from other reviews that the bottom part where you empty the coins out was hard to open, but ours is not too hard at all. I actually wish it were harder to open so my son would have to ask for help whenever he wants to dump out his coins. But it's a cute, durable and pretty good sized little bank."

0,1,Nobody has wanted to deal with it because the directions are ridiculous. Even for adults. It kind of takes the fun out of it because it's exhausting.
0,1,"It's a mystery to me that bundles of legos don't normally come with large baseplates.  Large baseplates such as the ones in this set are necessary to maximize what can be done with legos.The larger the baseplate, the better, I think.  They allow some room between lego structures and objects.  For example, lego trees can be placed around a lego home, and it looks so much better when the home has a yard around it.  Another example is the enjoyment of lego vehicles and spaceships.  These objects look like they have room to run when they're on larger baseplates, and other objects can be placed around them without too much crowding.I recommend these larger baseplates for anybody with 300 or more lego pieces, practically as a requirement."
0,1,I love LEGO sets and these baseplates are very important for those who want to build buildings and such. You need these so your building will have a good foundation and keep everything together. It's nice that LEGO sells this in a bundle and the price is pretty good.
1,0,"Son excited about this toy. Fits him well, hes six. He has a blast bouncing around on this guy. Very easy to blow up,.you need a pump."
0,1,"My son is 5 and loves this. he is a big boy, 70 lbs, and this fits him perfect. I know all these different size balls are confusing. I took a shot at this one and it fits perfect. This ball is very durable, it seems really thick and puncture proof. Has a bit of an odor to it, but it goes away. hope this helps"
0,1,"We bought this for our very energetic 5 year old daughter (who is about 46 inches and 40 lbs).  It is very sturdy and she bounces on it all through the house (driving us a bit crazy).  Things get worse when her 12 year old sister decides to bounce around the house -- it fully supports her (5 ft and 100 lbs) but her larger size makes it really noisy on our wood floors over a basement.  That said, not only the 5 year old loves it, the 12 year old loves it and I should have bought her one as well.  When it is finally warm enough, I think the girls will have a great time outside.  I have friends that purchased ipads and similar items for their kids and looked at this ball and say &#34;why didn't I think of that.&#34;  (Of course, begging the question of why anyone would buy an Ipad for a 5 year old but that is a different issue).  This ball is worth the money.  My older daughter had one of these balls when she was much younger and it was imprinted with Dora or something like that.  It was flimsy and didn't make it more than a few months.  This ball will last!"
0,1,"For reference, this is the second 1,000 piece puzzle my wife and I have worked on in a row.  The first was a cheap no-name puzzle which I will compare this ""premium"" puzzle to with pros and cons.  Here they are:Pros:* Linen-matte finish.  This finish is much better at deflecting lighting glare then the cheap puzzle's matte finish was.* Piece quality.  Each piece was solid and felt durable enough to handle multiple puzzle assembly and teardown cycles.  Unlike the cheap puzzle I didn't come across any pieces that were splitting out of the box.* Very good picture resolution.  None of the picture details are smeared into an unrecognizable mess.* Container.  The box teh puzzle comes in is additionally very durable feeling.* Interlocking.  Pieces fit together really well.Glow in the dark.* Glow actually works pretty well and looks cool.  It also doesn't detract from the ability to discern which piece goes where, and can sometimes help.Cons:* Picture is obscurred.  Because of the feature blurb on the cover (which is incentally on the other side of the box unlike what is pictured) there isn't a good sized un-obscurred view of puzzle to be had.  And unlike the cheap puzzle, and half size mini portrait insn't included to help you figure out teh puzzle.  This is really the only knock I have on this set.Debatable:* Unique piece feature.  Didn't really have a problem with this not being a part of cheap set.* Summary:This is a great puzzle, small gripe in that I just wish that is came with an un-obscurred view of it somewhere."
0,1,"The first thing you notice about this premium puzzle is the quality of the pieces.  Having never worked a Ravensburg it was a treat to see quality cut pieces that fit together well and are made of quality cardboard.  The photo quality is vividly excellent and is printed on an anti-glare matte surface.  We enjoyed working the puzzle as a family and the added fun of seeing the glow in the dark feature added to the excitement.  My only minor gripe is that the box doesn't show what the puzzle looks like when it is glowing the in the dark.  I think since glow-in-the-dark quality can vary per product, it should be shown so customers know if it is cool enough to justify the higher price."
0,1,"There just isn't really much to say about a puzzle, ... but let's try anyway =)TheEvening in Rome 1000 Piece Starline Glow-in-The-Dark Puzzlewas a nice, decent sized puzzle (27""x20"" fits on pretty much every table). My wife quite enjoyed putting it together. The glow-in-the-dark feature is also kind of neat. My wife liked the ""soft click"" aspect of the puzzle pieces, she remarked that putting the puzzle together wasn't as noisy as others she has put together in the past.  She also said that this particular photo-as-puzzle had nice color gradients, making it easier to put together, and not take a huge amount of time to do parts like the sky.I have posted 2 photos of the completed puzzle, to allow you to see the completed puzzle to scale.4 stars."
0,1,"I bought this for my 3-4 year old, and I think I've now decided to buy another for myself (age: 39)!  I started with a simple toy bow and arrow (suction cup tips) and it simply sucked.  A friend had one of these MONKEY BUSINESS SPORTS SUREFIRE COMPOUND BOW X2, and my son loved it.  Came home and ordered from AMAZON.  We have had it over a week, and it still has not lost its appeal!  Only one small fault so far, and I""m not sure how it happened.  One of the arrows lost its ""feathers"" on the back.  If the price falls... I will seriously be buying another one!  I hope AMAZON will start carrying the replacement arrows soon.  That would be ideal as well!  Highly recommend!!!!"
0,1,"I bought this set because it was cheap and I wanted the figure and motorcycle for my police force. This set comes with one officer figure that has a very detailed printed head and torso. He is equipped with a white helmet and a gray walkie-talkie. The motorcycle itself is an extremely simple build (most of the motorcycle being one frame piece) and when finished it looks genuinely like a real police motorcycle. The motorcycle is equipped with a kick-stand and a place for the walkie-talkie.

0,1,"I teach special education, and I've ordered about 10 of these puzzles ranging from 60 to 300 pieces. These are excellent puzzles for my mentally and physically challenged people. The large, bright colored pieces make it fun and much easier to put together than the puzzles with 500 to 1000 (which are virtually impossible for many of my students). Many of my students are so pleased with themselves that by the end of the period they have accomplished something really grand by completing one."
0,1,We like it and don't have any complaints.  Although not my favorite Melissa & Doug puzzle we had fun putting this together
0,1,"There isn' enough variety of peices in this set. my son tried to build stuff with it, but there aren't enough roof peices or smaller peices. Just tons of big peices. I tried gettting creative and playing with them with him, but I soon realized that you just really can't put anything creative together with the lack of peices. I ended up donating the whole set to good will."
0,1,"We bought this Timbers building set for our 2 and 3 year olds for Christmas last year.  Just recently (now 3 and 4) they have really begun to love building and are doing great building things with this set all by themselves.  This set costs so much less than the Lincoln Logs brand and do the exact same things!  We love them and plan on getting another set for the boys this Christmas so they can build ""a town with a fence"" (what they always ask to build!)"
0,1,"Bought these last Christmas for my 4 yr old son who really had no idea what a Lincoln Log was, but I thought it would be something he could use to build ""pens"" for all his toy plastic animals with.  Much to my disappoinment, he could have cared less about the logs.But for the past few weeks (he's almost 5 now) he has been digging them out and building all sorts of forts, sheds, houses, castles, you name it!  He really seems to enjoy them now.  These aren't as well made as the original Lincoln Logs, but what seems to be these days?  But they will do.  I find the grooves aren't as deep, so the logs sometimes just don't fit or stay together that well.  Only other downside is they don't come in any sort of good box that can double as storage, so I had to go out and buy a container with a snap lid to contain all 300 pieces."
0,1,"Buy the Lincoln logs.  Yes, you will pay more for name brand, but they are better constructed and stay together much better than this cheap nock off brand.  I bought these to save a few bucks and it was a mistake.  The roofs do not fit together and there is a large space at the top.  Because the logs are rounded, they slip apart unlike the Lincoln Logs which are shaped like hexegons and stay together much better.  Spend a few extra bucks and save on your kids crying when their cabin falls down."

0,1,"My daughter is obsessed with trumpets and trombones.Since she was very young we decided to start with a harmonica and a recorder.I didn't expect much from this recorder.  Because of such, I don't think I was too disappointed in the sound.  It's not what you would say pitch perfect.  Then again, my child at the time was almost two so I wasn't expecting her to use this item much. Actually, she kept trying to play it like a flute but I digress.Melissa and Doug's strength is not in its musical instruments.I would recommend holding off on this item and looking for something else.I didn't give it a super low score because my daughter still uses it and has increased her imagination with this toy.  She pretends it is a flute sometimes.  Sometimes she pretends it's a trumpet.7 months ago, I noticed that my daughter has learned to take the recorder and pull it apart.  The mouthpiece now comes off and slides back on.  It makes it easier to clean up when her friends drool into it but I don't think that was supposed to happen. (The breaking off of the mouthpiece, not the drooling.)"
0,1,"Great first set, I had fun performing the tricks and then the kids easily were able to duplicate the &#34;magic&#34; themselves. Fun to see their imagination and creativity flourish."
0,1,"as advertised.  excellent craftsmanship, sturdy, easy to handle.  My son is homeschooled and is autistic.  We use this every day to learn the value of items, counting, addition, subtraction and play time.  Wonderful buy and well worth the price.  ships fast"
0,1,I got this for my son to play store with. I like that the money looks real and as he gets older he can learn with it as well. It comes with a good amount of money too. We just opened it not too long ago though so can't really comment on the quality of that one. So far though it is doing good after a few weeks! It is annoying though because it doesn't have a lid to the box. That's why it lost one star for me.
1,0,Very good quality.  Would purchase again.  We love Melissa and Doug.  Always stands up well to regular kid play.  Would recommend to a friend!
0,1,"My 6 year old grand daughter received a real cash register for her birthday and this was the perfect supplement to help her learn about money, coin identification, and coin values as she makes change and plays ""store."""

0,1,"There is no other play money on earth better than this set. I only gave it 4 stars because it does NOT come with a cover. A cover would have made this a 10 star item, it's definitely a hassle if it ever tops over. I would recommend this product to all ages, except small children whereas you must be careful with the coins."
1,0,"This is another wonderful piece by Calico critters.  I have gotten my nieces addicted to these play sets, and I am glad as they inspire imagination.  The girls will spend hours together making up little stories about the different critters.The set is lovely, but beware there are lots of very tiny pieces, so if your child likes to put things in their  mouth, this may not be the toy for you.  Everyone else...this is a wonderful set worth every penny."
0,1,MY 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER LOVES ALL HER CRITTERS.  THE NURSERY SET IS ONE OF HER FAVORITE THINGS TO PLAY WITH.
1,0,"This turned out to be a favorite birthday gift, for our steering wheel-obsessed 12 month old. As others have mentioned, the sounds are not too loud or obnoxious (nothing like the toys we reluctantly wind up hiding). Our baby even imitates the wheel's different sounds! The music is adorable and the blinkers actually work. I have caught my other kids playing with it, even the older ones had to try it out - it's just so cute!"
0,1,I would have given it more stars if the track didn't stop working. It should be able to withstand the abuse of a 2 yr old. I only kept it because of the cool sounds.
0,1,"I bought this board, thinking my 2 and 4 year old would use it!  However, since it arrived, it has just been occupying space (quite bulky) and the kids continue to use their wedgits on the floor!"
0,1,My daughter has a hard time with the conventional ideas of math. These have been so great to help reinforce what she has learned.
0,1,"If I had a group of kids to entertain and I had to pick one toy to use, this would be it.  It has been one of my best toy purchases ever.  Whenever my boys have friends over, young or old, this toy is brought out.  It is a lot of fun.  My 3yr old and 6yr old boys really have fun playing TOGETHER with this toy.  Who would have thought excercising could be so much fun.  Just don't tell them that it is excercise! You will not be disappointed."
0,1,"my girls were so happy to get these. the kindergartener knew exactly what they were from using them in school. they jumped right in and started counting, adding, and building with them."
0,1,"This lego set is great for toddlers/preschoolers.  Considering the high price of Thomas the train toys, I think this is actually worth its price.  We got it for our 3-yr-old son who loves Thomas and loves playing with the duplo legos.  We also got the large box of duplo legos, which was really necessary to give him a chance to really get creative.  He makes up some interesting trains, but I think it's only because he has so many legos to work with.  So if this is your child's only duplo legos, you might not be as satisfied with the 'playing' results unless you purchase a small box of duplos to go with it."
1,0,"The Thomas set comes with 16 pieces of track, while most of the other train and accessory packs only come with a few pieces.  You have to either start with this set, or buy the more expensive all inclusive set, which is at least double this one in price, but if you were to get this one and all the add on sets, the large set would save you some cash, and net you a lot of track.I bought this set and then found come Duplo City train track packs, which came with 6 more pieces of straight track.  I believe all of the track in this set is curved, so getting the straight add-on packs gives you a lot of track layout options (the circle this set makes is pretty small).  My son enjoys building and rebuilding the station pieces, but his favorite is laying out the track.  I think the price I paid for this set and two track packs was perfect, and it's just enough pieces to keep track of them.  He only likes to play with Thomas (even though this set does come with two trains), so I don't really need the extra trains and buildings, as it's just more clutter around the house!Overall, anyone with children who love trains should enjoy this set.  Also, it teaches them about building, as even the trains need to put togther.  We have the wooden Thomas table and train set, but he still likes this one and spends a lot of time playing with it, so I wouldn't hesitate buying this if you think the wooden set is enough.  Kids can never have too many train sets!!!"
1,0,"I must echo the statements of most previous reviewers--This is a great easel.  However, many complained about the magnetic letters that accompanied it.  Step 2 must have been listening, because I was suprised to discover that the letters are now foam with an entire magnetic backing.  Although the Melissa and Doug letters that I ordered (in anticipation of sub-par letters) are superior, these letters were definately satisfactory.  They are, however, on the small side and not suitable for young toddlers.  In closing, I highly recommend this easel for any budding artist."
0,1,"Oh my gosh, this is absolutely wonderful, real looking and about 3 ft tall!!!!  My 11 yr old animal crazy granddaughter will go NUTS!  Cheetah is her favoite animal!  It was almost double the price at Toys R Us and this is a steal!!!  So realistic that my husband wonders if she will be able to sleep with it in her room!!!  The eyes are amazing!"
1,0,"The absolute best way to learn chess!!!  Whether you are 5 or 105 this games simplifies the rules enough for anyone to play.  Once you learn the basics, you are on your way to becoming a pro!!  My eight year old and I learned to play so that my eleven year old would have some competition.  My eight year old now loves chess so much that she taught her Grandma how to play.  The only downfall to this game is that my kids want to play all the time!!!  Seriously, a must have in your family game shelves!!!"
0,1,"My son was interested in chess (or as he calls it, ""chest"") about the time he turned four.  I tried to teach him myself, but that failed miserably.  He could not understand how any of the pieces moved, even when we isolated them and I let him move the pieces the way they were supposed to move.  We saw this game on Amazon and he put it on his wish list.  We then bought it for him for Christmas.  He is over 4 1/2 now and thought that I might have the same issues as before when we played this game.  This was not the case.  The cards have illustrations of how pieces move and I think with him being a visual person, help him out.  The cards are also color coded by piece which helped him pick up on what piece to move very quickly.  I helped him set up the pieces and we started playing with me telling him the rules along the way (when I took his first piece, he thought I was cheating, but was happy again when he took one of my guys on the next turn).  I coached him on where he should put his pieces and why, but ultimately let him decided where to place them.  I won the first game pretty easily thanks to where my pieces were positioned.  However, he won the second game thanks to better strategizing and some bad  luck with the cards on my end.  We only played two games, but he got a good grasp of how to play.  He still was a little confused on how knights moved and how pawns took pieces, but I would say this was still a huge success overall.Besides teaching my kid how to play chess in a fun way, I do like the fact that you do not have to worry or think too much in this game thanks to the card system.  You need to almost turn off that mindset of thinking multiple moves in advance because you may not get the opportunity to make those moves if the cards do not come.  I also noticed that in both games I played, one of us was able to advance a pawn all the way to the other side of the board.  The ease of which this was done adds a new strategic element for future games.  Overall, I highly recommend this game to everyone!FYI, I gave this game four stars in durability since you are dealing with cards and young people who tend to bend up cards easily."
1,0,My 5 year old son said that he wanted to learn to play chess and a friend strongly recommended this version.  I am amazed and so happy that we bought it---I don't know/never learned how to play chess and now I'm learning right along with my son.  It is wonderful--and there are 3 levels so that as you learn/understand more you can also start to implement a strategy and get you ready for playing without the cards.  I HIGHLY recommend this game.
0,1,"This really teaches you how to play chess. It shows exactly where the pieces need to be set up. Once you learn the rules, you can flip the board over and play a regular game. This was a great gift for my 6 year old son!"
0,1,"I love this game for beginners.  My 5 yr old and 7 yr old play often.  After only 1 time, they are able to set up the board and play alone. The know what moves each piece makes, except they are a little fuzzy on the pawns.  Drawing the cards makes the game interesting and makes it less overwhelming for the kids to decide which piece to move.  Great variation and introduction to Chess."
0,1,"With all the reviews i tried these out.  I like that they are eco friendly and they are vibrant colors, but the shape I don't love as much as I expected to.  Either kids are learning how to hold writing devices (be it crayons, pencils, markers etc) properly at younger ages or something but when my 20 month old and again at 2 tried using these to color, it was truly awkward for him to use.  I'm not sure how this agape is supposed to do anything for them other than messy attempts at coloring.  He was less than thrilled, and so am I after spending the money.  To add, I don't find them very easy to clean off walls or clothes as others mentioned they were.  I would stick to their set of fat standard shaped crayons instead.  Personally I like the Pkolino crayons much better, and those you can actually clean off things."
0,1,Great crayons!  I got these for my son who is 17 mths old so I wouldn't worry so much about him putting them in his mouth for a sec and I like that they are square and he can hold it at any angle to color.  They smell good & the colors are very vibrant.  I would recommend for anyone.
0,1,Nephew loved the gift.
0,1,Hot wheels cars. Great as always. No complaints. My 2.5 year old son loves them. They are very durable and solid.
0,1,It was great getting all these cars in one package. Hunter loved them and had races all over the living room. It's fun to watch kids have car races with hot wheels.
1,0,"Wow, awesome! The 2 year old's eyes lit up when this was opened. He was really excited! 20 Cars! At one time! This was a very GOOD purchase. Hot Wheels cars rock!"
0,1,"Purchased for a 4 year old. Hot Wheels are always an instant favorite and this set does not disappoint. Highly recommend purchasing this, even if you do not give all at once, you can always give a few at a time."
0,1,"Thomas is to light to help a child walk, and the handle falls off very easy.  It is a good ride on for my son, because he is very tall.  For a small child though it would take some growing to ride Thomas because he is so wide.  He has some cute sounds, but he choo choo's non stop while he is being moved.  Don't buy Thomas if you are looking for a good push toy."
0,1,"Nice set of play money. Wish the bills were a little larger, but they'll work for pretend play for my kids."
0,1,"This was a gift for my nephew. He loves cowboys. The gun looks very nice, and opens to put in the ring caps."
0,1,This gun is a little heavy and would think it would be hard for a smaller child to hold.  Bought it for my 6 year old for Christmas and it turned out to be a huge hit.  I remember this gun when I was little but mine was more cheaply built and only a 6 shot.  This gun is a 12 shot.  Do not buy the cap refills that is recommended when pulling this gun up.  The refills are for 6 shot and will not fit.  I also could not find them on Amazon and had to look elsewhere.  With that being said I would still buy this gun again.  Plan on buying one for my nephew for his birthday.
0,1,"Nice, authentic toy replica.  Feels sturdy,.  My issue is the rubber piece near the trigger hammer.  This piece is there to hold the chamber in place after opening / closing to load caps.  It becomes warped somewhat quickly, and then with firing the gun won't stay closed."
0,1,I bought a cowgirl costume for my 5-year-old granddaughter. I bought a sturdy sheriff badge and the Big Tex Holster set. My granddaughter loves the whole outfit. My daughter tells me the gun is quite sturdy.
0,1,"Although the holster is made somewhat cheap and flimsy, the pistol itself is very well made and is a heavy die cast piece. It takes 12 shot ring caps #914. It is quote loud and smokes a little when fired, so it is definitely an outside toy. The only negative I have to say about it is that the caps are easy to load, but removing them once they are all spent is quote a chore. You have to dig them out with a knife or tweezers or similar object. Easy to load, hard to unload. Otherwise it is a great toy."
1,0,"I bought this for my 4 and 6 year olds for Christmas thinking it would be really cute.  They wanted them desperately.  After opening it they were both really disappointed.  My 6 year old asked if she could exchange it for something else. You have to press really hard to get the pony to make the sucking sounds with the bottle, it frustrated them both.  I really thought it would do more!  It only has a couple of sayings and it just doesn't interact much at all.  I think for the price it was a rip off I can't believe it cost so much I truly expected more than this.  I strongly recommend the Fur Real Friends toys they do so much for the same price my kids LOVE them."
0,1,I bought this just for the Count. Haven't actually tried it cause it sounds a bit wonky. The Count is Awesome though. Definitely worth having just for the Meaple.
0,1,"We are big fans ofCarcassonne Basic Game, and think it is great for two players.  So, I was not sure this two-player version would be either necessary or worthwhile. I'm happy to say I was pleasantly surprised on both counts.  Carcassonne: The Castle is fun variation of the game with some interesting new mechanics. New strategy components include trying to get the wall tiles, new luck component includes the wall tiles being drawn and placed at random so you never know what you are going to get.If I had to chose one or the other I would definitely getCarcassonne Basic Game, it is still in print, works great for 2 or more players (whereas this one only works with 2), and has tons of expansions.  But, if you like regular Carcassonne and often play with just two players (and have a little extra cash to spend on a good variation), this adds some worthwhile new elements that we have really enjoyed."
0,1,"Ever since I first laid eyes on her...her soft brown skin, flowing blue dress, long silky hair..I instantly fell in love! She played a ver nice, important role in the movie, and I was glad to hear that she has her very own doll --- HER VERY OWN B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L DOLL!!! I highly recommend buying her. And if my review doesn't persuade you, do your own eyes?(This is the part where you look at the picture and sigh at her marvelousness.)"
0,1,"i knew this ""barbie"" wasn't the same as the rayla in the movie.  i knew that she was darker from the other reviews, but that's why i bought it.  if you want to show your small one that there are multi colored people, or in this case dolls, out there... buy this... this will spice up your group of barbies."
1,0,i believe this was my oldest daughter's first barbie.  i don't remember how much i paid for it but i certainly know it wasn't more than fifty bucks.  this is the oldest barbie in the house and the most played with.  she's a very beautiful barbie.
0,1,"I purchased this toy for my then 9 month old granddaughter.  She is 1 years old now and still enjoys spending some time with this toy. She always has a big grin when one of the sesame street pals pop up and sing.  The only draw back to this toy is that she can pull up the lid to the pals without having to use the bottons.  Since she found out that by pulling with all her might on the lids they open up and music and singing begins.  She doesn't need to use the associated buttons for this to work.  Anyway,  she gets enjoyment from this and she does learn cause and effect so I give this a good report.  Maybe now that she is older she may start to use the bottons.  I would reduce the minimum age to 6 months."
1,0,"The only downsides are:  (1) not all of the pieces actually trigger the music.  About 2 of the pieces are duds and do not play music when placed in their setting.  (2) each one that does work plays the SAME song.  He loves that, because as he puts a piece in place, he starts singing and nodding his head to the music he anticipates will play -- he knows what it will be because it is all the same.  It gets on my nerves, though. I was hoping that with each different instrument, there would be a different song.  There's not - same song, just different instrument (or a non-working instrument)."
0,1,"I am not a fan to all the toys that make sounds, and through my daughter's therapy I have learned that it is best for us to take the batteries out. This has been a great toy for my daughter, she makes believe with the instruments before putting them into the correct place."
1,0,
1,0,"Agh!  I feel cheated LOL.  I bought this used from Craigslist back when Amazon had it for WELL over 100 bucks and I'm seeing today it's way less than that plus free shipping!Seriously, you can't beat that, you could't even make it for close to that.It's the perfect height for a 2 year old though we bought it prematurely for our DD when she was just over 1 because it was just so cute, nice vivid colors.Only issue is the side curtain walls (not the red curtains on front) are secured with dowels on the base of the unit and if you bump the curtain the dowels are always popping out so we will need to glue them in."
0,1,kids love it have had a great time picking out where relatives live and places we have gone on vacation
1,0,"I love turtles, and my kids love sitting and jumping on this turtle.  It ames a beating and hasn't ripped open.  It's also very attractive.  Such a great stuffed turtle.  I would certainly buy again."
0,1,Cute and looks just like the picture online.  Would recommend to anyone.  The item fits right into our playroom perfectly.
0,1,"This is an amazing product for the price.  It is huge, beautifully made and so soft. It is so much nicer than I expected.  I was a little worried about buying something like this online, but I am so pleased. Would recommend it to all penquin lovers!"
0,1,"This is a very cool bird.  And big.  This definitely adds to the cool factor.  I have a kid just in love with penguins so we were very pleased to find that this is made with great quality fur, stuffed enough to maintain original shape, but still snuggly."
0,1,"My 4-year-old son has gone through My First LeapPad and a Leapster without showing much interest. My in-laws got him the V-Smile for his birthday with some reservations (they had gotten him the others as well!) but he absolutely ADORES this thing! He has the Buzz Lightyear and the Lion King games, both of which he likes. He has begun to learn math (4+1=5) while playing Buzz Lightyear and truly loves playing.However, like any other toy, it truly all depends on your child, but I whole-heartedly approve of this one, and so does my son!"
0,1,"We have progressed from Leap Pads (with every book) to Leapster and amazingly, while looking for a system that would travel well and keep our 5 and 7 year old sons busy -we broke down and got the VSmile.I must admit that our sons were initially interested in the Leapster as we don't ""DO"" video games in our family, but they seemed to quickly lose interest and so dust is collecting.  However, we splurged on the VSmile system (with all available Smartridges) and took it traveling and WOW!  Both boys can manage without assistance and their friends all wait to take turns.  I have had kids up to age 12 waiting in line to play these ""games"".As anti-video-game folks we heartily approve of the learning aspects of this system, and are so glad we didn't discount this as being for younger kids only.  If it withstands the next few years of abuse, we may have to pry it from our sons to pass along to thier younger cousin!"
0,1,"We have the original V-Smile console that hooks to the TV and the boys love it! We decided to buy the v-smile pocket so they could play anywhere. The screen was blurry when the games were moving. We also had trouble with the system freezing up frequently. We would have to push the reset button on the back to un-freeze it. This is frustrating when in the middle of a game because then you have to start over. We returned ours and luckily got a full refund from the store we purchased it from. While we love the original V-smile, I would recomend the leapster handheld (from Leapfrog) over the V-smile pocket. We have had no issues with the leapster system."
0,1,"My 3-yr-old son received this for Christmas.  I was a little worried that it would be too difficult for him, but he figured it out right away!  We had to purchase some new games for a younger age level because the one that came with it is a little difficult for him, but we love it!!  We love that we can hook it up to our DVD in the car and to the TV.  I highly recommend purchasing rechargeable batteries-it is worth the investment, and the AC adapter is best when at home.  The picture is not blurry as one reviewer said-my son prefers to play it on the v-smile screen at times.  The games teach different concepts as well.  I am glad we purchased this versus the regular v-smile because it is portable.  We also purchased a video camera carrying case, which is perfect to carry the player, games, adapter, and TV cable in."
1,0,"This toy is really great.  My baby and toddler love it.  It teaches cause and effect and has fun lights and sounds.  Each opening sends the ball down a different path, so there's always something new to see each time."
0,1,"This was a great toy when my son was young, it kept him busy for hours. Then it was passed down and used over and over and loved by all. highly recommended for those young developing minds"
0,1,"I bought this at a thrift shop for my daughter when she was about 18 months old. She adored it then, and even though she's really far too ""advanced"" for it now (2 1/2 years old), she still loves it.This is a very well made, durable, colorful dinosaur with sound effects that won't drive you up a wall. The little ""rawr!"" is adorable. Like previous reviewers mentioned, balls do get stuck in one of the holes, but I never even noticed it until people mentioned it here-- it just didn't bug us. Maybe because my daughter was older when she began using it, she just fished the balls out herself, no big deal.To me, it's as cute as it appears, and a solid purchase for either a boy or a girl."
0,1,"My one year old will play with this for hours.  I think the recommended age should be a bit higher than six months though--she had no interest in it until she was older.  Once my daughter could pick up the balls and put them in the holes, it became fun for her."
0,1,This is one of the cutest toys I've seen in a long time. The kids really like it. It holds their interest for a long time which is really good.
0,1,"The toy is really cute and looks like fun, but my son won't play with it. He got it when he was 9 months, so I'm hoping that when he's a little older he'll get into it. My son quickly figured out how to push the little buttons inside each hole to start the sounds, but doesn't care about putting the balls into them. He was bored after having the toy a week. For as large as the toy is there is no ball storage for the rollarounds and limited sounds, so you hear the same thing over and over. It now collects dust in my son's room. Wouldn't waste your money."
0,1,We have had no problems with balls getting stuck as other people have described and my son just loves it. The lights and soft sounds are just perfect! I hate those loud toys that are out right now and they can damage your child's hearing.. this toy isn't like that. It is very cute and very fun! My four year old even enjoys playing with it along with his baby brother!!!
1,0,"I received this used from a friend and at first thought it may not go over so well, but my 11 month old loves it! He just learned how to put the balls in the holes and he will sit for a long time playing with this toy. Plus, he loves rolling the balls around on the table. The cat loves to watch the balls move around and play with the balls herself!I agree that the middle slot is poorly made and the balls get stuck in there a lot but it doesn't seem to bother my son."
1,0,"My 11 month old daughter received this toy for Christmas. She LOVES it!! She loves to sit down next to it... turn on the ""radio"", and dance. She loves sitting on it and pushing her legs to go... and she loves using the walker part.This is such a great toy!! I recommend it to everyone!"
0,1,"We received this toy as a first birthday present, and from day one my girls were playing with the animals, and still prefer the animals over the actual zoo.  They are bright and colorful, and the set and playmat seems sturdy to me.  I saw a recent price of $99 which seems quite expensive - I believe the person who gave my girls this set as a gift paid around $40 (so shop around)."
1,0,My 2 yr old just got this for her birthday and loves it. There is enough with this toy to keep her interested in the variety of animals. The animals sounds are fun and matching option (can you find the animal that makes this sound?) are very educational. There is a peek-a-boo gopher or groundhog that pops up for some extra fun. Also a bird fits nicely on the swing and makes for more make believe activities. Fisher Price always does a great job with their Little People collection. The animals and the playset and mat are very durable and easy to wipe clean.
0,1,I bought this toy for my nephew. He really loved the animal and he learns a lot with it.It is a perfect toy for kid and very educational.
0,1,This is a fun system.  Your kids will be dancing and singing all day long.  Highly recommended.
0,1,"My five year old daughter wanted this for Christmas in the worst way, so ""Santa"" left it under the tree for her on Christmas  morning! After reading previous reviews, I thought we were going to be disappointed in this item. But, she absolutely loves it! To my suprise, the picture that comes up on my tv is as clear as a bell. And it was easy for her to learn how to operate the different features. The whole family had a blast with it (adults included!) We've also connected it to the vcr and was able to record the special effects as well as her singing into the mike. I would recommend this to anyone considering to buy it for their little one(s)..."
0,1,"My daughter received this as a 1st birthday present.  She is totally uninterested in it.  I keep it out, just in case she changes her mind, but so far it is a fail.  Save your $."
0,1,"My son loves these Fisher Price toys and received the goldfish for his first birthday.  He has fun with it, but it's not as entertaining to him as some of the other Peek-a-Blocks toys he has.  The fish has some shining scales on one side and some holes on the other side, both of which my son likes to poke.  The top of the fish has a flat spot to stack blocks and a green handle.  My son doesn't use either of these which surprises me because he really likes carrying the Peek-a-Blocks Tumblin' Giraffe around by its handle.The goldfish comes with four blocks which my son likes to play with - a swiveling octopus, a seastar that slides along a post, a clam that opens and closes and a sand castle with rattling colored balls.  The blocks fit into an opening near the top of the fish and they fall on a button which will start a tune playing.  Pushing down on the tail of the fish opens the mouth so the blocks fall out while another tune plays.  The mouth of the fish does not close all the way; it still has an opening so fingers and hands do not get pinched.There are two things that my son and I both seem slightly displeased about.  If the goldfish is upright, only two or three blocks fit in it.  The first two blocks can fall in such a way that they are stacked right up to the opening.  If it doesn't happen with two blocks, it always happens with three and the fourth block will only fit if I tip the fish backward and shake it around to reposition the blocks.  Also, only the first block my son puts in will play a tune.  Subsequent blocks do not fall hard enough to press the button.  My son really likes to be rewarded by the music after he gets a block in, so I press the button on the back (which normally gets pressed when the mouth is opened) to play him a tune for getting the second and third blocks in the goldfish.Overall, my son has fun with this goldfish and plays with it a bit each day."
0,1,"I think the Bratz one is more detailed and realistic. Don't get me wrong, i LOVE My Scene. But i am not sure 'bout this, because it doesn't really look like a limo, it looks like a truck. And no one can drive this limo. Other than that this limo is pretty cool!"

The doll is so much more beautiful when you see it in person than in pictures.  I think that Meygan is overall the best doll in the Midnight Dance collection because of her fantastic outfit and beautiful hair, but Fianna is a VERY close second!  I also love the packaging for the MD dolls.  The boxes are pretty and I love the ribbon handles!  The dolls look so good in their boxes that I haven't wanted to take them out of the boxes yet.  Midnight Dance is one of the best, most creative Bratz collections and I hope MGA comes out with more fantastic dolls like this in the future!"

0,1,"I got this for my oldest--not sure how old he was at the time. He started reading at 27 months. He loved this toy, and I loved how educational it was. It helped him learn how to spell those words. I'm pretty sure he already knew how to read all those words before he got the toy. He enjoyed sorting the letters (by letter and/or by color). It didn't take long at all for him to outgrow it, though. His younger siblings have hardly touched it--unless it's to dig through a pile of letters and spread them through the house."
1,0,"My 3.5 year old enjoys this puzzle very much. He matches the letter puzzle pieces into the words, he knows most of the photos by name so when he builds the word he sees how ""Frog"" is spelled. A very good learning tool. My only problem with it is that there isn't a cover to keep all the letter pieces together. I store them in a gallon zipper bag and fold it down and they still fit in the alotted letter area and they don't go flying everywhere when my son takes it down from the shelf :-)"
0,1,"We bought several different Melissa and Doug toys and we love them but on all of them, only after a week of play, the paint is coming off various pieces. On the letters, I can already see white where the red paint used to be on this toy. I'm disappointed, however, I surmise given the lead-paint scare last year that perhaps the company switched paint products and they are just not as durable but safe. I still caution, as your child may end up putting paint chips in their mouth. Or getting it on their hands. I'm going to write to the company to ask about their lack of paint durability; as with three toys and only a week's worth of play I should expect better."
0,1,"My 4 year old son loves this toy.  He got it when he was 3 almost 4, for Christmas last year.  It's really great for a young child that is showing interest in letters and simple spelling.  He's learning how to spell these simple words just from playing with it!  I'm quite pleased with this toy/puzzle set."
0,1,"No lid makes this toy hard to keep together! We only use this for school time and then it goes back on the shelf. Would have loved to lids to this one for the letters and one for the cards. Would have thought they would have thought that one though. With all, that said it does help with beginning readers and kids will play with it when given the choice"
0,1,This is a great toy for learning how to spell and read ! All the Melissa & Doug products are built so sturdy.
0,1,"I was with my grandson, who will be 4 next month, today when he brought out the Melissa and Doug See & Spell.  I had not seen this before and was interested to see how he immediately got into finding the correct letter for the board he was using.  He has been getting quite good at identifying capital letters, so it was nice he had something that enouraged him to practice the lower case ones.  In addition to finding the correct letter, he and his mother talked about what word he was spelling.  He also announced what color each letter was.  This is definitely a fun way to work on learning to identify the lower case letters and to work on beginning spelling and reading."
0,1,"I am a big fan of Melissa & Doug toys/products but this one was not a hit in my household. While I like the idea which is the reason I bought it, here are some negatives that I see:- Depending on the age of the child (mine was 3 when using it), it's easy to associate the picture on the &#34;card&#34; with the word being spelled. So, it doesn't really aid in reading or spelling.- The letter pieces are small and can be cumbersome to take care of.- There is no box for the letters, no cover for them either. This can be super annoying since they have a tendency to make a mess- It keeps the interest of my kids for a mere 5-7minutes. Not long enough!"
0,1,Melissa and Doug's version of SEE & SPELL is fantastic! This is the kind of toy that you will pass down from child to child. This is a must have for parents who want their children to have fun whilst they learn!
0,1,My two and a half year old twin boys love this toy. We have owned it for a few months now and it is still a favourite.I have been surprised by both their attention span when playing with the see and spell and with the improvement in their letter recognition. It also appears to be a great introduction to some simple words. It has enough letters for them to be able to play with the toy at the same time and there are enough words for them to share.I bought this hoping to increase their interest in words and speech and it has certainly met my expectations.
0,1,My daughter received this for her fifth b-day she absoultely loves it we have it in her room against the wall you do need to do this but its wonderful cinderella appears in the mirror its magical for any little princess even 1 1/2 year old little princes as well we love it.
0,1,"Once you get past the really annoying voice, this vanity is 100% adorable. It isn't made very well and the smaller stickers are really hard to put on, but once you get past the frustration and see your little princess light up with joy as she plays with it, it makes it all worth it. The only issue I would have with durability is the tiny little plastic stool that comes with it. Good luck seating a child that weighs more than 40lbs on that tiny fragile seat! Also, watch the weight on the vanity itself. I set it up with small pumpkin gourds sitting on the table and cinderella's light up slippers next to them with Cinderella's tiara, etc all around and noticed it sunk down just a bit. Any more weight and i'm sure it would have broke - It did make for a great presentation at the ""princess party/ball"" though. :) Overall, this is an adorable piece to add to your little princess's room so long as it is handled with care and appreciation."
0,1,If you are a &#34;board game geek&#34; you should get this game! It is a lot of fun to play. It requires strategy and is very entertaining.
0,1,"I will not go in depth reviewing this item as there are already so many and very descriptive reviews on this item. All i can further add is that this game is a must for Board game lovers, it is also a nice family game to have to play with the kids and the game has good variability in game play that keep you entertained no matter how many times you play it."
0,1,"Power Grid is a game where your goal is to supply power to all the cities in your network by buying power plants and resources to power the plants as well as keeping enough money to place your cities down on the map.The game can take a fair amount of time, as with most Euro games, so expect to play the game for at least 2 hours.The parts of the game are all very well made with wooden parts rather than plastic parts.The game mechanics can be a bit confusing at first but you will catch on quickly. The game is played in different phases and the player order changes depending on what part of the phase you are currently playing. Sometimes it will go starting player to last player and other times you will go from last player to starting player, like when buying resources. This allows the person in last place the opportunity to get resources at the cheap while the player in first place is required to buy their resources at the higher prices.Overall this is a very good game and is highly recommended. It is in the top 10 on BoardGameGeek and is a lot of fun when playing with a group of experienced gamers. I wouldn't really introduce this game to new players until they have played some other ""Lighter"" games like Ticket to Ride or Settlers of Catan."
0,1,"This tunnel is very colorful, sturdy, and inviting to little ones!  I bought this for my one year old grand daughter who is physically and mentally delayed due to an injury.  She wouldn't attempt to crawl until she saw the tunnel we bought for our cats.  It didn't take but a few seconds to try to crawl for the first time!  So we bought this for her and she loves it. She learned how to crawl because of it."
1,0,I bought this tunnel with the four person tent for my 19 month old daughter.  She loves it... My husband and I can actually play inside with her.  She can fall into it and it will move with her so she wont get hurt.  It is light weight and folds up easy.  This was a great investment and we all have so much fun with it!
0,1,"My son loved this pony, I got it for his first b-day. It's very sturdy and resistent."
0,1,"I bought this ride for my granddaughter's first birthday.  It has a seat so she would not fall off.  She loved playing on it.  It has a great bounce and rocking motion.  Very durable, good quality, very realistic looking with sound of horse hoofs and whinny and western song.  She is now 19 months old. Her parents took off the part that kept her from falling off as she is now old enough to get on and off by herself.  She loves her horse.  She is getting a lot of fun with this ride with years yet to come to enjoy it."
1,0,"I got this for my son when he was about 5 months old, he loved it from the first day. It taught him to roll over and to crawl. Even when he couldn't chase it, he loved watching our dog chase it. My shepherd seemed to think the monkey was out to get the baby at first and would try to chase it away from him. My son was highly amused by this. I have recommended this toy to all my friends with young babies, and they love it as well. I do agree that the monkey tips over easily, but it doesn't seem to have as many problems on a hardwood floor. On the carpeted areas, I noticed it didn't go as smoothly. Also, when you're done with it, make sure it's turned off. The slightest movement will set it off, and it will make you jump out of bed in the middle of the night wondering what the heck is going on if your cat accidentally walks too close to it."
0,1,"Although this toy states for 4-8 year olds, I think it would  work best for the higher end of this spectrum.  Getting this Mountain together took some work and although I like that idea of being able to rearrange and reconfigure it however you want, this choice leaves the entire piece unstable.  TIP: place this on a table for play since we've found leaving it on the floor leads to it falling apart more easily when played with by the kids.  I have a 4 yo son and he ends up frustrated by the way it easily falls apart but when we try to put it away, he gets upset because he really likes playing with it.......so parents beware.  Also, some of the pieces are very poorly designed (the falling palm tree rarely works and the boulder thrower does not work without breaking off) and the decoration pieces (fences & bushes)constantly fall off.  This toy is equally frustrating for both parents and children.  But my son seems to love it no matter how frustrating it gets and the related dinosaur pieces are great."
0,1,"Geotrax is the toy my 2 year old boy likes best (he received it for his second birthday) - MUCH more fun then brio and much more age-appropriate then electric trains - also very durable and easy to put together. I've bought him many of the Geotrax accessories and like all of them (the roundhouse is the one I'd least recomend for children under 2 1/2, though it works great - the bell tower is the one I'd most recommend).Because you can buy different trains with separate remote controls, friends can join in the play (and believe me, they will). That is a bit of a problem at this age, as they have not learned how to share, but it seems to me that this toy is helping to teach sharing more then most (though it inspires bigger jealousies and fights as well).It is getting better and better for him - at 27 months he is able to start assembling track (though too young to do layouts - his tracks go to nowhere and I have to help him).One major complaint is that the engines only support one speed - he is actually ready (I think) for trains that run faster.Another major complaint is that we go through a lot of AAA batteries, since he uses it for hours every day. I really wish Fisher Price made engines that contained quality batteries and plugged into a charger!!!!!You can also buy car track, but no electric cars ... hmmmmmmOther then that, I'd highly recommend this toy for any curious child who likes trains, starting at age 2 (though a bit older is better)."
0,1,"We/Santa got this for our just-turned 3 year old.  It is adorable!!  Very durable and well made; we have already added pieces to the set.  One of the added pieces is the Workin' Lifting Barrel Loader which is part of the GeoMotion system...it's like magic, and his eyes light up each time the train stops and the barrels load onto the train.  As I tried to reconfigure the track system, I turned around to see that he was setting up his own track layout!!  It is so easy for them to use and change whenever they want to...add tracks, take them away; it's so kid friendly.  I did call Fisher Price because one engine never shut off; they sent another which we received in just a couple of days!"
0,1,"This toy is absolutely awesome! My two boys want to play with this toy all of the time! They crawl over to it, sit at it for hours and continually put the balls in the hoop. They love the sounds and the lights that go off everytime they ""score."" The noise is not my favorite, but it isn't about me, it's about my boys and THEY love it! They get excited everytime! The rattle (football) is sooo much fun for them as well! They turn it again and again to watch the beads in the rattle. The baseball makes a fun clicking noise, and they laugh every time they turn it. It is super easy for them to turn (I don't understand why reviews said that it was really difficult). They don't use the bat yet, but who cares!! They pull into standing on the toy, and although it began to tip (it isn't designed for an infant to pull up on it) and it didn't break even with them yanking on it. It is made of a tough plastic, and seems like it can hold up under a lot of abuse. After reading the other reviews, I was expecting a MUCH smaller toy. This toy is a fairly large toy, just a little smaller than our toddler activity tables. I have NO clue why others are saying they are dissapointed with this toy. I have TWO 1 year olds and they BOTH love it. They haven't gotten stuck in this toy like other reviewers have warned, but I will definitely watch for that type of problem. Overall, I am very pleased with this toy, and so are my boys!"
0,1,"My son received this toy for his first birthday.  My three year old niece had managed to get her arm stuck in the basketball hoop before my sister wrapped it for my son.  I thought that was just a fluke as my niece is very active and likes to explore.  My son likes the toy's music and flashing numbers on the scoreboard but isn't crazy about the football or baseball.  They snap onto the toy at the bottom and don't stay on very well anyway.  My son has had this toy for a month now and a few days ago he managed to get his arm stuck in the basketball hoop as well.  There is a small plastic wedge that depresses when the ball goes through the hoop that activates the music and lights.  My son put his hand down the hoop after the ball and the lever depressed, but once his hand cleared the hoop, it released, leaving him unable to pull his hand back up.  I was sitting next to him and was able to reach in and depress the lever enough to slide his arm out but it still scared him enough to make him cry, and he's a tough little guy.  I think this toy could be dangerous and my son is not playing with it until my husband takes it apart and removes that lever.  I don't know how much my son will enjoy then because there will be no sound or lights...there are better toys in this price range that are not hazardous."
0,1,"I was looking at the AG girl doll beds online and the prices are ridiculous.  I bought this and am really pleased with the purchase.  The bed itself is well made and easy to put together - nice and solid.  The bedding is fine, but I am thinking of having my daughter pick out some nice fabric and making something else.  It fits her AG doll perfectly and matches my daughter's white painted furniture."
1,0,Easy to assemble and sturdy. Works well for 16 inch dolls.  Would definitely recommend  this bed. Good quality and  price was right
0,1,"I gave this Zoob set to my 6 and 4 year olds for Christmas.  They both enjoy the toy and can use it effectively.  The 6 year old immediately started using the pieces to make ""people"" in a very imaginative way.  The 4 year old just loved clicking the pieces together in long lines.  Even our 1-1/2 year old enjoys the colorful pieces and I do not see any swallow danger."
0,1,"After doing years of daycare I knew I needed a set of these for my 18 month old twins.  These are the ultimate toy in many ways.  First, they are endlessly interesting to children of many ages and ignite the imagination while excercising their gross motor skills and concentration.  2nd, they don't take batteries which is always a plus.  They are light weight and durable and able to withstand being stood on and thrown etc.  Finally when they finally give out (which should take several years) you can toss them into the recycle bin since they are made with 100% cardboard.  Does it get any better than this?  My kids knew just what to do with them even though they have never played with these before.  Just note that if you give these as a gift it might be nice to give a large/X-large plastic storage tub along with them since these take up quite a bit of space and proper storage will make mom's life easier.  Asembley is required and take about 1/2 hour or more but isn't difficult."
0,1,I love trivia games - but getting to bet on them or against your friends is too much fun! I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes trivia games!
0,1,"This game is great for small parties or large group settings.  Most of the trivia questions have most people giving their best educated guess rather than getting the right answer right off the bat.  This is great because it does not require that a player be a fantastic trivia player - only that they be able to make a decent guess. It really is anyone's game and you don't have a situation where the same smarty-pants person wins over and over again.The game moves very quickly so it's easy to keep fresh.  We spend hours playing over and over.  There have been a few times that players have gone crazy with their bets and we had to add our own poker chips to the set which worked fine, but keep that in mind.The game is very easy to learn - you can explain as you play the first round and most people pick it up instantly.  The most complicated part is being the banker and understanding odds, but if one of the players has any experience with that, it's never a problem.Very highly recommended.  Simple, fun."
0,1,"Over the past 2 years I have had the enjoyment of playing this game with friends and family.  The first time we played it the game was a little slow-going, but after that the game really picks up.  I have played this game over 40 times and I still have a blast playing it.  I will say that after playing so many times I have found that I will need to buy the expansion pack as we normally come across a few cards that we have already used and other players remember a ballpark answer.  I will also need to buy a new set of dry-erase pens as the ones that are provided with the game dry out after a few months of use.When playing with new people it is best to have one or two people in teh game that already know how to play.  Don't try explaining all of the rules up front... instead I have found it's easiest to explain the main rules before playing and then explaining the betting and payout during the first round.  This game is overall a great game to play, especially for parties that have new people that might not be aquainted with the entire group."
0,1,"Best game ever!!!  I have a whole closet of games and some how had missed out on this one.  Ever since I bought it, this is the game we always come back to.  Out of the 100 or so board/party/family games I have this is my absolute favorite.  It combines luck and skill perfectly so that everyone can enjoy regardless of how good they are at trivia.  I wish I could give this product 10 stars!!!"
0,1,"Wits and Wagers is always a hit wherever I bring it to. Game groups, friends' houses and game conventions. I've had to turn people away because I usually get the maximum seven players for it. A few times I've run out of chips because players bet big and won. But it's always a fun time. The creators of this game go to game conventions and run this game, giving away prizes. They were at the World Boardgaming Championships in Lancaster, PA. This game and their other release, Say Anything, are two of the best party games released in the last few years. They said a game show pilot of W&W; is being made for CBS. I'll keep my fingers crossed and hope for the best for them.A couple of other things. The markers with the game can dry up and not work. My advice is to do what I did and go to a stationery store and get a set of more durable markers. I even shelled out the extra money to get markers that match the colors of the pads. I used pink for yellow, since yellow is hard to read."
0,1,"My husband really wanted this game so I bought it for him.  It's like a fact guessing game.  It's pretty fun, but you can't really play w/ as many people as it says you can unless you group up.  You do learn some really interesting facts."
0,1,My dad bought two of these tiggers for my two little ones for their birthdays and they tiggers kept falling over no matter what surface of floor they were on.  We ended up taking one of them back and we thought it was a manufactuer defect but it was the toy in general. The second tigger we bought did the same thing. Every now and then it would work but less often that it should. Very upsetting to the children. This toy is truly a waste of money. We love tigger but I would not purchase this one if you truly want to be satisfied!
0,1,"After seeing the original version of the game played on Wil Wheaton's Youtube series TableTop, we purchased that version for my BIL's Xmas gift. It was a great success. We've played almost every time we go and visit or the come to visit. My wife liked it so much she said she wanted one for our family. I purchased the TtR: Europe so that we would have more variety for the family and extended family to play, rather than the exact same game. Even though it has additional mechanics that were not part of the original version (ferries, tunnels, stations), they didn't require any major strategy shifts in play. Ferries are required for sections that go over water. They also require 1 or 2 locomotives for the route. Tunnels show on the board as a set length, but there is a chance that you will need to spend up to 3 additional car cards in order to take the route. Stations allow you to use someone elses claimed section for your route. The use of stations cost car cards to place, but if you dont use them, they are worth 4 bonus points each at the end of the game. Stations can help you if someone intentionally or unintentionally blocked your route. Another plus is the cards are normal playing size rather than the much smaller cards that came with the origional version. This makes shuffling, holding and drawing the cards much easier. Her bday was in late June and we've played numerous times. Sometimes just the two of us, sometimes including our 5 & 6 yr olds as their own players. Even for them, we help very little. They dont know old Europe (neither did we really), so helping them find the destinations on the board helps. Of course, we are much less cut throat and try not to cut each other off. We also play open handed so it is easier to play nice.They come up with their own strategies and routes. A bit of coaching is necessary every now and then and keeping their attention.Over all this game is very fun to play for the whole family with a lot of replayability."
0,1,"If you are into strategy games, be sure to try this one.  I really enjoy it.I haven't played the standard USA map Ticket to Ride, so I can't compare to that one.  But this is a nice game.  It is a good combination of strategy and competition between players.  What I like, is there isn't the element of random chance introduced by dice (as in Settlers of Catan).  It is also a fairly quick game.  I also found it very easy to learn.I highly recommend it.  Playing this game has been a refreshing change from the likes of Settlers of Catan."
0,1,I bought this for my granddaughters who are 10 and 12. The whole family can play this game (up to 5) and it is lots of fun. It takes a while to learn all the rules and it is lots of fun and educational.
1,0,"Ticket to Ride Europe adds the great European cities of the 1800 to the game and throws in several addition to make a good game even better.STATIONS:  The use of the stations ends the frustration of blocked routes but at a price of 4 points, Personally I think a 6 point fine would be better but that's something individual players can decide for themselvesTunnels:  The need to match cards when digging tunnels is a great twist and simulates the risk involved for the investor.Locomotive lays:  Various lays needed wildcards adds to the flavor.This is a game that appeals to me as a big game player and appeals to my non-gaming family for it's fun.  Like the old Pirates and Traveler and Game of the states it is a nice sneak geography class.Buy it for Christmas (or even better don't wait that long)."
1,0,"Ticket to Ride - Europe is a stand alone game (doesn't require the original like some of the other expansions) and adds a new route types to the mix.If you have experience with TTR already, you can learn the extra rules to TTR-E in a minute. It's that simple.The concept is for 2-5 players to work on building train routes across Europe, this time including Ferry and Tunnel routes not in the original.The beauty of TTR, any of the full games, is that they take minutes to learn. You can buy the game, open it and in 5 minutes you should be able to be up and running. It's beautiful, and in computer terms this would be the equivalent of &#34;plug and play.&#34;I've played TTR with many people and every one has enjoyed it.Highly Recommended! Especially for families."
0,1,"We own the ticket to ride US version and one day my husband said he would like to play the Europe version.  So, I bought it for him for Christmas.I like it just as much as the original, it does have a few differences that make it just as fun to play.  The are tunnels in this game, and we were not as familiar with the routes, so the first few games were fun for us because we did not know all of the routes yet.I anticipate a lot of replay value for this game and we will have fun playing it for years to come!"
0,1,"I was disappointed in this one. I love Little People, but I'm glad I didn't purchase this--it was a first birthday gift to my son. It has some cute sounds, but thinking back to when I was a little girl (which wasn't long ago, I'm only nineteen), I know that I would have wanted to just turn the sounds off and imagine them on my own as they can get very repetitive. But, I suppose it is okay for a younger child such as my son to play with since he doesn't really know what he is supposed to imagine yet, anyway. My husband likes to play with this toy with him. It's not too terribly bulky. My son has a playroom that is filled with Little People toys, but I keep this one in the closet on a shelf. When we transitioned from an apartment to owning our first home, the first thing I did was fill his playroom with toys--Little People toys. They are great toys to allow your child to utilize what they see day to day during play.What you get:Race trackRace carRacing EddieSpecial Features:Eddie can be placed into the car and then pressed upon to trigger the car to make sounds and ""race"" around the track. The crowd also cheers.I'm not sure if there are any more parts to this since I keep it in the closet.I think it's a great toy if your child is really into cars."
0,1,"I bought two packs of these balls for 9.99 each at ""wally world"" (you know where I mean) and they are great!  We used them to fill an inexpensive inflatable pool as a ball pit. (much cheaper than the actual ball pits and just as much fun!) Yes, as another reviewer mentioned, they are smaller than the Intex balls, but since my daughter is just a year old they are perfect for her."

0,1,"I purchased this doll for my 3-year-old daughter for Christmas, and I have to say, I'm really impressed.  It's amazing to hear it say your child's name!  You can also program it with three other names that Dora will incorporate into the things she says, which I love.  She really does ""know"" every name you can think of!  My son's name is Benson, and I thought we'd probably have to settle for Dora saying ""Benny,"" but no!  Even Benson was on her list!  My husband is a product design engineer, and even he was super impressed by the features of this doll.  They really did think of everything--you can even program it while it's still in the box!  Yes, I think it's kind of a pain that Dora can't remember more and that I'll have to reprogram her twice a week or so, but to see your daughter's face on Christmas morning when she hears Dora say her name will be priceless!NOTE FOR PARENTS PROGRAMMING THE DOLL ON CHRISTMAS EVE WHEN FISHER-PRICE IS CLOSED: When I installed the drivers for this doll on my computer that runs Windows XP, I received an error message from Microsoft saying the software hadn't been tested by Microsoft for compatibility with Windows XP and that I shouldn't install it or it might make my computer unstable, susceptible to a virus, etc.  I called Fisher-Price's customer service, and they told me the software was tested by their engineers and that it's completely safe.  They told me to click ""continue"" to install the software.  I just thought I'd pass the tip along!Again, this doll is SO unqiue!  It's definitely the hot, must-have toy for Christmas!UPDATE FOR PARENTS HAVING TROUBLE INSTALLING THE DOLL'S SOFTWARE:  I have read other reviewers saying this doll keeps giving the error message that it's not connected to the computer when it is.  The doll is not defective--it goes back to the comments I made above about installing the drivers.  To fix this problem, you just uninstall the drivers using the ""control panel"" on the start menu, and then you reinstall the drivers and make sure Windows XP knows it's okay to install the software even though Microsoft hasn't tested it.  I, too, got the error message that the doll wasn't connected when it was because when I installed the drivers the first time, I stopped the installation process when I received the Microsoft error message.  To fix the problem, just uninstall the drivers and install them again, making sure to accept the installation despite the error message.  I hope that helps!"
1,0,"I bought this for my daughters 3rd birthday, and it was her favorite toy! This doll is amazing! It tells your children when it is time to wake up, eat lunch, nap, eat dinner and go to bed! It uses their name and sings songs, tells them stories, and plays games! It also knows the names of 3 of her closest friends!My 3 year old has not put it down sincer her bday 2 weeks ago. She replies to everything Dora says and giggles everytime Dora says her name, or likes the same thing she does!We gave her Dora on her bday but her party was 2 days later. On the morning of her party, my daughter was walking through our bedroom, her dad was still asleep, and Dora began singing Happy Birthday and saying she was 3. My daughter put her fingers to her lips and said very seriously, ""Shhh... Dora! Daddy is sleeping!"" When Dora continued to sing my daughter said, ""Shh... we have to go in the other room!"" She put her hand over Dora's mouth.She carries this doll everywhere with her. It eats dinner with us, goes shopping, sleeps with her. I am amazed at how much my daughter loves this doll. I was iffy when I first bought it, but it was totally worth the price!"
0,1,"My daughter received this Elmo from her grandparents last Christmas.  (She was 2 1/2.)  When I knew they were buying it for her, I was really excited, expecting it to be a HUGE hit!  Unfortunately, Elmo has gotten little to *NO* use.  He was easily programmable -- both my dad and his computer and myself and my computer had no trouble with this aspect at all.  I feel sorry for those who had so much trouble with that IN ADDITION to it not being very exciting for kids!She just genuinely was NEVER interested.  The only part she really liked or paid any attention to whatsoever was a couple of the songs.  However, unlike other toys where you can push the button until it gets to the part you want (Fisher Price's Learning Puppy), once Elmo starts to say and/or sing something, you have to listen to the WHOLE thing before he goes on to the next one.  Needless to say, that caused her frustration, and thus she lost interest even more quickly!She never paid attention to him announcing the different times of day . . . and that was annoying when it fell at the wrong time!He has literally sat in a bin in her playroom practically untouched.  Anytime she did play with him, it was at my prompting and prodding -- just HOPING he'd be the toy I'd thought he would be!  When I gave up, so did she.Since he was a gift, I gave him three stars . . . I mean, it's an *OKAY* toy.  However, if *I* had spent the money, I would have only given him 2 (or 1 even) . . . he's not worth the amount of money I know he cost."
0,1,Thi ok- very cheap looking. But my grandson likes it & that is what is important. He is 9yrs. old
0,1,"It does work but is very, very stiff.  It does not cut corners at all.  I've only had it for a few days and one of the stickers are starting to peel off.  I will be looking for another cube sometime this month.  You are definitely paying for the Rubiks brand only.  The mechanics in this cube are old and do not work well.  It took hours of work to get it to turn without a ton of problems.  Look around before you decide to buy this cube. I'm giving it three stars because Rubiks has some of the best written instructions for the 3 x3.  These are available on their website (not included)."

0,1,"I rarely write negative reviews (i just try to be helpful if an item has a negative aspect), but Santa brought this last yr for my 2 yr old daughter and it took my husband and I 2 to 3 frustrating hrs to put it together. Once it was together, the doors to the oven, refrigerator and dishwasher don't close very well (though they line up perfectly)and are VERY flimsy. I thought this would be great since the fridge door was magnetic and my daughter loves to play w/magnets on our big fridge but she had no interest in it. The phone on the side constantly falls off (and the buttons don't even mash down, much less make noise).The faucet on this sink is so big and hardly moves. There is no room in the fridge or other compartments(this and flimsy doors are biggest disadvantages)!!! It is so shallow and the room that is there isn't level enough (everything falls over). The window area with the 3 removable flowers and the grill side have been hits with my 2yr old daughter as well as my 5 yr old son. The grill is great and when the kids want to ""cook"" something, that's the side they use. Otherwise this just takes up space. I wish I had bought one of the basic wooden sets or got one by step 2 which usually uses really durable, solid plastic. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that my daughter loves the coffee pot that came with it (when you turn it up...it looks as if the pot is emptying) and she loves serving me and grandpapa our coffee.I wouldn't recommend this kitchen, even though the grill, magnetic fridge door, coffee pot and dual play are good ideas....product quality falls short!!!"
0,1,"This is awesome. The 3D gravedigger is way cooler that it looks online. It works great for storing my son's monster trucks, but we definitely should have counted them before I ordered it. I'm ordering two more ASAP. It's also great for bringing trucks to Grandma's for a sleepover!"
0,1,"Not sure why I was expecting it to, but this didn't arrive in any type of packaging. It arrived in an Amazon box, and that was it. There was no sticker on it or anything. It was scratched and looked like it had been tossed around (and maybe used?) and had dirt all over it. If I wasn't giving it as a gift, I wouldn't mind so much, because you really can't beat it for the price, but I feel like it should at least come in some sort of packaging to make it look &#34;new&#34;.I like that it is lightweight and can hold a lot of Matchbox cars. It seems very sturdy and well-made."
1,0,"This is a nice product.SET UP:This product is easy to set up, and should take maybe 10 minutes.  It DOES NOT come with any instructions.  It should, especially for someone who has never set up a tent before. If you haven't ever done so, it would be best to refer to the photo on the box.  Basically, set up consists of laying the tent flat on the floor, assembling the two shock cord poles (screw each of them together by tightening the pole pieces into the attached couplers, and then thread each of the two poles through one set of loops.  The loops run from each of the four bottom corners of the tent, up to the roof, and back down to the opposite corner.  There are ties at the roof top to fasten the top of the tent to the poles as well.We bought the tent for our 8 year old and she loves it.DESIGN:The tent is colorful.  It is the size that is advertise, slightly under 5' by 5', and around 4' high in the center.  One of the four walls has no openings.  Make this your back wall if you want to place the tent against a wall. One wall has a full zippered opening (best access point for large adults).  The other two walls each have a round opening and a ""door"" which can be draped and fastened over the opening, or rolled up and fastened for entrance. An adult who is not real big can use these holes too (small frame).  Inside the tent is roomy.  I am a average height for a man and about 210 lbs, and I sat in the tent with my 8 year old and there's still room for a couple more kids, teenagers, etc.  Usually, its my 8 year old, her 13 and 21 year old sisters and 16 year old brother.  So it will easily hold a few kids. The tent has a plastic floor, which seems durable.  it is not too flimsy, but it is also not an extremely heavy gauge.  Again, it's a play tent.  The roof is mostly mesh, which allows for some privacy for the kids playing in the tent, but still lets parents supervise them.  It also provides air flow and lets hot air rise up and out.USE:This tent is very roomy, just allow space in your home for it.  5x5 is a fair amount of space. But it's nice because it allows for adults or older siblings to fit in the tent and play with their kids/younger siblings. It is advertised as an indoor/outdoor  tent .  You absolutely can use it indoors.  As for outdoors, I would note two things: Typically you tether an outdoor tent, even a small one, with cords and stakes.  There are loops, etc. on this tent to do that, but you would need to supply your own cords and stakes.  The other thing is, as mentioned above, the upper portion of the roof is a ""mesh"" weave.  If it was raining to any degree, the water would enter.Overall, this tent is a great price, the set up is quick, and it seems sturdy enough.  I think it is high enough quality to hold up to some rough housing, but of course if kids jump on it, then can break parts or knock it over.  It is a nice size.  My kids love it.  They sit in it at night and play cards and ""camp out"" with a lantern and some snacks.I really don't think you can go wrong with this tent, especially since it costs no more than a couple of DVD movies.I would have given it 5 stars, but gave it 4, as selling any product that requires assembly without instructions is nonsense.  While it is easy, especially if you've assembled tents, the maker should include directions for the novice."
0,1,Kids like it better than adults. When I set it up they immediately wanted to climb in before I finished. This is definitely an outdoor toy along with the tunnel which we also bought to go with it. So think out of doors unless you have a very big space available indoors. If you put it up outdoors STAKE IT (stakes not included). It can blow away in the wind.
0,1,"This was bought for my 2-1/2 year old during the winter holidays. He is very active - into sports and cars - and I wanted something for him to be able to sit STILL and do by himself when I needed a break.  I tried blocks and other building sets and he just wasn't into contructing, so I decided to try the Storybook Reader (though I was a bit hesitant because we treasure story time at night, and I thought he'd prefer the Reader).  Believe me, it doesn't replace you, but it is certainly a life-saver when you need one!I have one big CON:-The pages of the books should be laminated. Kids can be so rough with their toys. Notebook-style binding is fine but the pages need to be more durable. They are all bent up now and the Reader can't detect which page we're on.PROS:-Cartridges and books are easy to match. An older toddler or preschooler can do it himself/herself.-There is a place for headphones. My son likes the freedom of adjusting the volume control, which means it's usually loud!-There is a sound at the end of each page so that a younger child using the Reader will know when to turn the page.I love this idea and the technology behind it, but really the books should be better quality. They should not be able to be ripped out or bent up like notebook paper.  The Reader itself is great. Durable. I tried to self-laminate the of the rest of the books and I was quite peeved at having to modify a product just for it to function properly.  Aside from that, my son loves his Reader and we use it several times per day."
0,1,Havent heard how this game is for the kiddos but it sure looks like fun.
0,1,"We received this game as a gift, and my 4-year-old daughter was excited to play it (she has the Grumpy Ladybug game, and this is pretty much in that vein).  This game is sheer torture for the parents that have to play it.  There is no educational value in this game (unless your child is learning to recognize numbers 1-6).  The game can get tedious as mentioned in other reviews, so the ""saving grace"" in most childrens' game, i.e. that they play fast, this one doesn't even have.  There are tons of other games in this age-range that are far, far superior."
1,0,"Loved the concept, and the kids loved them at first, but the material is very cheap.  Not soft at all... even a little scratchy.  So they've ended up in the bottom of the toy bin.  Pretty cute, just wish they were better material."
0,1,"This is an X-Mas gift. So, it is still un-opened but seems to be a new quality leapster game. No complaints."
0,1,"I just bought this game for my 4 year old son and he really likes this game over all the other games he has for his leapster...I would recommend this for anyone who has the leapster game system, very educational and fun and it's easy for him to understand as well."
0,1,"My son really likes this game, and I love that he is learning to write his letters.. He does have a hard time writting them tho, you need to be quite exact.. They should give a little more room for error.."
0,1,After looking through my sons box of track pieces for that one piece that will complete his track for the day......only to realize that that double male sided piece has all ready been used I decided to buy this adapt-a-track. Best/most useful track piece you will every buy.
0,1,"thought I wouldn't like it as much because the roller doesn't actually roll, but that really doesn't matter, it is still easy to use!"
0,1,These tools provide non-stop fun for my boys when they get out their Play-Doh. They are sturdy and work well. My only complaint is that I should have bought 2 sets!
0,1,"This was in addition to the 24 pack of Play-Doh that we ordered...gotta have the tools to cut & play with the Play-Doh, right?!  :)  They are a great addition!"
0,1,These tools make play doe that much more fun. I let me son play with these and some cookie cutters and he stays entertaine for hours.
0,1,Makes play dough more fun--lots of ways to use them and have fun with creativity  good buy  durable and easy for toddlers
0,1,We bougth this to accompany a play doh set.  The tools are large and easy to use.  Just as expected.  Functionable.
0,1,"I bought some of these toys individually at a big brand name children's learning store.  They are way over priced there.  I ordered more on amazon.com and I cant get over the price difference.  At the big box learning store one item retails for four dollars- here u can get the whole set for a lot less money.  The set works great for play-doh, crayola model magic,  and some other air dry only clay.  The utensils are easy to clean and are lasting well with rough and tough children playing hard with the utensils."
0,1,"Cute set for and a great addition to playing with play-doh.  The roller does not spin but my daughter doesnt seem to mind.  with this, you can be more creative in the things you make!  Would highly recommend this product!"
0,1,They work nicely with the play doh 24 pak I purchased. No issues with quality and item arrived 1 day ahead of schedule so that's a bonus!!  So far they work well and for the price you cannot go wrong.
1,0,"These are great! Good for small hands, good quality, really fun to use with play dough, also with real dough to help me bake! My toddlers love these and they made great gifts."
1,0,These are great tools for play doh.  I was looking for something sturdy that my son wouldn't break.  They have held up very well so far and he enjoys using them.
1,0,"I purchased to use with the magic clay by but I think my great nephews, 3 and 4 years were to young for the tools, they liked using their hands."
1,0,Our granchildren have all enjoyed these tools for working with the play dough (no brand names allowed :)  We have probably purchased a dozen of these as gifts for little ones.
0,1,"We bought this dough set for our 2 year old daughter. I think they are great and very sturdy. These tools are wonderful. They are thick, high quality plastic with smooth edges and a glossy finish. I can see them lasting through our toddlers dough playing years."
0,1,"I had wondered why I found this so cheap...only 19.99 last Christmas. I can only imagine it was so inexpensive, because it is impoosible to put together!! We tried to assemble it a few times, but it never worked out (I'm convinced we are missing a few pieces!) The instuctions are basically just pictures and nothing is coded, so it's hard to figure out. This year, I'm getting my son the Imaginext Batman Batcave, which was a hugh hit with my nephew last year...and comes fully assembled! Unless you have tons of time on your hands and lots of patience, I don't suggest buying the t-rex."
0,1,"I can't believe the number of low ratings this toy gets.  It seems as if most people are just lacking in patience.  yes, it's good sized and does take some time to put togehter.  And also, if you try to move it across the floor it can some apart...it takes all of about 5 seconds to put it back together again!  Here's a tip if you plan on moving it frequently...lay the toy down on something....a think piece of cardboard or perhaps a pillow case or something and just pull it.This is a building toy that is meant to be taken apart.  While the instructions show you one way only to build the set, kids are only limited by their own imaginations.  You can build different configurations.  The T-Rex mountain features a number of cool features.  The top part is the T-Rex Skull.  The upper jaw tilts up and you can put the little cavemen or whatever inside on his tongue.  Push the right button to light up his eyes and hear a munching sound.  Push the left and the tongue dumps the contents into the skeleton T-Rex belly with more munching sounds followed by a huge belch.Put a ball or whatever into the compartment behind his head and watch it come out the bottom down a steep slide.  Put a guy at the base of the set udner the T-rex hand and press the button...the hand slams down on the unsuspecting victim.  This toy is great fun and not nearly the aggravation that some people are claiming."
0,1,These cars are great!!  Just shake them up and they go. Our two and a half year old loves them (we have two). Totally kid friendly for hours of fun. I don't have one thing that I would change about them and the price is great too!!
0,1,Great family game.  My daughter reaches for this game often for family game nites.  Challenging yet fun.  A must have.
1,0,Not 100% symmetrical in the face (nose/mouth is sewn unevenly) but otherwise very nice quality and super soft. Little one loves monkeys and this is one of her favorites second only to the Lambs and Ivy Lollipop Jungle monkey.
0,1,"Not bad, great idea so there are no tangles.  Can remember when I was a kid spending half the time undoing the strings all tangled up.  As one reviewer mentioned it does require a strong arm.  I taped a small weight to mine for my 5 year old and that helped.  I will say the younger kids will loose interest fairly quickly since they can't throw it that high but for $5 it is the best thing I've seen for a while."
0,1,"Son loves this. Doesn't tangle or break like cheaper, plastic, multipack parachute guys. He can't wait to get another so they can race to the bottom of the steps. Not often dropped in the dark, so the glow aspect is an extra that he doesn't care as much about. If priced the same, would buy the glow one again just to have the option, but isn't necessary."
0,1,My 4 year old loves this toy! Its a great deal at around 5 bucks. Every night at sunset he asks me to go out front and throw it with him. What a great idea to solve the problem of the little plastic parachute men that always tangle within a couple throws. The stitching could be a little better but I weigh that against the super low price for fun. When it tears or falls apart I'll just buy another. It also glows like crazy with a little exposure to light.Why didn't I think to invent this first?!?!
0,1,"As always, every Nerf toy we have bought has been awesome.  This is for kids and adults alike.  Trust me, my husband has spent hours playing with all our nerf toys.  Yes, I have too.  We love Nerf and now we have this great addition to the family.  You cannot go wrong when it says Nerf.  I do suggest investing in the safety glasses if you don't already have them.  Oh, and don't do as my son does.........shoot at someone too close.  Hurt, no, but totally unfair!"
1,0,"My son got this gun but he's too young so I took it on my annual elk hunting trip last week and let me tell you I am a durn good shot and my aim was perfect but despite shooting 52 times and hitting the elk square in the head every single durn time that elk acted like I was shooting marshmellers at him. Really disappointin' plus my two buddies laughed so hard they had ""accidents"" in their camos and they are still pokin' fun at me for what they call is my terribul accuracy but it's this gun not me. I gave it back to my son and at least he's havin' some fun knocking all Ma's knickknacks off the shelves and tables, course it don't hurt that I pay him a dollar for every one he breaks. I hate that stuff, especially now that it's Christmas and she scatters hundreds of stupid elfs and angels on every surface including in my bathroom of course that's no problem as I just flush a few everytime I'm in there, which is a lot due to eating her delicious Pinto bean wreath cookies all day long.From the Queen's Kitchen; a Collection of Recipes From the Pinto Bean Cooking Contest Held Each Year During the Four Corners Harvest Festival in Cortez, Colorado5"" White Peppermint Twist Elf By Annalee"
0,1,My kids got Leapster L-max's for Christmas this year and this is my daughter's favorite game.  She will play it for hours if I let her and she is learning!  I am excited to see what other games are available for her.  My 3 year old son absolutely loves the Letter Factory game.  He is really learning his alphabet.  It is so neat to see them having fun playing and learning at the same time.
1,0,This one is not!  I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this.  I remember them being alot easier to spin in the 80s.  My daughter figured out the turning motion quickly but it's very hard for her to turn.  She's already figured out she can go faster standing up (and that's not a good thing).  The music is very loud as well.  Fortunatly there is an off button for that.  This sit and spin is not really worth it.
0,1,My kids never seemed interested in actually sitting and spinning on this thing.  All they wanted to do is activate it and listen to the music - over and over again.  I couldn't wait to throw this thing away.
0,1,"Purchased this easil for my twins after looking at many different makers.  I needed a double sided easil with clips and trays on both sides so that both my toddlers could use it at the same time.  I loved the ample trays on each side and have had no problem of them falling off.  I love the paper clip on each side and that it comes with magnetic letters and an eraser, you just have to provide the paint, chalk and dry erase markers.  I love that it's light weight so that I have no problem closing it up and storing it away, it even has hand grips on each side for easy carrying.  I've even put a blanket over it and my twins have used it as a fort or pretended it's a school bus.  Great little easil for the price (other brands sell for much more and cheaper ones fall apart) and I would highly recommend it."
0,1,"For any item you look at replay (reusable) value.  This does not have much of a reusable value and for this reason I give it an okay rating.Sits on your desk and kids love to turn it over and it can calm them down or get their minds off things, but it doesn't last long.  Once the kid has seen it and played with it twice or three times, they are completely done with it.  I spent about 5 dollars on it so I can't say it is a total waste, but unless you like little trinkets on your shelf this item is not worth it.For those who like trinkets, the base is not flat and tilts.  It has notches so it doesn't fall completely over, but you never get a flat movement like it shows on the picture.  It can be a conversational piece though for any office, or just something to look at while people are waiting."
0,1,My daycare children loves these items and watching the differences in the motion tubes. Great prices for the pieces. like having the different colors
0,1,"Once you start watching, you won't stop.  Something fascinating about it.  Just watching the drops go down and around will help you get though tedious moments.  Great for the classroom as kids love it and will keep them occupied when done early with assignments."
1,0,Fun watching the kids try and count all the little balls that drop down the slides. This is great for any age! Very fun to watch!!
0,1,"This is very well-made and is another great product from Step2.  I really appreciate their products because they are built to last.  I purchased this for one grand daughter about two years ago, and it has held up well.  Also, I purchased their picnic table about three years ago for my grandson, and he still uses it all the time.  I sound like I work for them, but I don't.  I just appreciate quality toys when so many are cheaply made of inexpensive materials.  You won't be disappointed in this."
0,1,"My son has the Step 2 sand and water table so to keep my daughter out of his monster truck ""shows"" on said table we got my daughter this table for her 2nd birthday.  Good choice, too good of a choice in retrospect because now my son (4 1/2 years old) wants to play on his sister's sand table as much as his own.  We have several Step 2 products purchased for my older son and they are still going strong and have not faded even though they sit out day after day in the hot sun.  I have become a huge fan of the ""Naturally Playful"" line because the color palette Step 2 has chosen just looks so nice on our deck and in our backyard. This sand table is no exception. Upon ordering the table I was prepared to ""fix"" the lid with silicon caulking to plug the tiny holes that the rope handles go through like one reviewer suggested but decided against this as we prefer the sand to be damp so that it is easier for little hands to mold.  We bought official white ""play sand"" per another reviewer's suggestion and that is working extremely well and has a great texture so thanks to all of you that take the time to be so helpful in your reviews.  This table holds enough sand to similate things my daughter likes to do at the beach like fill up her large butterfly shaped molds and it provides enough surface area for all three to be made and they are not small butterflies.  We are more than happy with our choice and do not miss the umbrella that my son's table has because the lack of umbrella provides more play space and I think that adds to what makes this table so well liked by both children and provides enough room for both to play together when the older brother just can not resist a visit to his sister's table."
0,1,my boys love this.
0,1,"I bought this table for my 18 month old son. I wanted to get a sturdy water table (especially the legs) and not a sand and water combo table (muddy water). Also I wanted to just get something he can stand and not have to sit in. I know this is a sand table but it works great as a water table too. Holds about 6 gallons of water and the legs are very sturdy. Holds the water weight great and was sooo easy to set up. You just have to snap in the legs and fill with whatever you want. I would like to try other things during winter like corn, beans, rice or pasta. Great sensory play. The older kids like it too. They just grab a seat right next to it instead of standing over. I highly recommend! Also I ordered the Kaplan Sand wheel factory, Freddy the freestyle swimmer windup toy and the aquaplay water pump from Amazon. They are a great addition the the table."
0,1,"I love Mad Gab!Hen Reek Hay He Clay See As(answer at end of review!)It is so funny to hear people say these phrases and try to figure out what they are actually saying!  Sometimes it is as clear as a bell, other times not so much!  And I have noticed different people hear these phrases differently!  So much fun from pre-teens to adults!(Enrique Iglesias)"
1,0,"I've been wanting to get this game for a long time! It's such a fun game. Not really educational, but it gets your mind thinking. My kids picked this out as a present for daddy for Christmas. Can't wait to play once again, it is such a funny game. I think every family should get this game. You will have lots of fun, and lots of laughs along the way."
0,1,Much smaller than expected and doesn't really suck up anything. Not too loud which is nice. My 2 year old loves it though.
0,1,"I've played Roborally quite a few times, and although the game is fun, I wish there was more to it.Roborally is a boardgame where each player (up to 8) controls a robot that is trying to get through an obstacle course. The course is player constructed and the robot must navigate through hazards such as treadmills, spinning gears and lasers, not to mention all of the other robots racing him. To do this, players are given a set of cards with instructions on them, such as ""move 1 space forward"" or ""turn left"" or ""back up"". The player must then put the instructions into a queue that will execute over the course of the turn (every robot does their first action, then their next, and so on). Mayhem is introduced immediately when players start bumping into each other and firing their lasers at each other. With more players comes more mayhem and to a certain extent more fun.The problem with the game though is the complexity of managing the rules and instructions. The instructions themselves are straight forward, but linking them together can be frustratingly difficult when trying to figure out if you need to turn left or right, and if it would be better to postpone your movement by turning in circles for a few rounds. Likewise, in order to make everything work predictably, there are all sorts of rules on what goes first, and how stuff moves and affects the robots, which can be maddening if you're not good with that sort of thing.Ultimately it's a fun distraction, lasting as long or as short as you want. You need to be careful who you play with though: my sister has been brought to tears playing this game."
0,1,My grand daughter and I like this and we spend time doing the coloring. This is a big hit with both of us!
1,0,My 3 and 5 year old grandchildren love dragons and this one is exceptional.  Schleich toys are always very well detailed and sturdy.  We have a whole zoo of them.  This one is also scary enough to be cool.
0,1,"I purchased this little fellow in Prague after being given the Dragon for Christmas. While technically it's considered part of the fantasy collection (being the Black Knight of legend), it's still a remarkably detailed piece, with an amazing level of historical accuracy in tournament armor of the 15th century. It's made of highly durable plastic, and though the Knight can be detached from the horse and the lance is also detachable, overall it's rugged enough to withstand the rigors of entertaining youngsters. I bought several other members of the Schleich Knights series for my two nephews, aged 4 and 6, so there is minimal concern that the detachable parts could be dangerous for young children."
0,1,"This toy has got power! My 3-year-old son learned how to use the controls on day 1. I was surprised by how powerful it is. It's an excellent remote-control-car. We haven't tried it in water, and because of negative water reviews of this toy, we won't try. But at least if he accidentally drives it through a little puddle on the sidewalk, there shouldn't be any problems. That's a huge plus for a toy that can be used outdoors. My son loves to use it indoors as well."
0,1,"So I give this a 2.5, but I am comfortable in erring on the side of nah. I purchased two. My six and 2.992335-year old sons opened them and it turned out to be pretty disappointing in that each remote controls both cars. Oh my goodness. I could just see the disasters in a Kid Galaxy Morphibians Conference! Maybe I am missing that electronical engineering common sense gene that alerts all buyers of two remote controlled toy vehicles. All that could be seen was a blurry little mass of long blond curls running up the nearest barstool as my 2.992335-year old ran shaking and crying upon trying it/them out. :("
1,0,"This is the second one we've owned to entertain the grandkids. Our 6, 5 and 3 year olds particularly enjoy working at mastering the controls. We had trouble with stripping out threads in the plastic channel for the Phillips-head screw to change the battery on a red one, but as long as you're careful this shouldn't be a problem. Keep batteries on hand they will last a good while if you remember to make sure the car itself is turned &#34;OFF&#34;."
0,1,"I was so excited about this car....sounds sooo cool....if it actually drove in the water like it's supposed to!!!  Each time I placed it on top of the pool surface or in the bath tub, it immediately died and didn't drive!!  I mean how lame that a toy meant to drive through water doesn't really do it!  It does work good on dry land and looks cool.  Would not recommend if you want to actually use it on water!"
0,1,"This WAS a great toy, before it died.  We took it out of the box and one of the first things we realized was that the headlights are fake, they don't light up.  My son, who is 5, drove it around like crazy, over small rocks, in the swimming pool, in a puddle.  After a few days of rugged driving, it started acting up.  First, the on/off switch is extremely hard to turn on and off, even for an adult.  But that aside, it acted up after replacing the batteries.  After turning it on and manipulating the control it wouldn't do anything, but it would eventually start working, no explanation.  Oh, and it EATS, INHALES, WIPES OUT batteries quick!  After about 9 batteries I finally found some rechargeable batteries I had.  Overall, it is a fun toy, and for the price, maybe its worth the money knowing it will only last a few weeks."
0,1,"Good quality, durable, easy to use, but killer on batteries. It goes through batteries so fast it's not worth it to keep buying them for this car, after a couple uses and a ton of batteries, it now sits on a shelf"
1,0,"I have bought several of these now.  They are a great price and make a great present for boy birthday parties that we attend.  The boys are always excited to receive them.  Haven't heard any complaints of them not working, so I assume all is okay."
0,1,"This thing is a battery monster, gobble gobble gobble. Eemmmm batteries. I would suggest another option a rechargeable option. Slow  and noisy for so much juice."
0,1,"I should have listened to the review that said 'this toy will break, if you buy it and it stops working then I told YOU'.  This toy worked once right after we bought it.  The batteries were dead the next day.  Replaced them.  Used it once more for an hour, had a lot of fun.  Batteries ran out.  Replaced them.  Then we tried to use it a third time at the beach and it worked for about 5 minutes and then quietly passed away.  Now the wheels don't turn at all.  It is totally dead.  Such a waste of money.  Disappointing because my son loved this toy for the few minutes when it worked."
0,1,The puppet is cute & very soft.  My biggest complaint would be that the hand space is very small.  Description on some puppets will tell you they are for small hands--this one did not.
0,1,I ordered this for our 2 year old grandaughter and she loved  it! She loved to cuddle with it and watch us make it talk.
0,1,"This is a great toy for a toddler.  It's both fun and educational.  They can learn shapes, colors, sorting, patterns, etc.  Plus its just fun too."
1,0,"I loved the idea of using an inflated globe for teaching my kids the continents in a hands-on way, but sadly ours deflated after the first day.  It apparently has a hole somewhere, because it continues to deflate.  And I didn't let my children kick and throw it around (which is, of course, what they wanted to do the moment I blew it up), so this was with gentle handling.  If you don't mind trying to find and plug the holes that apparently are made easily, this globe might work for you.  Note that it doesn't inflate to look as round as it does in the stock photo (check out customer photos).  It features enough detail for a basic knowledge of world locations - though in the U.S. states are not named, only cities.  I personally purchased a mini globe and am much happier with it."
0,1,"I bought this to explain to my kiddo about night and day and for him to visualize the earth rotation, and why it's sunny here when it's dark in asia. I don't need it to last a long time, but it served a purpose for a good price."
1,0,The jumbo size farm animals look like the real animals.  My almost two year old grandchildren have fun telling me all about the animals and make the animal sounds. They like the box with the carry handle to store the animals.
0,1,What a great set of animals. We bought this for our daughter when she was 18 months old. She is now 2 and enjoys playing with the animals and making their various sounds. I can see this product lasting for a very long time in our house.
1,0,Purchased this for my 1 year old son and it's really big but he loves to play with it and measures everything.
0,1,"This tape measure is super-sized, with easy to read numbers (and no danger of slicing little hands, as we had feared might happen when our son began playing with Daddy's tape measure!). It has a carrying handle, and is fully functional, a perfect addition to our 5 year old's pretend play arsenal. :)"
0,1,"This gift was purchased as an ""extra"" something for my four year old grandson at Christmas. At first he was not so excited about it and thanked me politely. Since Christmas when I go to visit I have seen him measure his sisters height the length of tables and anything that interests him. It is not something  he plays with all the time but he does enjoy it. It is a good tool for learning."
0,1,"My 3 year old son loves this Tape Measure, he was always begging to play with Daddy's so we got this for him and it kept him busy with measuring EVERYTHING in the house.. his favorite?  Our heads!The tape measure itself is great quality,  it is sturdy, attached well to the base, and soft, but tough so it does not cut any little fingers.  I do wish there was a mechanism to put the tape up rather then rolling... My son never does the rolling. Would have been great if it had a pull. I'm sure that would help in keeping him more interested as well.  Either way this is a great Tape Measure and I would certainly buy it again for the 5 and under crowd."
0,1,"My kids really like these. They are BIG! Despite the fact they are cardboard they are still really sturdy. My kids love to build towers and then run into them or punch them! Good blocks all around! Also, fairly easy to put together. By mistake I had thrown away the instructions and I still managed to figure out how to put them together."
0,1,"Kahuna: 2 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 30 MinutesThe game turned out to be pretty fun...it was a challenge to keep what I had under my control.  The game has a mix of both strategy and luck, so sometimes no matter how well I seemed to play, luck would hold me back.  The game does help to offset the luck of the draw by giving the player three face up cards to choose from, which in my opinion is a bonus.The box and the components are fairly light, making it ideal for travel when going on vacation.  You couldn't play it in the car, but it certainly is small enough to where you wouldn't need a lot of room to play.  The cards and the text are easy to read and the pieces are sturdy, so no complaints in that department.Vinnie (11) and I played a quick game, but it was close in score all the way through.  In the first round, we had our pick of bridges to place, gaining territories with ease.  We expanded our hold on islands without running into each other much, if at all.  We ended up tying the first round and thus no one scored any points.  The second round was a different story...the board was beginning to feel cluttered and we were constantly stepping over each other, claiming territories, and removing bridges as the result of claiming said territories.  He pulled ahead by one territory, bringing the score to 0-2.  The last round was very cluttered and I had to change tactics a bit.  I concentrated on removing his bridges and I was able to remove enough to where he lost the majority on a few islands, but it wasn't enough.  My six to his five islands gave me one point...not enough to tie him or win the game.We both felt that the game was well balanced...that is...neither of us felt like the other was running away with the lead.  Next time, I intend to try mixing up my tactics and try to remove his bridges earlier than the third round.  All in all, I thought it was decent two player game...it is certainly casual enough that it would appeal to families looking for some one on one time with a spouse or sibling."
0,1,"Most magic kits targeted for kids always seem to turn out to be junk. Companies put money into the packaging, but don't bother making anything that actually works or it ends up being far too difficult for kids to actually do without an adult walking them through every step.However, Melissa and Doug have finally made a working, high quality magic set for kids! The tricks are easy enough for young kids to do over and over again, without getting frustrated or lost in the directions. I bought this for a 7 year old and within 5 minutes of opening the magic set, he was putting on a show for everyone.This set is well made and will last a long time, even with tons of little hands all over them. Pieces are made of wood and painted cleanly and nicely, instead of flimsy plastic or cardboard.Melissa and Doug have created a really nice kid magic set!"
1,0,The items in this kit are very chunky and easy for young small hands to manipulate. They are very easy to use and very easy to learn. The bright colors add to the fun.My son enjoys this magic set and has for some time now. He had no problem learning the tricks and remembering them after not using them for some time.Enjoy.
1,0,Arrived fast and as described . It was not as much fun as the 1st magic item but price was good so I bought both. It was fun for a period but I think I should have bought the 1 for same fun payoff. Still cute and sweet gift
1,0,"I love this kit for my 7 year old.  The tricks are good enough that my hubby did not know how they were done at first.  Of course my 7 year old was more than willing to give away the secrets. Melissa and Doug toys are abundant in our house and this one does not disappoint.  We even have a couple of the other magic kits, and this one is one of our favorites because of the the little &#34;stage&#34; that you can use to keep your props under when performing."
0,1,"The first purchase was from Warehouse Deals for $5 or $10 off the regular price. It was supposed to be a complete toy. It was in fact missing trailer hitch and had scratches all over the white top portion of the trailer. We returned.The second purchase was at full price from another seller. This toy that arrived was not the trailer as pictured but an older version that was not nearly as well crafted, well colored, etc. We returned.Just not getting any luck getting the actual toy we see in this photo and description."
1,0,"3 year old loves the stamp kit. Need to wipe off the stamp if you are going to mix colors (and what 3 year old is not going to mix colors). Good quality, lots of fun"
1,0,Bought this along with some other Dr Who stuff for my 9 year old grandson who just spent three days in Children's Hospital.  A reward for being a brave boy.He loves it.  Going around the house trying to open doors etc...... He had been wanting the 10th dr screwdriver for awhile.  He is a recent convert to the Dr Who universe.  I think I am rubbing off on the boy.  Love him.
0,1,"I got this for my son who is a big Dr. Who fan along with his grandma and I. It comes with two pens: one is invisible ink and one is regular ink. Both fit real easily into the screwdriver. The only thing I worry about is the cap getting lost, but so far that doesn't seem to be an issue. It comes with great sounds that aren't too loud as to be annoying, but loud enough to hear it just fine. It also expands. I think this is a great buy! My son had opened the fridge, soda, freezer, controlled the T.V. and even used it on his toy Tardis. He's already getting plenty of use out of it."
0,1,"My son ordered this, he seems to like it very much. It came in handy for me as I was able to use it for a &#34;painting w/ lights&#34; picture I took. It came out very nice."
0,1,"well made. It does annoy me a bit that the bottom doesn't stay on a bit more securely, but being able to have a pen attachment is a nice touch. The UV light also is a nice addition when it comes to playing around with glow-in-the-dark paint, shirts, etc."
0,1,"This is a great little toy food cake!  My son and any friends he has over, thoroughly enjoy it!  I'd definitely reccommend it!"
0,1,"My daughter liked it a lot at first, but now only plays with it every once and a while, but other children I babysit play with it fairly often.  It's fun and easy to stack with the velcro, although it looks a little awkward when you put everything on your burger.  It's cute looking and has held up very well for as long as we've had it - none of the velcro has come off at all!"
0,1,"great product, timely delivery"
0,1,I purchased this cookware set for my daughter at Christmas.  She is a little rough with her toys and has definitely put these to the test.  They have held up with ease.  Super cute and great value.
0,1,My grandkids love this set and anything they are happy with I am happy with. It is made well and is attractive.
0,1,"This is a great little set for the price! It comes with lots of pieces, I know the pic is a little misleading since the food is just there as a prop, not as part of the set, but that is explained in the discription so the people who were expecting the food to be there probably should have read the details before buying. The pots are a decent size for a kids kitchen, they fit great on my daughter's KidKraft Vintage Kitchen. They hold the play food just fine and my daughter enjoys playing with them.The only thing I dislike, is that in order to put the lid on the largest pot, you have to line it up correctly and turn it to lock it into place under the handles. Also, it has to be twisted to the correct side. It's a little difficult to explain but it's harder than it should be I think. My 2 year old sometimes has a hard time getting that 1 lid on. If it weren't for that one issue I would have given this toy 5 stars.It's made of thick, durable plastic and so far I'm pertty happy with the purchase."
0,1,Great little cooking set for children from about 1 and up - our kiddos are from 2 to 5 and they love it!
0,1,"It looked like such LARGE set in the photos, but it is very small. Very expensive for the size of this set. Very disappointing."
0,1,I've looked at several cut-and-serve food sets.  This is the best I've seen.  I love how the banana peels and the orange peel comes off before segmenting it.  Velcro is easy to cut and yet holds together well.  Very colorful and durable.  Toddler and preschooler love playing with this set.
0,1,Very &eacute;ducatif and fun for kids. They can learn a lot and do a lot if different activities with it.
0,1,I AM SURE I WILL BE EATING A LOT OF THIS ICE CREAM OVER THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY AS MY GRANDDAUGHTER WILL BE SERVING IT TO US FROM HER NEW PLAY KITCHEN...IT IS REALLY A CUTE SET.
0,1,"My kids (5,3,2) love these. They play with them for at least an hour or longer. They love putting them back together and starting all over. They've had them for about three months and the Velcro on them are still strong and are staying on. That was my only worry was that the Velcro wouldn't last. No signs of wear yet."
0,1,Our grandson feels as though he is helping us cook when he uses the veggies.  The fact that he can &#34;cut&#34; them makes them all the more realistic.  Very fun toy!
0,1,"This is a great purchase!  My son loves pretending to chop his veggies and serve them to Mama.  All of the veggies can be cut or peeled, or both.  However, the corn is the only piece that doesn't work out as well.  Supposedly you can peel the husks, but they don't really stay on very well.  Regardless, all of the other pieces work great and our kiddo loves them.  Also, great for coordination and practicing motor skills."
0,1,"My family and I love doing puzzles and have never tired one that does not have a picture on it. My 17 year old son wanted to tackle getting the edges together and it took him about 2 hours to do it. You definitely have to rely solely on the shapes of the pieces to put it together. We are till working on it a bit each day. It is a lot of fun, and we enjoy that it is different from any other puzzle we have put together."
1,0,"We had family in town recently and I thought that a couple of puzzles would be a fun challenge for when the kids started getting bored. I got two puzzles (In Paris 1500 pieces and Krypt Silver 654 Piece), both made by Ravensburger. Both are sadistically difficult. My nephew who loves puzzles tried to tackle this for 2 hours. When I finally came to check on him, he didn't have much to show for his efforts and had given up. I mention this because for someone who is not devoted to the maniacally complex  -  these aren't the puzzles for you.But if you are looking for a challenge, well, you are in the right place.  While it is only 654 pieces, what makes this puzzle so difficult?1. IT IS ONLY ONE COLOR... yeah, let that sink in for a minute.2. Each piece is different. While you normally differentiate pieces by what they look like, with this puzzle you diferentiate them by the geometric pattern that the total puzzle creates.3. Sometimes building this can get a bit overwhelming and may require you to take a break. For most people, I would say that this isn't going to be a 2 hour project. Antisipate more time.... a LOT more time.The puzzle does come with a guide, but that is just for the overall shape, not the individual pieces. I can honestly say that this is a very difficult puzzle, maybe not the most difficult ever, but it ranks up there.Still interested? Then this may be the puzzle for you. You will definitely get your money's worth as you built this amazing single color geometric shape."
1,0,Months Later and we gave up.  It's very challenging and we feel exhausted.  Pictures are funner and more enjoyable than being overly challenged.  I am sure there are others out there bored with the normal puzzle but I like tradition.  overall its fun and maybe we will try again to finish it but for now its under the rug and forgotten about.
0,1,"This one was too much for me and my family. All white, with strange shaped pieces, we couldn't finish it.It is well made, deviously ingenious, and very frustrating. It would be five stars to someone who likes a serious puzzle challenge. For us, we found it maddening."
1,0,"The concept behind this mat is ingenious,  but the materials let it down.This was purchased years ago for my oldest son, but I couldn't figure out how to fold it, so it was tucked in the closet.  Yes, I'm embarrassed to admit that!Anyway, my 3 year old found it and dragged it out last year. I don't know why, but I was able to figure out how to fold it in minutes that time! Wierd..... So, we'll call the folding issue my problem (although my husband still can't do it! Lol).The BIG, BIG issue is the top layer of plastic peeling off. Quickly. Thus making this product completely unsafe for a small child, and quickly unusable even if your child is old enough not to put pieces in his/her mouth.Even if this were not an issue this wouldn't work for us because we have probably a hundred cars! Every time he wanted to use this he had to dump all the cars! Which means getting him to pick them all up again! :(We do still use this for car storage, but we never unfold it. I bought my 3 year old a carpet road mat and we love it! It was more expensive, and doesn't have the convenience of of folding into a storage bin,  but will last for years."
0,1,"This is great!  It has gotten a few tears in it.  The way it folds up makes it a great carry all for travel, unfold it and you have a playmat!"
0,1,I purchased this to go with my figure collection.  The figure itself is large and has great detail.  The packaging arrived in great condition and is very sturdy.
0,1,"Truly a most aptly named product! It immediately produced a gazillion bubbles, which it blew out everywhere.  What a great invention."
0,1,"Let's just say that the programming of the wireless unit this toy comes with is just about the most frustrating thing I have ever encountered in all my years experience with electronic items.  It is similar to programming a universal remote, but even more complicated.  Method 1 has you point your remote at the unit, and go through a series of annoying commands, in a very annoying voice (my son kept screaming for me to stop this method due to the awful voice).  The muffled voice you hear when you test it in the store, is similar to the muffled programming female voice, but luckily, when you get this device going, the sound no longer comes out of the unit, but rather it's all done through the TV (one high point).After 1 of 3 methods to program this device, you have to test it with the test DVD.  Method 1 failed for the two times that I tried it.  I skipped Method 2 because my DVD player was not listed in the back of the booklet, so I would have had to try at least 17 codes for the brand name of my player.  I went to Method 3 and tried that for countless minutes, just standing there like and idiot, pointing the thing at the dvd player and pressing the code search button dozens upon dozens of times, only to give up, as none of them worked.I then went back to method 2 and picked a code from a model simliar to my DVD player, and lo and behold, it worked!  Sadly, after my son played the game once, the unit somehow reset itself and I had to reprogram it all over again.  After a few times now, it seems to be staying programmed.As far as the DVD stories you play, all are excellently illlustrated and narrated, however the words that go along with the story appear at the bottom, and as the narrator speaks, each word is highlighted in red.  With a white background, and black lettering, and a very colorful story being shown, the red highlights of these thin letters do nothing to prompt my 4-year-old (who has some reading skills) to look at them.  I feel the letters should have been bolder, with a stronger emphasis on each word, instead of a slight italic and turning to red.  There is no time between lines, as the next sentence is started immediately (unless there is a question to be answered in game play mode) so there is no time to reflect and re-read the sentence, unless you opt for the boring read to yourself mode.I think these discs are more apt to perk the reading skills of 6 & 7 year olds, as younger kids will just be interested in the games and questions, and colorful pictures, rather than reading the sentences.  Let's face it, immature children under 6 are use to watching movies on screen, not reading sentences, so it's harder for them to free their mind of the visual aspect, and concentrate on words and what this is suppose to teach.  I feel a simple book would teach the younger ones reading better than this can.The glitches I mention are that sometimes, when you press the asterisk for a question about the page you just read, it replays the same exact question you just answered.  Also, in the Where the Wild Things are DVD, there is one question where it asks the viewer how many monsters are on screen.  Well, technically there are 6, as they enlarge 5 of them from the background screen, however they don't fully cut off one monster in the background, so there are 6 on screen, yet the answer choices are 2, 5, & 7, which really agitated my son, because he knew there were clearly 6 monsters on the TV.The discs do have some fun games, like the Dress Corderoy game on the Corderoy DVD, so there are lots of other educational aspects other than just reading.  I think as a reading tool, this would be better suited for 5-7 year olds, and the 3-5 year olds have a better time answering the questions and playing the games than reading the sentences to the narrated story."
0,1,"I have always loved Scooby Doo, and this is a great take on the Guess Who? games.  I purchased this game in order to convert it to a more adult version of a favorite show (&#34;Are You Being Served?&#34;), but I would recommend the Scooby Doo version for kids of all ages.  Very easy to assemble.  My one minor complaint is the packaging:  other versions of the Guess Who? games come in a box with a lid; this version opens on the side, so it's not as convenient for storage.  Given that I'm redoing the game in a different way, it's not that big a deal for me because I will be discarding the box; however, some buyers who intend to keep the game in its original box may find it discouraging, especially for little hands (box could get torn up through use)."
0,1,"Ideal for parties, this abstract game puzzles the logical skills in people of all ages. Ideal to share with friends and family"
1,0,"My son got this for Christmas and we like it.  It is fun, fast and easy to play.  We like games that enable you to ""visit"" while you play and it not be so intense that you get frustrated by distractions.  This was a winner, and my son loves to destroy my castle!  Definite hit!"
0,1,"This game is a lot simpler than I expected it to be. It's almost tic-tac-toe like. I played it a few times and was pretty underwhelmed. I think it has potential for younger kids who want to play something strategic, but older kids/adults will probably be bored after a little while."
0,1,"I gave this game to my sister and her husband for Christmas and they loved it.  It is fairly easy to learn and the games do not require a long time commitment, unlike many strategy games. I enjoyed this game so much, I bought 3 more - one for my grandparents, one for my mentor student and one for myself.  It reminds me of UNO with different ""house"" rules that can be added to make the strategy more complex.  I'm still looking for an efficient way to ""shuffle"" the tiles.  It is an inexpensive game for 1, 2, 3 or 4 players that I can play several times a night."
0,1,"Great game for the whole family, and there is even an individual player option. Kids are 7 and 9 and we all enjoy, lots of alternative modes of play."
0,1,"This is my second favorite Gamewright game. I really love Frogjuice, but this game is really excellent. It's pretty easy to learn, but there is enough variety to make it interesting the whole time and for many games. You can tell when a game has been well designed and thought out, and this one definitely has. Definitely recommended."
0,1,"Great game with great rules.  Just as fun, if not more fun to play in teams.  I really like the artwork on the cards, which is important for card games.  Being a card game, I can see the cards showing wear after a while, but mine have not yet after a year's worth of play.  A lot of strategy required to win this game, and typically not the same strategy from one game to the next.  All kids (over 7 or so) and kids at heart will love this game.  I am 27 and love to play with my grandparents.  Great game at just the right price.  Pick it up, and be happy you did so!"
0,1,"We love this game.  We bought it as an Easter present for our four year old son.  It is easy to teach and plays very quickly.  It teaches basic math skills and is a GREAT way to get kids to practice counting.  The theme and art are a perfect fit for the targeted age range and for those even slight younger than the target.Again, we play this with our four year old son and we finish usually in about 20 minutes for a 3 player game.  While the grand strategy available in this game escapes the younger player it is still an enjoyable experience for them.  For a group of adults this game can be a great warm up/filler game for a game night.  It really challenges the players to think and plan along with rewarding the player who can keep tabs on what has been played.I simply can't recommend this game enough.  Bonus: since it is just a single deck of cards it is a great travel game for vacations!"
0,1,"As with 'Rat a Tat Cat' this card game is a game of strategy. The play and turn around is pretty quick. My 12 and 7 year olds love this, especially the 7 year old. He especially loves stealing my queens!! It's an enjoyable game for parents too, since turnaround is fairly quick"
0,1,I wasn't sure how this card game would go over with my nieces. Although they had everyone playing it during our vacation. It was fun for everyone - even my 5 year old son :)
1,0,"My daughter received this game as a birthday present, and she really likes it! She finds it to be a lot of fun, and our other family members are enjoying playing it, too. The age on the package suggests that ages 8 and up play it, but my daughter is 6. She is just learning her addition, and this game is a big helper! She likes to learn through games (we homeschool), and this game is a great addition to our math games."
0,1,"Game Wright, the makers of this game, is a family-based company from Massachusetts that designs many games with out-of-the-box goals and rules, that require some creativity and some calculation.  Sleeping Queens is a game that we consistently return to play.  The challenges are easy to understand, the graphics are delightful, and the educational value is embedded into a mildly competitive game with some strategy.Twelve queens are placed face down.  The challenge is to amass enough queens and collect enough points (each queen is worth a certain number of points) to win the game.  Depending on the number of people playing, this usually means collecting 4 to 6 queens.  The queens have amusing names and costumes (rainbow, cat, dog, rose, etc).  They are not the scary queens of fairy tales or Alice in Wonderland, but more like amused princesses waiting for an intellect to rescue them.The queens are awakened by kings, who themselves are collected by chance (not valor, alas).  Dragon cards can steal queens.  Sleeping potions take your queens away (thus the name).  Wand cards defend against the magic potion, and knights defend against dragons.  By collecting these cards, players can prevent other players' strategies.No reading is involved, so the game is easy to learn for kids who are not yet reading.  However, kids may need a little help adding up their points to know whether they've collected enough points.  Although it is a competitive game, it requires an assortment of skills: planning to get queens, offensive attack, defensive strategy, addition of points, and memory to remember where high point queens are (queens are all face down).  We love this game.  The cards are laminated card stock and are sturdy, but they are paper after all.  The graphics are simply wonderful.  It's for ages 8 and up, but younger kids will love it too."
1,0,"My 8 year old and I really enjoy playing this game together.  It's fun, has the right mix of thought (adding card points), strategy appropriate for an 8 year old (whether to steal or not a queen), and fun (cards are beautifully illustrated and very silly.The play is very straightforward - there are 12 sleeping queens and you 'awaken' them with a king card.  But knights can steal an awakened queen, dragons can defeat nights, potions can put an awakened queen to sleep, and a wand can stop a potion.  Queens have points - get enough points and you win.  In addition, to keep the game moving, there are numbered cards that have their own way of being played to help you draw more cards each turn.In all - highly recommended.  We love it!"
1,0,"We've been playing this game as a family with my five year old niece since she was only *four* years old.She can play her own hand, and often she wins against the grown-ups! (We don't let her win. There's no point.)She does need a little help in adding her cards to discard them, and we play that it's five queens to win, no matter what (even if you have the required 50 points, you still need the right number of queens), but otherwise she totally manages her own game.Her little sister (two and a half years) can totally play a game too... if she has a grown-up (or sometimes her big sister) to help her put distinguish the various power cards. I have no doubt that she, too, will be managing her own hand when she's four... or even three, she's catching up fast.We've also played this game with just adults a few times, it's really pretty fun and very fast."
0,1,This is a companion piece for the doll I bought last year.  I won't actually know how it is rated until my grandniece plays with it.
0,1,"shipping on time. the picture doesn't do justice.  it's cute, light and my daughter loves it.  I put her diaper and nic nacs in the bag and strap her dolly on the front and we're ready to go.  cute cute cute!"
0,1,"We purchased this for our 2 year old for Christmas and were surprised at the small size of the backpack.  That said, she is 2 and she doesn't really need a backpack that is much bigger than this.  This backpack holds her baby bottle, duck, extra clothes, and pretty much anything and everything else she manages to squeeze in there =).  She uses it every day to carry her baby Stella doll whom she takes every where with her.  She is able to manage putting the backpack on and taking it off by herself which is nice.My biggest complaint though is that while this is designed to hold Baby Stella, the velcro straps are sooooo short that I have to put the doll in the backpack for my daughter.  She simply cannot do it.  I have to stretch the straps just to make the doll fit and sometimes they pop back off.  I am not sure if we just happened to get one like this or if that is the standard for all the backpacks, but it can be frustrating when I am in the middle of something and I need to put her baby back in the backpack.  I've noticed that she has been taking Stella out of the backpack less and less each day because she too is tired of having to ask for help with putting her doll in the backpack.  I think I am going to make some strap extenders for the backpack so as to help her gain some more independence when playing with this toy."
0,1,"My granddaughter thinks she is a Princess, and loves all the Pinkalicious books.  This doll is perfect for her! Thanks."
0,1,"My daughter picked this out from the picture on the computer screen.  We both thought it would be larger, but she does like it.  It is a softer doll, not hard plastic, which is what she wanted, and why she likes it.  Arrived in great condition, looks like picture."
0,1,"I bought this doll for my 4 year old niece.  She loves princesses and this is a big hit.  She loves the clothes, the hair, the size and the belly button.  She takes it with her when visiting Grandma because it's easy to carry.  I recommend this."
0,1,I had one of these as a kid and was thrilled to find it in a toy store. I wish I had kept my old one. The pump handle came right off the third time my son tried to fire it off.
0,1,"Has funny and racy questions. Only play with friends, it is definitly not meant to be played with family. And its really fun to play with drinks."
0,1,"Everybody can enjoy it, we had very dissimilar age groups, from 15 to 70, even kids 7+ will learn and start playing in 10-15 min, rules are pretty easy even for people not used to board games; they recommend 8+ players, and it's true, the more, the better, I think up to 18 can play; perfect for a teen or tweenage party, camping and if a little obscure the better. And it's pretty affordable."
0,1,"We started playing when a co-worker brought them in for lunch and now we all own a set of cards.  A great group game, easy to play and so much fun.  Highly recommend!"
0,1,"Best game ever! You get 24 cards. You can play with any number of people up to 23, but more than around 8 are needed to make the game really fun. Pass out the cards randomly to people. They will be a villager or a special character who lives in Miller Hollow. Our group makes up character names and occupations to make the game more fun. At night, some of the people who are werewolves come alive and eat villagers. There are other special characters who can save, kill, etc. villagers on their own accord. Each morning it will be revealed by the narrator who got eaten. Then the villagers get to vote one person off the island, only you lynch them instead of letting them get away. After the lynching you get to find out if you did indeed get one of the hidden werewolves among you or if you hung and innocent villager. In the end, you want the villagers to win and the werewolves to lose. Check out my review about the expansion pack before buying!!"
0,1,"I needed a pair of shin guards for an intro to soccer class for my 5-year-old. These fit the bit perfectly, though I would probably invest in something of higher quality, or the shin guard socks, if my child was more seriously involved in the sport."
0,1,"I bought two sets. My sons like it, it is good partner in sand or beach. but handles of the bag is weak. it come unstruck."
0,1,"My toddler loves the sifter... some of the other toys, like the shovel is quite thin and can break easily.  But for the price, you get a lot of things."
1,0,"Grandson played for hours with these, there was enough to share with other kids. Easy to clean and store for next visit."
0,1,My grandson loves these toys. Perfect toys to put in his crabbie sandbox. I am sure he will have hours of fun this summer.
1,0,Sturdy beach toys and the bag lasted the whole trip. My toddlers used this kid every day for a week and all the toys lasted. Good purchase.
1,0,I remember having an Erector set and not being able to make much.  Luckily I now have a creative and mechanically inclined younger cousin.  I love family get-togethers since now I can watch him build things with this set and I get to help!  He's made most of the sets in the booklet but prefers to build from imagination.  I'm hoping he'll take this passion and maybe get into those Goldberg machine contests in a few years!
1,0,"A few things to note -This is one of the more difficult sets to build. I say this having built the motorized crane, the plane in the multi model 10, and the propeller plane in the 10-model set.For this set, of the 15 sets pictured I've made two, the featured excavator and the tow truck. Both were royal pains. The cables and springs that control these sets are difficult to properly tension, and the sets like to fall apart due to the shaking when moving. Also the treads aren't very forgiving. Pull too hard and they'll tear.The excavator was pretty straight forward to build, at several steps you may want a friend to give a third hand. Also make sure that any bolt that doesn't look like is supposed to act like a hing, make sure you tighten until stuck. Otherwise with the slightest bit of use, it'll fall off. This set took me about 90 minutes to build.The tow truck had several steps that were confusing, and at least one step that was just outright wrong. It wasn't until looking at the final image that I was able to correct it. Unfortunately the cables don't do very much in this build. For this, and the difficult tensioning is the reason I'm rating this 4 stars.I know the box says 8+, but I would not recommend this for anyone under 10. The instructions are much more confusing than k'nex or lego."
0,1,The blocks were very easy to put together and didn't take long at all.  It is a great tool for the imagination and seems long lasting.
0,1,"I remembered these blocks from when my kids were little but was concerned about the quality of these blocks.  I purchased these for my 18 month old grandson and my daughter and I are both impressed at how sturdy they are when put together.  My grandson climbs on them, sits and walks on them, destroys his towers, and they still look new.  I am considering ordering another set so he will have more blocks to work with since the smallest ones are not played with much."
1,0,"My 2 girls love playing with these blocks, we end up playing with these at least once a day.  Big enough to make a fort out of and are very durable for being made out of cardboard."
0,1,"I bought these for my sons 6 months ago. I can't believe how well they have held up! My 3 year old is very rough with toys. These blocks have been through lots of abuse and most of them are still in great shape. My 42 pound child has stood on these blocks! Several have holes and tears from heavy, nontypical use, but they still stack and work perfectly! I am very pleased with these! I wish this package came with more of the red, bigger blocks, but I was aware of what I was purchasing."
0,1,"My daughter was extremely interested in how I crack eggs when we make eggs so when I found this toy, one of the only non-plastic egg toys that actually 'cracks' I was thrilled.Unfortunately, these eggs are a little smaller than I anticipated.I would have been fine with this as my daughter knows not to put anything in her mouth but other kids in her playgroup (all under 2 years of age) aren't.Once the eggs crack, the pieces are small enough for a young toddler to put in his/her mouth and possibly get stuck.The deal breaker for me was that even if a kid doesn't put the halves in his/her mouth, it was nearly impossible to actually 'crack' the egg.  At one point I though I might have to get a wrench to pry the pieces apart.  It was so frustrating for our daughter that she doesn't even play with these eggs anymore.  She plays with the wooden eggs and pretends they crack or plays with the handful of plastic eggs she received at an Easter egg hunt.  She takes the sunny side egg and stuffs it in the plastic egg.It would be nice if these eggs were slightly bigger to avoid being a choking hazard and if the eggs 'broke' in less of a smooth fashion so it makes breaking them easier for a child.Save your money.  Your child and you will not find these as much fun."
0,1,"Gave this set to my 2 year old (26 mo old) grandson for Christmas.  He enjoys playing with it!  It looks just like the pictures and the pieces seem to be good quality, sturdy plastic with smooth edges.  I think he will get at least a few years play out of this set."
0,1,Purchased this mixer for my granddaughter to use in her new Cook n Grow Kitchen she is getting at Christmas.  She had played with one similar to this at relaties house and loved it.
0,1,This is by far one of cutest simple toys I've ever seen! Adorable! The snails body actually moves up and down kind of like an inch worm would. So cute. My twin nineteen month old boys Love it too. They love pulling it around! I wish I could rare it higher! If you have toddlers you should get this! In fact I bought another one for a friends twin toddlers.
1,0,"This snail is so cute! It's durable and colorful. If it gets flipped over, it still works. Easy for a toddler to pull along no matter if it's right side up, or upside down. Seems well designed."
0,1,"Plan Toys do not disappoint!  These little pieces are very well made.  Our daughters drag around the little vacuum - vacuuming our house - and over a year later, nothing has broken.  Nicely detailed and lovely."
0,1,"I really love this, it is so cute. Very durable and good quality. Someone else said that the teddy fits perfectly in the crib, and it kinda does, but it is a little big. Also the easel had a hard time standing up on its own because the red leg that holds it up was too long, but I cut about a half inch off and its fine now. The skateboard is great because it has rubber wheels. Overall, we really like it"
0,1,"We bought this off of Zulily as a Christmas gift for our then 18 month old. It is very well made and quite adorable. I like that it has a good amount of storage for the play food and dishes and the accessories it comes with are so cool. I do agree that it is a bit small for the target age that is listed, but everyone really enjoys it anyway; children from 12 months to 6 years have gravitated towards this great little kitchen at our home. The construction is solid and the accessories are great, especially for this price."
0,1,"My sis gets this one, but I still love her! I love the new My Scene, Mattel deiantly studied hard for these! I know some people think it's a bit showy(on the belly and top), but it is defiantly fashion. I'm not so crazy about the design of the second dress, but it is a beautiful blue. Look at all of those Blingy acessories, and I just love the boots...SO RAD! I 100% recommend her if you are a My Scene fan!Chelsea Churro...Over, and OUT!!!"
0,1,All my kids had this when they were little & they loved it.  So when I came across it I knew I had to get one for my nephew!  I HIGHLY recommend this!!!
0,1,"I have had this toy for over 5 years, and my 2nd child is just playing with it again now.  This toy is durable, cute, and educational.  Both of my kids loved it."
0,1,My 2 yr old loves this piggy. The coins are large and colorful. The pig has different settings for more music or counting. He loves to play with it.
0,1,"My daughter received this piggy when she was about one and it has been used on a regular basis ever since (she is now 3).  It's one of those toys that every kid who comes over goes straight to!  It doesn't have so many functions that it's confusing for small children (many toys' keys/buttons respond differently each time you push them).  It has a music function and a counting function. It helped my daughter develop hand/eye coordination, later, matching, then counting.  The big and small coins kind of go together: for example the big coins have an adult animal and the small coins have the corresponding baby animal, so it helped her learn not only animals' names but also big & small, sorting, matching colors, and matching animals.  A couple of things that I noticed are that it will count to ten whether you have ten coins or not (like if you have 9 coins and put one in twice) and that the door did fall off quite a few times (but it is easily replaced).  Its voice is friendly and not too loud, the music is fun, and it stores well since the coins go inside the belly.  Every kid who comes over wants to play with this piggy; we have gotten more than our money's worth from him and are quite pleased with the purchase.  I just bought another one for a birthday gift for our friend's two-year-old son."
0,1,"Great toy.  We've had ours for almost 2 yrs.  It is durable, entertaining, and educational.  My 3 yr old still plays with it regularly, and my 1 yr old loves it too.  Would purchase again.  Nice, uncomplicated toy at a decent price."
1,0,High quality toy for a very reasonable price.  A year later and he is still in great shape from my two boys playing with them in the theatre.
0,1,Both of my sons loved this toy and used it for everything from shopping to pretending it was a garbage truck!  It lasted longer than I expected but eventually became bent and came apart.  Very lightweight and easily bent.
0,1,"This is alot smaller than its visual and measurements, but works out great for my hardwood/carpeted floor and small one-family home that is already filled to the max with toys. It compliments our small-sized corner kitchen and table area for use by our son. It has been difficult to find a cart that isn't pink or bulky. This cart is very light weight and small and not completely metal, as the description led me to believe. It was easy to assemble."
0,1,"Purchased for our 3 and 1 year olds - they get a lot of play from it.  The only con is that you have to put the stickers on yourself - I'm not great at applying curved stickers into grooved spaces.  The sticker are vinyl though so they are easily wiped clean and won't rip easily.Yes, would buy again...Plus,  Step2 toys are made in the USA!!!"
1,0,"I am a licensed child care provider, and I have mostly boys.  Ages 2-7 have all enjoyed this toy!  My kids play with cars all day long, and I knew that they would enjoy this toy and I was hoping it'd provide hours of entertainment.  Today is the first day playing with it, and they LOVE it but I should've went ahead and purchased more trians when I ordered it.  They fought over the 3 trains so much that I had to take them away until the trains that I just ordered today arrive.  They can still use cars, but that was a little disappointing that I didn't forsee that issue! :P  My own fault! So be warned... get more trains so they kids aren't fighting over taking turns with the only 3 trains that it comes with! :)"
1,0,For the price the value is EXCELLENT. You are getting a table with the tracks attached so no pieces to lose! You can put the cover on and instant art table. Hot wheels and the smaller Thomas trains fit on it too. My son loves it and so do all the kids who come over to play. My son climbs on it and he is large for his age - so I know it is extremely durable (as are most Step 2 items. I highly recommend this table.
0,1,"My son loves cars, trucks and trains so this was a no brainer.  He loves it and it seems extremely durable.  The only pain is putting the decals on, they took about 30 minutes."
0,1,"This is a super alternative to the usual train tables with removable tracks. I love that there's no mess in my living room from this, and my 2-year-old daughter loves to play with it. She has the wooden trains that come with it and a Thomas train that works just fine with it.I had a few minor problems with it, but certainly recommend it highly despite these problems-- it's an excellent toy and priced well.-Stickers: it was difficult to get the stickers lined up properly, and two of them keep bubbling up no matter how well I stuck them down. I wish Step 2 would design it with the decals already in place, or painted on.-Lid: mine arrived damaged, and I called Step 2 for a replacement. It's a pain, though, to figure out what to do with the lid while the toy is in use. It's large and a bit delicate because it's not plastic, but a cheap board. I wish this part was better designed to fit into the toy somehow, and/or to be made of more durable material (why not plastic like the rest of the toy?).-Trains: one of mine was glued wrong so it didn't fit the other two pieces, and again, Step 2 replaced it when they replaced the lid.Aside from that, my daughter is enjoying this very much, and Step 2 has done it again with an innovative and long-lasting toy."
0,1,"Ordered this for my 1 and 2.5 yr old boys. This is soooooo much better than the $200-$300 wooden table. The tracks are modled in the plastic which is great, no more broken tracks. Highly durable. Works with all Thomas trains. The battery powered ones kind of work, some of the tunnels are too narrow, but the Take-Along and Wooden Thomas engines are perfect and just about all cars fit too. Bought from Amazon with free super saver shipping on Dec 10 at night and got it on Dec 21, just in time for christmas. I love Amazon."
0,1,my twins got one for christmas and loved it and spends many hours in a day playing with this!so i bought one for my cousins son who is the same age as my boys!he loves it just as much as them!fits match box cars and most toy trains!very happy!very recommended!ONE FLAW ! if you dont have a drill purchase one unless you have very strong hands that can screw in to heavy plastic with no pre-drilled holes!
1,0,"Finally, a track that you can't lose parts of and one that won't come apart if you breathe on it too hard. My 2.5YO son loves trains and cars but the tracks were becoming quite a hazard and nuisance. We don't have room to set up all of the tracks that he has and when we alternate them, they either have missing pieces or come apart as soon as they are walked across or another toy comes in contact with it.This thing is a perfect solution. There are very few vehicles that don't fit on here and it is so nice having everything all together instead of strewn all over the place to be broken or stepped on.We got a rechargeable Hot Wheels for like $8 or $9 and my son literally screams with delight when we put it on this track. But he also loves it with his manual cars, trucks and trains. We all crowd around it and have fun!It is large but is worth the space especially since it has the nice durable cover that can turn it into an instant art table."
1,0,My grandkids love it.  Still playing with it a year later.  Holds up well.  They also use matchbox cars on it.
1,0,"My boys got this for XMas last year, so it's seen about 6 mos of play. It is a great train table- lightweight, lots of fun tracks and easier/ less expensive than a wooden train set.The negative is that a few of the tracks are attached in with plastic screws. As you might imagine these come loose all the time and disappear (my boys are two and five). We haven't lost any for good-yet. But it would be a real shame if we did as then there would be this random opening in the track. I've seen this table at other facilities and they have the same problem, so I know it's not just mine.I've had to ask my husband to replace the plastic screws with actual screws that will keep the tracks in place."
0,1,"This table has been worth every penny! We wanted something that wasn't too expensive and could double as a play table. This is perfect!  Gave it to our son for Christmas and he still plays with it every day. He loves the three piece train that came with it. They have plastic hooks that connect them instead of magnets, which frustrated him for some months. Now he will say &#34;mommy fix&#34; when he wants them put back together.  They are painted wood and made in China (if you are concerned about toys made in China).  They look cheap and I was concerned with durability but they have held up well with numerous throws across the room.The table is plastic so of course it's not going to be shaped perfectly. There is one piece of the track that doesn't lay flush but it doesn't upset him when the train crashes. The tracks are interesting with several different paths and the hills are fast!  Be prepared to attach long, curvy stickers for the tracks. This was the annoying part of assembly. Very easy to put together.We bought Fisher-Price Thomas the Train Talking Engines - Thomas, Henry, James, Spencer and Diesel. He LOVES them and plays with them all day every day. They run about $10 at Walmart.  You press a button and their light shines and they say different sayings from the show. They also have the magnets that can connect to either side of another train. They aren't the round flat magnets on other Thomas trains that frustrate kids when they won't stick."
0,1,Can't blow bubbles appropriately unless the handles are pushed down in order to allow a lot of pressure to be placed on the back wheels. Only the height of an adult makes that possible. Very disappointed.
0,1,My almost 2 year old loves this so much that he would sleep with it every night if I let him! All his friends at daycare love it too!
0,1,"This was a gift from my grandmother to my 2 year-old son on his birthday. A &#34;mower like daddy's!&#34; which I'm sure you can all related to. :)  And it works great. Has a cool noise and blows bubbles like a champ. Designed to be pushed in grass, which is smart. It has held up 100% and is a go-to yard toy for my son. We all love it!"
0,1,My granddaughter loves this she pushes it all over the yard and down the driveway.We never could get the bubbles to work but she doesn't care she still mows and works on the motor over and over.She loves the sound and enjoys the fun.
0,1,"My 2 year old carries this baby around everywhere. She has two others (one that an aunt gave her that makes noise and moves, etc) and this is her favorite by far. The vanilla scent is really quite nice, and I'm not a person who likes scented things. The face is very sweet, although you can't tell by the photos online that she has two front teeth.My one and only complaint is that the clothes are not that high quality. She has had the doll for about a month and the suit is pilly already. She does sleep with it every night and throws it around the floor (she has 2 older brothers so is not the most gentle and girly of all girls) so that could be a factor in the state of the clothes.Overall I would highly recommend this doll, especially for the price."
0,1,"This is a cute and cuddly baby doll for our toddler granddaughter. Soft and cuddly, it is a favorite for two granddaughters under 3 years old."
0,1,I purchased this for my daughter who is 14 months old.  It is the perfect size for her to carry around.  She is not as attached to it as I expected her to be but I don't regret the purchase at all. The clothes on the baby doll are well made and she smells like vanilla.  Adorable doll!
0,1,"Bought this for my daughter's first birthday!  She cuddles it, and kisses it, and sings to it!  It is so sweet and so realistic!  She loves that the eyes open and close!"
0,1,the size and weight of this doll are great for little hands and it smells great too! love this doll.
0,1,I bought this doll for my 17month old granddaughter.  She absolutely loves her and carries her all over the house.  The doll is soft and her features are so pretty.  Very satisfied with this product.
0,1,"I was looking for a doll for my soon to be 2 year old's birthday. After reading about dolls in general, I decided I definitely wanted Corolle dolls (I also have a 4 year old and bought her a Les Cheries). I originally bought the Les Classiques for the 2 year old based on the manufacturer's recommended age, but when I received it, I was very disappointed in how huge it was. Way too big for a 2 year old to carry around, and just looks wrong. I don't know why - just not the right size for a doll. The Les Cheries arrived the same day and I loved it - it will be perfect for my 4 year old, but I digress... so I returned the Les Classiques and thought I'd give this one a try. My other choice was getting a cloth waldorf-style doll. I really want a doll that will become &#34;the&#34; doll and have an heirloom quality to it. This doll arrived today and I love it. I mean, LOVE IT. It's the perfect size, has a very satisfying weight to it, and of course the vanilla smell is divine. The clothes are very simple and cute and easy to remove, and the hat is tight enough that I suspect it has a chance at staying on the doll's head for more than a few minutes :) The arms and legs and face details are so precious. I didn't realize how crappy our other dolls are until I saw this one. It's truly beautiful, like a real baby. Ultimately, though I tend to like more natural fabrics and toys and shy away from plastic, the vinyl body on this doll makes it more lifelike than any cloth doll will ever be, and I suspect my daughter will love it. I immediately just wanted to cuddle it when I saw it! If you're considering a doll for your toddler, I can't imagine something better than this."
0,1,Rocks and wood achieve the same goal and are free and let's not forget to mention you can do ALOT more with rocks and wood.  Let them use their imagination.
0,1,"Wow! I am so excited that I have found these! I have played with various brand wooden tracks for about 20 years now... both with a brother, when babysitting as a teenager, as an aunt, and now with my own children.  One of the most frstrating things with these sets, especially with elevated sections, is the track coming apart.  These things work GREAT to connect straight pieces, curved peices, and everything in between.  A bit tricky for small kids to insert and use on their own, but really helpful for reducing frustration at track falling apart (Both for the child and for the parent hearing ""Mooooooommmmmmmyyyyyyyyy it broken!!!"" every five minutes!! :)Box comes with 12 pieces, so for anything over a basic set order a couple of boxes (I had to go back and order more!) Enjoy!"
0,1,"These little clips are awesome. We use them with our Thomas wooden railway to keep the tracks from coming apart, especially at key points like corners, ends of bridges, etc. They might just save you from a train related meltdown if your kid comes unglued when the tracks do!"
1,0,"The instructions are horribly written and the picture on the cover? You need to work at this for up to three years to get a terrarium of that magnitude.If you decide to give it a shot, clear out a space in your fridge for it and be prepared to devote a good amount of time to it. Our friends actually do have things growing in theirs, so I believe it is possible. But you have to be very diligent with it."
0,1,"The premise of this game is that, over a three day span, numerous nobles will be beheaded via the guillotine. There isn't anything you can do about it except for collecting the heads of the most valuable ones. It is a little gruesome in premise but the game relies heavily on strategy and card play.Every day a dozen new nobles are lined up for the Guillotine. You and your fellow players can alter the order and the make-up of the line with the cards you are dealt. Move nobles backward or forward in order to collect the more valuable ones or stick your opponents with less valuable or even penalty laden nobles.At the end of the third day you add up your card values and the player with the most points wins the game. It takes about 30-45 minutes to play a game and can go much faster with experienced players.I've never been much of a French historian but I was told by a friend that many of the individuals described actually were involved or truly beheaded during this time of history. Kudos to the game crew for historical accuracy.You will enjoy this game even though the premise is grisly and it can be replayed enjoyably for many years."
1,0,"One of the few games that also works for 2 or 3, this is a lot of fun and the pictures are funny too!  The point is to re-arrange the characters such that you 'collect' the ones worth the highest points (as noted on the character card).  There is room for strategy here, but plenty of luck, so it's a great game for adults to play with kids as well."
0,1,"This game is fun for everyone.  Very easy setup and game play.  The ""rules"" are on the cards themselves, so there is no need to memorize anything but the way your turn works - play a card, decapitate, draw a card.  The game's fun comes from its simplicity.  The artwork on the cards is humorous, and well drawn - something I find to be very important in a card game.  I am in my mid twenties and play this game almost every week with friends.  If you're looking for loads of fun without all of the complexity of other card games (and even board games), look no further.The only problem I see with this game is the durability.  It is a card game, and as such, I can see the cards wearing over time.  There is also a little cardboard (of sorts) guillotine that definitely wears down after many many uses.  The good news is that the cardboard piece is not a necessity for gameplay, it is just there as a fun little crutch.I have owned this game for over a year now, and it continues to be fun after hundreds of games.  The games go so quickly that it is easy to play five games in one sitting.  This is nice because you can do the 'best out of three' or 'best out of five' thing.  Regardless of age and gaming experience, this is a great game.  Pick this one up since it is relatively inexpensinve, you'll be glad you did!"
0,1,"A friend of mine loves Guillotine, and so it's a game we play every so often. It's a little morbid when you think about the fact that this is a game about the french revolution, and all the peasants killing the royals and upper class. However, the cartoon styling and funny action cards help remove the dark theme to the game.In Guillotine, there are a limited amount of &#34;Days&#34; in which players are allowed to collect nobles. When a player turn comes, they take the first of the line, but they are allowed to play one action card that can effect others or the line. When a line is empty, a new day begins.WHAT DID I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME:Action cards really add to this game so it's not just a &#34;Grab the First in Line&#34; card, taking it out of the &#34;Luck of the Draw&#34; factor. Characters are cartoons and drawn in a way to make you snicker. Some of the royals are very fun and interesting.WHAT DID I DISLIKE ABOUT THE GAME:The fact that there are cards in the action deck that allow other players to end the game faster, and effect the game timeline dynamics is something I really dislike. When you sit down to a game, you know that someone might win, but you still think you have the time table to make some changes and possibly win at the last minute, but cards that end the day early can take that all away from you.WHO IS THIS GAME DESIGNED FOR?This game is designed with people with a morbid sense of humor. However it can be enjoyed by normal people to due to it's easy and fun game dynamics. It's also a game you could probably play with children, but personally I wouldn't suggest it.RATING!6.1 out of 8. I like this game, but I just don't feel like it has anything special that pulls it out of the once every so often play pile."
1,0,"I'm not rating this game a 5 because it's one of the best games I've ever played (it's probably more of a 3 or 4), I'm rating it a 5 for what it is: a tremendously fun filler at the beginning or end of the night that doesn't require too much thinking.Really, the only complaint I have is the Piss Boy card.  I know that most will probably think that's a funny name and card, but I found it unnecessary and crude.  However, if you don't want to play with that card or don't want your kids to play with it, pulling it out of the deck in no way affects the game play.  So, don't let that stop you from buying a light game that can be immensely enjoyed by gamers and non-gamers alike."
0,1,I wouldn't suggest you play this game all the time - the novelty will wear off - but it's lots of fun played as an occasional time-killer.It's very easy to learn because mostly all you're doing is picking an action card from your hand and doing what that action card says. Very self-explanatory.
0,1,I bought this product for my 4 year old grandson's birthday.  He believes he is a pirate and I think that you should fuel a child's imagination.  He will be receiving it as a birthday gift and I believe he will be quite excited.
0,1,My son got this for Christmas.  It is s a nice wooden box that contains a treasure trove of pirate goodies.  There is a hidden panel in the bottom of the box for special treasures. It is good quality.  The only thing I would change is that the coins are very plastic looking and not shiny gold like my little pirate wishes they were.
0,1,I bought this 2 years ago. We've used this at the beach twice now for the kids treasure hunts. They loved it. The chest has been buried in the sand twice and still looks new. It's also the perfect size!
0,1,If you have pirate lover he or she will love this chest.  My son felt very important having this chest!!!!!!!!!
1,0,Definitely the nicest pirate toy chest we've ever seen. The details are great for a toy. The little secret compartment is a nice touch as well. The only complaint from the kids was that they wish that the chest was completely filled with gold.
0,1,"This is a great toy, nicely made, feels good to touch, I don't mind looking at it in my living room.  But as a teaching toy it has just one trick, and is really suited to a much younger age range than you might think.  Even kids who can't name colors can tell them apart, and very young children can ""count"" even if they don't know that's what they're doing.  So the main, and only, learning objective of this toy is easily accomplished by many children well below two.  And then they're done.  I know that bright wooden pieces are good for lots of other things if you've got an imaginative child, and that's what we'll be moving on to now, as my 27 month old sorts this puzzle out in about 30 seconds.I highly recommend the Lauri Shape and Color Sorter as a substitute.  There are many more things you can do with that one.  My older children all got good use out of it throughout their preschool years.http://www.amazon.com/Lauri-Toys-Shape-Color-Sorter/dp/B00000IV8D/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=toys-and-games&qid;=1290035450&sr;=8-1"
0,1,"We loves this toy.  I bought it for my son when 15 months old and he loved it and played with it for about 6 months.  This toy is great for most 18 month olds and older.  He used to for stacking, sorting, counting, learning shapes, and more.  This is one of the best $10 toys you will ever find!  That said, if your child knows their shapes, colors, and can count to 15 don't bother as once he mastered that he was done with this toy.  This thing is pretty durable, the only marks ours had on it was teeth marks from when one of the dogs thought the triangle would make a good chew toy."
0,1,"A very well thought out activity. Not just a stacker, not just a sorter, it also presents shapes and counting 1-5 and most ingenious is that the shapes on each peg correspond to the number of that peg (i.e., triangle for 3, square for 4, pentagram for 5, etc)So we are teaching motor skills, shapes, colors, and counting at the same time."
0,1,My 4 1/2 son was super excited.. he loves to build things and hasn't stopped since he opened them.. lots and lots of hours of play ahead.. very sturdy strong pieces..going to be a family fav
0,1,"[...]It's an excellent quality toy. When we first got it my son was 12 months old and he was afraid of it until we started petting it together. Then he was always hugging it and kissing it. He is now 19 months old and he still loves all over it. He lays on it when he's relaxing. He rides it with his friends, a little more roughley now than before but that's okay because no matter how much he bashes it I know it can take it. The colors are really nice and every time some one new comes over they say ""oh what a big tiger"""
0,1,It is large and looks Great. It is very realistic looking. Luckily my son loves it but I could see where it might be a bit imposing and frightening for a little one. We love it though and it goes well in his new room with animal safari flair.
0,1,"I got my boy one of these when he was one year old. he loved it and played with it daily until he ripped it apart (his fault for being rough, not the toys, the top came off of the motor bottom with the wheels, he could still play with it, but the car part would fall off and he would drive the bare wheels and engine around) so i got two to replace the first thinking that he could play with his grandpa, what i didnt realize (maybe i am a dope) is that one control makes both move cause they are on the same frequency."
0,1,Our 3 1/2 year old granddaughter loves this toy.  She is still playing with it on December 29th.  Plays every day with it.  It is a very cute and very durable toy.  A great find and a great buy!
1,0,"This is a great classic sled.  It's made of wood and metal so it's very sturdy.  Great for single or multiple rider, but remember, you usually get more distance with more weight so it's a great sled for sledding with friends!  This type of sled works best on packed snow."
0,1,"We got this for Christmas for my 3 year old son who is fascinated by lions.  We already have the Melissa and Doug big Tiger for our five year old daughter who loves tigers, and it has been great.That being said, the lion arrived with a hole in the furry part of the tail that needed to be stitched up.  In the past month and a half another hole has opened up at the stitching in the ""arm pit.""  These were easy enough to mend, but things went from bad to worse as more and more of the stitching failed, eventually resulting in the tail falling off.Needless to say, ""Daddy Lion's"" tail falling off was of real concern to my 3 year old.I am going to contact Melissa and Doug, and will update this review to reflect what their customer service tells me.EDIT - I spoke with a very helpful person at Melissa & Doug and sent them some photos, and a new lion is in its way.  The customer service rep was surprised about the issues, and said that M&D; might request that I send the original back (at their cost) so they can see what went wrong.  I have updated the review from one star to three, and may bump this up more if the replacement is high quality.FINAL EDIT - Our replacement lion arrived yesterday, and it appears to be the high quality that we have come to expect from Melissa & Doug.  I am bumping my review of the lion up to 4 stars because of M&D;'s great customer service, and th apparent high quality of the replacement."
0,1,Nice price and good quality floaties!  They fit my 18 month old daughter well and are adjustable to her arm.
1,0,Whoever invented fabric covered floaties should be given an award. No more sticky wet arms trying to shove into hot plastic tubes. These fabric ones slip on with ease and have a strap to make tight. My daughter loves these and they really helped her build her confidence in the water.
1,0,"Sodoku itself is a great, educational game that anyone who enjoys puzzles will love. Unfortunately, this game is very poorly designed and manages to ruin the fun of Sodoku. The game has several problems:1. The screen is the worst ever! You can't see the numbers except at a certain angle, and the back lighting doesn't really work. This game will strain your eyes and give you a massive head ache.2. The stylus that comes with the game doesn't seem to work that well. I used a pen and that worked better.3. The game offers no way to check a certain square. The only error check offered is for the entire board, meaning if you make a mistake but don't want to reveal all the squares, you are out of luck.4. No way to notate squares. You cannot put a note for possible remaining numbers for any square. This makes solving tougher puzzles really frustrating.Don't buy this game. It is worthless. Save your money and get a book of puzzles. Your eyes will thank you!"
0,1,"Sons like to learn presidents and love puzzles.  Had this about 2 years now.  Like the picture and love the quality of Melissa & Doug puzzles, but on this puzzle I wish the pieces weren't jigsaw cutout shapes, but rather each president was completely shown on their own piece so it would be easier to study each person as you are searching.  It'd be even better if the president's basic facts were on the back side of each piece and this was a 2-sided puzzle.  Otherwise like it and would recommend."
0,1,"Didn't expect the pieces to be so big, but I guess that's why they call it a &#34;Floor Puzzle&#34; ...cannot use on carpet or small tables, so my son often takes up alot of my kitchen floor space. ;)"
0,1,My 3 year old grandson loves Thomas & friends wooden trains. I saw Molly for a reasonable price and gave it as a just because gift. He loved the bright yellow color and added it right to his train table.
0,1,"My 2 year old daughter loves Thomas so we bought her all the ""girl"" trains as well.  We have Molly, Emily, Lady etc. & she loves them.  Molly is really cute.  I think she's my favorite."
0,1,"We have many Game Wright games.  All of these games require some creative, out-of-the box thinking, and all of them are illustrated with beautiful, amusing graphics.  Wig Out is great example.  At first, we assumed it was a game about hairstyles and thought by the front cover that it would mainly be a game that girls would enjoy.  Not true!  We have played it with all members of the family, from 5-year-old boys to high school kids, and all have enjoyed it.The objective of the game is mainly to match characters and get rid of cards.  The first person to get rid of all her/his cards is the winner.  The game is easy to learn, and the characters in the cards are hilarious.  You have several characters of different ages, sizes, hair colors and styles (braids, pink wig, Elvis impersonator, biker dude), ethnicities.  All are gently humorous and affectionate, none are offensive.  These characters actually have names, and one of our kids loved the game so much that she memorized all the names.  It takes about 5 minutes, on average, to finish a game.  Being a card game, it is easily portable; we bring it on vacation and all of our friend and family who have played have enjoyed it too.This game is educational for preschool kids and those who may have some difficulty identifying differences.  By sorting through the cards, one can find similarities and differences between the various characters, who all appear amused and seem to be enjoying the interaction with us.  It is a great game to play with kids who are not yet reading, or who do not understand complicated rules.  The cards are on durable laminated cardstock, but they are cards, after all."
0,1,"Well i got this the other day from my dad who lives in LA so its rare i get 2 see him cuz i live in Florida but he bought me loads of crimbo prezzies he said to open 1 now. So i opened a biggish shaped present and inside was a bratz princess cloe. I left cloe un opened on my bed till my dad went home.As soon as he had gone, i ran upstairs to open my new doll. Once i opened her i admired her beauty. Cloe has a dark blonde hair colour and BROWN EYES!!! I never thought cloe could have brown eyes, Cuz i have blonde hair and brown eyes so in a way this soll is my lil twin lol. But her out fit is sweet. I dont like the skirt very much so i changed her into her denim fitted 3/4 jeans, her leopard prink jacket with a top and i kept obn her pink shoes.I ran downstairs to show my mom even my mom thought this doll was beautiful *even though my dad bought it* PMSL. My little sister Kerry * dad bought her a rock angel makeover head cloe* was jeaulous and we went shop and my mom bought us each a Jade princess doll so now i have  2 lol.I reccomend either doll to anyonePeaceEmma xxxxxxx"
0,1,"Hey!Check out Cloe.She is so cool.Like I have stated in all my other reviews(all the princess ones)Cloe is appropriate for little girls in this collection.Just so you know,the clothes really aren't that skimpy causeI make skirts out of barbie clothes and cut mine so short theybarely cover the behind of the doll.Just so you know, this doll is totally cute.And, I also recommend it.Love always,Ruby TuesdayPs-support me by putting at the bottom of your review""I support Ruby"""
0,1,"SHE IS VERY CUTE. SHE'S JUST NOT *AS* CUTE AS THE YASMIN DOLL IN MY OPINION. I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH YASMIN!!! SHE IS BY FAR THE PRETTIEST OF ALL OF THE BRATZ GIRLS. FOLLOWED BY SASHA. AND THEN BY CLOE, MEYGAN AND JADE. THIS DOLL IS STILL WORTH HAVING. I GIVE HER A 4."
1,0,My 2 year old has a sports theme br so these were perfect pillow decorations for his bed. He loves to play with them.
0,1,"Very cute stuffed balls.  My only complaint is that the basketball got a small tear in it with very minimal use.  We had to put it away because our son kept pulling the stuffing out.  Otherwise, very cute!"
1,0,"What else is there to say????  Awesome variety pack.  The kid loves hot wheels!!!  No pros or cons honestly.  Good pricing in comparison to outlet stored, etc..."
0,1,"I really did my homework before choosing a first dollhouse for my daughter, and this one does not disappoint.  I bought it for her second birthday and she LOVES it!This dollhouse has really fostered her imagination.  She calls the Mom and Dad ""Little Mommy"" and ""Little Daddy"" and has added several of her Fisher Price Little People to the family, as they fit on the chairs and on the little potty.We bought the Baby's Room set to go with it, which is great, and hopefully will be able to find the Mommy & Daddy's Bedroom set somewhere at a fair price, as they are hard to find, but are readily available on eBay for rediculous prices.My only complaint is that the movement of the arms and legs are a little stiff, making it hard for her to move them from sitting to standing position by herself, but that will become easier for her as she gets older.We are very happy with this TOO CUTE dollhouse and know that it was the best choice, very affordable, sturdy and will be with us for years to come."
0,1,"Full disclosure: My kids don't have this toy, our friends' daughter does but my kids play with it whenever we're over at their house.Our friends got this for their daughter's first birthday because they thought it was neat, but especially after seeing it I wouldn't spend money on it myself.  For starters it's very small with a lot of stuff thrown on it without a lot of though put into it.  Then it's very noisy and not pleasant music either but very annoying (to adults at least, the kids squeal with delight).  While the music is playing all these lights go off at the same time, in my opinion young children do not need that much stimulation being thrown at them every time they play.  I'm not against all electronic toys (we certainly have plenty) but this one takes it to an excessive level.  Additionally I agree with the previous reviews that the phone is a buzz kill of sorts with such a short line & the ""piano"" is worthless.  With that said though all 3 kids enjoy it; my 9mth old can easily move the beads around the wires, my 3yr old can easily fit the shapes in the holes & our friends' 15mth old can move the clock hands to noon to open the door so it's at least age appropriate."
0,1,"I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas, having loved other Parents brand toys we've bought for her. My daughter's initial reaction was fear. It's extremely loud, and needlessly so. I suppose the level of noise is supposed to imitate that of a real car, but it's really just annoying if you're a parent, and a little scary if you're a one-year old.Once she became acclamated to the level of noise it made, it did hold her interest. At the very least she found the remote to be a good chew toy, and was pleasantly surprised that the button on it did in fact move the car about. Assuming she was close enough to the car. Someone said the range is about 15 feet. Maybe they modified our model of the car to be even crappier. Once the car got about 4-5 feet away, it was hesitant to respond and acted a bit squirrely even when it did respond. At 15 feet (less, really) the remote became totally useless.I figured in time my daughter would get the hang of all these nuiances and it would probably provide a few minutes of entertainment here and there. Time was not on our side. The toy broke less than two weeks after Christmas. The remote no longer works at all - and the batteries are fine. The car will turn on, and noisily sit there with its flashing lights, but that's it. Needless to say, the small token of fun value this toy had is gone.Don't waste your money on this toy - it's a guaranteed disappointment."
0,1,"this is a sturdy, well built wagon. My 2 1/2 loves it. We got the trailer that attaches to the back and that too is a big hit. Highly recommend"
0,1,"I dont know why people are giving this low reviews simply because certain retailers (not amazon) asked way too much for it and they paid it. Its a $15.00 toy, thats what it sells for in stores. That fact that you overpayed does not make this a bad toy. Please people, read the reviews carefully and take the ""overpayers"" reviews with a grain of salt. My  6 year old loves this truck, its adorable and he plays with it alot! It was worth every cent of the $15 we paid for it."

0,1,"Let me just say that the party we had these for was a month ago, we inflated some of them a week or two early just to have fun and play with so some of these have stayed inflated now for 6 weeks and some 3 or 4.  None of mine have leaked air at all.  They were great to give as take home toys too.  Big hit at the party and weeks after as toys.  All of mine stood up.  Sometimes the elephant tipped forward because of his 'heavy head' but they are all adorable and fun."
0,1,"Good assortment of animals.  Fairly good quality, but not the best.  Great price to make up for the quality.  With kids they won't last through rough play very long, but as a decoration at an event...great deal."
1,0,"This review is actually written by Catherine L, child of Michaele L - Michaele L comments in brackets.****This little center has an x-ray center and a weighing machine [scale] and a little drawer that has a shot and a bandage inside. There is also a collar that keeps the animal from chewing itself.  Also included is a bandage and a cast.  It comes with three adorable pets [so if this is first item that you buy, you will have pets to play with in the set].  The pets included are the german shephard, a cat that drinks milk out of a bottle and a lizard.  This lizard has the chicken pox and if you rub it, the chicken pox go away.  [how cute is that!!].  The x-ray machine shows if your animal has broken a bone.This set is so much fun to play with.  My animals enjoy it and the weighing machine [scale] actually works [with the arrow above the scale reflecting a number to represent weight].  It is a very fun toy to play with [has lots of replay value and it was not hard to get it out of the box!!!].[As per many of the LPS line, the toys are durable.  The bobble-heads are well made and desite having three children, we've not lost any heads!  The product has maintained itself and is easy to clean with damp cloth. Obviously, there are small parts so this product is not recommended for the very young - the age guidelines are appropriate as mentioned.  The LPS have not disappointed and the children can play with their sets for hours.]"
0,1,"This product is essentially a light table with interchangeable discs that kids can swap in and out to trace different outfits.  Our ten-year old has no trouble at all tracing the designs, and her younger sister has fun trying.  They have taken to improvising their tracings -- there is value here beyond the discs that are included for patterns -- and they both have loads of fun coloring them in.This is not the most sophisticated toy in the world, but sometimes simplicity has its virtues.  There isn't a tremendous amount of paper included, but it doesn't take a genius to be able to trim some more paper to the dimensions that the light table requires.In all, this is an engaging toy that will give young women with creative spirits plenty to do."
0,1,"The Runway Fashions set lets kids customize and trace designs onto sheets of paper, then they can color them in.  Each fashion model is created from three sections - the head, torso and legs.  There's various fashion options for each section, so you mix and match to create unique designs.There's two types of models in this set - ""A"" and ""B"" are labelled on each ""foil"" transparency.  So you have to mix and match within a single letter set, otherwise the pose of the model doesn't match.  There's a few combinations even within a letter set don't exactly match, so some lines shouldn't be traced.The set includes a black felt tip pen, which has a fine, hard felt tip rather than a broad soft tip like most markers.  This is a good thing as it lets you draw a tight line.  For each section, you have to un-snap the lid, change out the plastic transparency foil then re-position your paper.  There's dashed lines to help you line up the existing tracing to the new section.  The clear table is fairly thin plastic, but you shouldn't need a whole lot of pressure - just enough to keep the paper flat.  Both my 10-year old and 4-year old were able to use this without any problems.  The younger one didn't get the fine details of the tracing exactly right, but some of the facial features were tough.  Either way, they had fun and didn't see it as anything negative.The light is a single bright LED, which is easy on batteries and provides a good amount of light through the paper.  They've also included a cardboard piece that fits onto the set which is supposed to reduce glare from the sun or room lights.  We didn't really have any problems seeing the outline in normal lighting.Another neat feature is that you can ""zoom"" the projection to 4 different levels in order to create larger or smaller people.  At the largest setting, a person fits nicely onto a 1/2 sheet of paper.Everything will fit inside the box, if you bend your sheets of paper around the lens, then place the cardboard glare shield in last.  There's enough room leftover to fit extra markers or pencils as well.The instructions also point out that to make extra sheets, you'll need to cut about 1/2"" off of a regular sheet of paper, then fold it in half and cut it.  The only other improvement I could think of is a way to clip the paper into place while tracing - maybe clips at the side, or a rubber band that could wrap around it.I wish they sold extra foils separately as the box/projector is pretty universal across all the different Ravensberger Xoomy toys.  If you can find some old transparencies, you could easily make your own designs and cut them to fit on the lens."
0,1,"Ravensburger, the famous puzzle makers, have now created a fashion creator set for girls. The set comes with a plastic case to keep all the pieces together, a small projector (which requires 4 AA batteries, not included), a tracing pen, paper, glare shield, 20 plastic template pieces (which are stored in a plastic slot in the case), and an instruction book.This is not the old fashioned toy where you mix and match plates, and then use a crayon to rub over the paper on the plates. This set has the child place a plastic circle template (called a ""foil"") on top of the projector light. The image can be expanded or shrunk using the lens on the projector, and then traced on to a piece of paper. A guide holds the paper in place. The one point of frustration for my child was that the plastic foils are tops, middles, and bottoms. There is no guide on where to start and end them, so it can be difficult for younger children to align the different pieces correctly. If the child has changed the zoom on the lens, that will also cause some frustration as it needs to be consistent to get a matching finished product.Once the complete design has been traced, the child can remove the paper and then color or decorate the model as desired. We purchased colored pencils, markers, and glitter glue for this fun part.While the toy is recommended for ages 8+, my 7 year old daughter had no problem using the toy.If you run out of paper, the instruction booklet has the dimensions on how to cut additional paper for use with the toy.This is a fun, higher-quality fashion designer toy for girls. It has the quality and durability that I would expect from Ravensburger."
1,0,"My daughter (8) loves this toy/game.  She loves to draw and color and really has enjoyed designing clothes with this toy.  Hours of entertainment.  She loves creating and coloring her creations.  At first she found it hard to line up the three sections, but it took no time for her to get the hang of it.  She has really enjoyed this product."
0,1,"My girls are 9 and 11 and, unlike me, are girly-girls who love anything to do with fashion.  They, like most girls their ages, like to draw.  I chose this item on a whim hoping it would be a nice, quiet activity that would travel well and personally, we're happy with it because they love it.  It's small (about the size of the average hardcover book) but not too small to use.  The batteries are AAA and it requires 4.  We've had this almost a month and it's been used A LOT and we've not had to change the batteries.It comes with some paper, a marker and the little plastic tracing disks.  But, being the creative family we are, we've just cut any paper to fit and used other things that are relatively transparent to trace.  What I like the most is that you can change the size of the item you are tracing by moving the lens closer or further away.  Any marker, pen, etc. will work, whatever you want to use to make interesting designs.  They've even used it (carefully) to trace a design onto old tshirt with sharpies and they turned out really cute.This is a fun item for people who can think outside the box.  I've even used it when I've wanted to enlarge my own artwork for tracing onto a canvas and it worked out OK."
0,1,"What you have for your kids is a small portable light table that offers creative enjoyment for a few days.  When the metric fitted paper runs out and you try to draw using the flimsy foils you find the frustration builds and the fun stops.  While you can mix up the foils for separate drawings the kids realize that its hard and frustrating to keep changing the foils.The fact that there is only a few sheets of lightweight paper and no colored pens really limits the creativity this item set out to handle.  Top it off with a complex way of adding in 4 AA batteries and you end up with a toy that sits on the shelf soon after the luster of newness wears off.  I suggest waiting for an updated version, that's a little more kid friendly."
1,0,"My 7 year old toy tester loved this one! She was able to create her own fashions with ease with the templates. It sure kept her quiet for awhile!

The previous reviewer(s) gave excellent descriptions of the toy, so I'll save my breath and just give you my pros and cons.PROS:~Easy puzzle pieces for early learners.~Catchy tunes that makes toddlers light up with glee.~Magnetics keep the pieces in place during transport.CONS:~Catchy tunes become annoying when you have them in your head constantly!~Cookie theme, I'd have preferred fruits and veggies, but they're not as fun.OVERALL:~I'd definitely recommend this toy as a good value, despite ""Some-one's in the kitchen making coooooookies, Some-one's making cookies todaaaaaay!"""
0,1,"I bought this toy for my son's 1st birthday.  He enjoys playing with it, but it wasn't as big of a hit as I was hoping for.  The good thing about it is that it teaches toddlers shapes, as they can place the different shaped cookies in the proper places.  My son has had fun playing with the different shapes, and what is nice is that it doesn't matter if they put the cookie upside down or not.  What seriously bugs me is the repetitive music and sounds of the toy.  Usually, the sounds that toys make doesn't really effect me much anymore, as I have become sort-of immune to most of them after having 3 young children.  For some reason, this toy does bug me quite a bit.  For that reason, I would even venture to give this 3 stars (if it were my toy).  Since it belongs to my son, and he does have some fun with it, I'm giving it 4 stars instead."
0,1,My youngest granddaughter.She is 2 and absolutely loves it! That is very favorite toy - of the moment that may change tomorrow but she has been playing with it everyday since Christmas. Also it's very sturdy no problems with rough handling.
0,1,"This a must have for toddlers. My two daughters both played with this a ton up to the age of 2.5-3 yrs old. This stops rotating when little fingers get jammed so never once an injury or even a tear. I really have no idea why this catches their attention so much but can vouch that it certainly did for my girls (up to aforementioned age). Buy this, you won't be disappointed."
1,0,These are such a huge hit with our 15 month old daughter.  This was by far her favorite Christmas gift.  It is just right for her age - so many of the things that she got are well beyond her capabilities.  She likes to dump the gears off and rearrange them on the pegs and stack them.  When she gets the gears where she wants them she presses the button for action and music.  It is very rewarding for her. We are practicing colors too. This is a hard age because they are beyond baby toys and not quite ready for 18 and 24 month toys. Thumbs up.
0,1,"I used this for my twins once they started sitting down on their own and they loved it.  I was skeptical at first thinking their baby fingers would get stuck but it's so gentle.  The lights and the music add to the spinning of the gears ...is a HUGE hit with them.  I even bought a second one.  Totally recommend for a one year old, for car travels, xmas gift, etc."
0,1,"This toy was in my mind for future purchase when my grandson was around one year old.  His brain seems to work like the gears and he enjoys deconstructing things.  I knew he'd love this.  He's had it now for almost a year and my daughter says he plays with it daily. At age 2, he enjoys switching out the gears to the other pegs."
0,1,"My 1 year daughter loves this toy! She had it since she was 8 months.  When she first got it, she would press the start button, and when the gears started going, she would get scared. Then after a while, she got used to it, and started dancing to the music. Then after a month or so, she learned how to take the gears off. Then after another month, she learned how to put the gears back on. Now she hides the gears everywhere. It's a toy that provides the child to play with it in various ways."
0,1,My 2-year-old got this for his birthday and he LOVES it. He loves to take gears off and stack them. This thing has kept him busy for quite a while! Highly recommend!
0,1,"The doll is very cute and fluffy. Not quite 14 inches, maybe if you stretch it from toe to hair top. The quality is lacking as hair falls right away but for the price what can you expect these days. Made in China, as expected. Too bad there is nothing between made in China and Made in Germany at hundreds of dollars each. Wish there were toys in between priced and higher quality than these."
0,1,"Well made and durable but not very ""cuddly"" and it was pricey.  Get it if you like but don't expect it to be your child's favorite."
0,1,"Great quality toy.  Very well made and the quality of the material is superb.  No educational value whatsoever but my daughter loves it and Ernie (with Bert, of course) has to go everywhere now."
1,0,my 1yr old loved it for months and carried it every where. She still pulls it out sometimes now at 2yrs old.
0,1,This Ernie Doll is the best i have ever seen. it is the perfect size for my 2 year old Son.
1,0,"Got this to go with my son's Schleich castle.  It looks great, and rolls fine.  My complaint is that you have to flip the weighted end to get your projectiles (not included) to fly.  I confess no knowledge of catapult mechanics, but it seems if this one was weighted a little better, it might make for more realistic battle action.That said, my son adores his castle, loves staging battles between armies, will save his sister's princess dolls from the dragon (and a Papo ogre), and it continues to inspire intensive, detailed, fantasy play.  The catapult makes a near-perfect addition to the Schleich World of Knights."
1,0,Gave it to my mom who is in a Nursing home for something different to do.  She has mild Alzheimer's  and this wasn't too difficult for her to do.
0,1,"I didn't.  I order coloring books galor from Dover and AMazon.  I was disappointed to see that these were really only 7 images duplicated.  If you know this up front, then you may truly enjoy the book.  [...]"
0,1,"All three of my grandsons, 7, 9 and 12 years old, enjoy playing with this set. They can build whatever they like, besides the intended design. The pieces are sturdy, and it's something other than Legos!"
0,1,"As a matter of fact, they were playing with them in the doll house this morning. These are very durable figurine toys, and are great for imaginative play. I love that Disney puts out high-quality toys. I am tired of wasting my money on junk and have started frequenting the Disney Store for our purchases. It is worth the money to have the toys last longer."
1,0,"We bought this our 2 year old daughter back in October. She has played with them EVERY. SINGLE. DAY since then. She carries them everywhere. Now, Jasmine did break off of her base. She's only secured by her two small feet. But this has not deterred her. My girl still loves these princesses with all of her heart."
0,1,"I did buy these from Amazon though the ""Amazon Verified Purchase"" tag is not here.  However, these are great!  The toys are very durable, well-made and just what I was looking for.  My 5 year old daughter is going through a ""princess"" phase and everything she wants is princess stuff.  I bought these to go with the Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Folding Princess Castle.  I tried them out myself before giving them to my daughter and they fit the castle perfectly and both go great together.  She is very pleased with them!I paid $[...] and no shipping costs.  Also, they are very well packaged but not hard to access."
0,1,"Just received this set.  As other reviewers have stated.......it came with only 15 pieces.  The bone, dog food and vitamins were missing from the set.  The product description clearly indicates that it is an 18 piece set including these items.  The package I received clearly states 15 piece set.  Disappointed, but my son doesn't know what I ordered so I guess only I will know the difference.  Seems like a cute set otherwise and he is happy with it.2/15/12 UPDATE:  I am very pleased with Amazon!  After submitting this review Amazon quickly offered a resolution to this even though I did not make a formal complaint.  I was very surprised.  My son still loves this set!"
1,0,My daughter got this for Christmas and is still lugging it everywhere with her.  She enjoys the accessories but mostly just the case and dog.
1,0,"Just received this kit and it is only 15 pieces.  No dog bowl, vitamin can, can of food, nor bone.  The bone and bowl were two of the reasons I chose this set over others.  It gives total care of the pet dog, not just the medical tools, which my son would like!  Will probably send it back now and look locally for a different set since this one doesn't have it all like it states and displays in the photo.  Disappointing!"
1,0,My 3 year old loves it on her swing set. It works really well and havent had any pinched fingers.
0,1,I bought these to replace old solid plastic ones that had seen better days... Love the fact they are form fitting and cling to my 4 year old fine without her slipping off of them. SHE LOVES THEM!! Great value for the money!!
0,1,I bought this as an extra swing.  I have no complaints about the product.  It is durable and serves it's purpose as a swing for a 3 yo.
1,0,"My 8-year-old nephew is obsessed with bugs, insects, spiders, etc.and he absolutely loved this scope.  I sent it all the way to Czech Republic for his Christmas gift, along with the book &#34;Big Book of Bugs&#34; and he was thrilled!  His only disappointment was that bugs aren't easy to find in the wintertime."
0,1,All kids love it.  All the kids that come over ride it at some point.  Our kids use it almost everyday.  Recommended.
1,0,my son and daughter play with this.  its a bit small for my 4 year old son but my 18 month old should be able to use it more now.
0,1,"These are super cute for a boy or girl, very whimsical and the colors are very entertaining to small children.  These are also a great buy because it's quite hard to find this sort of product that isn't made without all the bad chemicals, but these are BPA, phlalate free etc.  Used them over and over again (obviously squeezing out water in between use) but no mold or mildew buildup and the colors are as vibrant as they were when brand new."
1,0,"This is a very, soft and cute monkey.  I bought two as gifts and the kids love them.  I may buy more."
0,1,"This Ty monkey is very cute and soft. I bought a replacement for one that was lost several years ago. I think this is bigger than the one they made before, but it still looks cute."
0,1,"Whut?  He wasn't really using it...he just bought it as a ""mascot"" to keep in his car.  I asked him when he was going to give me the monkey, so he finally gave it to me for Mother's Day along with my card. ""Dangles"" is cute and soft, and I like him. So BOOYEAH!"
0,1,"I basically bought this in addition to an item that was 19.99 to get free shipping b/c I had a $25 gift card. I have had experience with TY Pluffies before so knew not to expect a beanie baby. These are better for smaller kids. I'm expecting a son and my husband's predicting of all the stuffed animals he's acquired while in utero, he thinks this will be our little boy's favorite. I worked at a women's and children's hospital and I know a lot of NICU babies rec'd pluffies as gifts to brighten up their rooms a bit. Mind you the age listed on the tag is older... but I think if you supervise your children as you should then there's no reason not to have one for a smaller kid (and never leave it in their crib with them.)"
1,0,"My 2 year old loves to help clean, so I bought him this broom set so he could &#34;help&#34; while I'm cleaning the house. Good purchase."
0,1,"Bought this for my 20 month old daughter who is constantly bugging me to let her sweep the kitchen floor. I was really impressed by the quality and price - the broom, dustpan & brush feel just like the real thing, not like toys at all. WAY better than the ones I was looking at in a major toy store retailer, and a couple of dollars cheaper too. Great purchase!"
0,1,This is a great idea for little kids who either want to help with chores or who need to learn how to help.  It's much easier to teach kids responsibility if you have the right tools.  This is the perfect size for toddlers or kids slightly older than that!
0,1,Two year old grandson loves to help his Mommy clean house and takes the big broom.  Hopefully he will like the small broom and develop good cleaning habits to last a lifetime!
0,1,"The brushes are real, I think my daughter even ended up with a better broom set than I have myself -_-"
0,1,"The kids love being able to help out around the house with this broom set.  It was so popular in my house that I had to buy a second one!  Beware when getting shipped though.  This was the only item I bought, and it was shipped in a box so big that I could have gotten in it and had the lid closed on me!  I know it's an awkward size, but the box they sent it in was ridiculous!"
0,1,I love this set and so do my kids. I bought it for my 1 1/2 year old son because he is always grabbing my broom and trying to clean and when he got this he just loved it and is always cleaning up and even my 7 yr old daughter was asking to clean. It's made very well and can be really used to help sweep up.
0,1,my son love to clear up a lot to i love this to i like this a lot my son going loveit to i my son are going like this
0,1,My two love to help me clean.  Now they can have their own size and not be hitting things around the house with my broom.
0,1,My daughter got this for her 5th birthday.  Both she and her 3 year old sister have been fighting over who gets to use it.  It is great because it seems to be the same quality broom as one you would buy to use to sweep yourself.
1,0,This is a very nice quality broom set and I am happy with my purchase for my 2 year old toddler
0,1,The brooms actually sweep very nicely!! Great quality and our daughter loves helping me clean with them!! I recommend this product if you have a little helper on your hands!!
1,0,"I read the reviews on this before I bought it.  They were right, they do stick to the wall of the tub.  All my grandchildren love to play with them during bathtime.What great fun!"
0,1,"Not only is this a great bath tub toy, but it is also a wonderful educational tool for the parents to use with their children."
0,1,This little mop was just what my 2 year old needed.  She loves to &#34;clean&#34; the house and this helps her do it.
1,0,"The child I purchased these for loved them, and played and played with them. I suggest buying them for all you people who know children that love knights and dragons. It replaces army men to an degree."
0,1,Oldest wanted to replace some of his toys that we had to throw and we got these.  He really liked them and still plays with them occasionally.
0,1,"Safari Ltd Knights and Dragon Toobthis can be a good toy if it didn't smell like a can of paint. the knights and the dragon is really cute, i just hope it really is LEAD free paint!!!!! other than that it's an ok toy...."
0,1,We have every O'ball made except one.  My 11 month old has loved playing with these since he has been able to grasp things.  He can easily pick it up and throw it.  He also loves chewing on it!
0,1,"I used to work in a toy store where we had these out to demo.  Sometimes I would spend half my shift pumping up balloons and letting the kids chase them all over the store.  So, I knew when my son hit a certain age that it was time to track down the Rocket Balloons.  It's a big hit.  I don't mind blowing them up several times while he chases them down.  Great way to burn off energy.  My child is under the age recommendation but he's well supervised and we enjoy this as a family game.  I definitely recommend this brand over others because you get more balloons!"
0,1,"I've given this as gifts to my child and many others.  Great fun for 4 yr olds and up!  My child can do sins herself.  You will get about 2.5 tries w each balloon before it pops, so be warned, but we have great fun inside on a rainy day with these.  Might drive house pets nuts, though."
0,1,I really like this tube because there is a lot of variety.  It's not just a handful of astronauts and a ship.  It had quite a few different pieces.
1,0,Our 3 month old grandson took to this toy immediately ...his father laid him on his back and put the toy on his right side....He moved his little hand found and grabbed it ....brought right to his mouth! Great infant toy!
0,1,I remember the old teething rings and was surprised to see the modern version.  The baby loves it and the design allows him to hold it without any trouble.  Thanks
0,1,This is a great 'ball' toy for our Grandson who is teething and has been since four months old.  He loves to chew on it and we don't worry about it coming apart.
1,0,"I bought this toy for a 3 month old for Christmas. After much inspection, I have come to the conclusion that this will be a very fun toy for the little one. Their little hands will be able to grasp every angle, and its also a teether. Its very flexible and very durable. The biggest plus for me is that it's ''different''.. not the usual same old same old teether toy. Very fun for the price."
0,1,"After 3 children, this is one of my favorite toys for infants (and one of their favorites too!).  The bright colors draw attention and the multiple rings make it easy to grab and hold to.  This is a must have toy and much better than any rattles."
0,1,This has made it threw 2 kids and still looks brand new! It has bright colors so it's fun and inviting. Great for teething babies.
1,0,"My niece seems to enjoy this toy at 3 months old. She can grip it anywhere and something is still in her mouth. Another reviewer mentioned it colored the water, so I placed mine in water and soap as soon as it arrived and the water didn't change color. Not sure if it was too new or if the material has changed. This is very soft and bendy!"
0,1,"This is an excellent toy for an infant. My 5 month old daughter loves it. Easy to hold, easy to chew, easy for momma to clean!"
0,1,"My two year old nephew loved this toy.  It was small enough for him to easily carry, but it was also chunky enough to be fun.  I loved that the toys could link magnetically.  Very cool."
1,0,I had this set as a child and loved it. I didn't even know they still made them. By chance I saw them here and thought what a great idea to have here for my 2 God children to play with when they come over.I was so excited when it arrived. Since it's a play at my house game I went ahead and opened it. Sadly the black board had had something spilled on it and white flicks of paint on it.The colorforms didn't stick to it or the white board very well at all. If you use one of them then replace it in the book it will not stick.I see others have had the same problem. I don't know if it is a bad lot or what but I also like another reviewer called the company and they are sending a new set to me. I so wanted to surprise them over the holidays.I'm going ahead with the high rating because I now this is a wonderful creative toy. It's not electronic or super hero stuff and that is what I love about it. It lets children and adults use your imagination.Not everyone has had this experience so maybe there was just a lot that got exposed to too much cold or heat or some odd thing. I am hopeful the replacement will be good. I must commend the company and I told them where I got it and they just said sure we will send you another one right away. Now that is a company that stands behind the product.I meant this to be 5 stars but it won't let me change it.I still recommend it I think this is a fluke only a few of us are having this trouble.UPDATE: The replacement came quickly and has no problems. Sticks well. Very Happy product just like I remembered. 5 stars.
0,1,"Only thing is I didn't remember how big it was. I intended to take it on a plane ride, but once it got here I see it's much too big for that to be reasonable.I should've checked the product information more thoroughly."
0,1,Used these animals for my jungle cake i made for my son.  The sizes were perfect for the cake and the animals were well done.
0,1,"I am a mother of a two year old and nothing makes me happier then to find my son toys that I played with when I was younger. And I thrive on finding good fun toys that don't involve batteries and have plenty of opportunity for him to use his imagination. They are small enough to fit into my toddlers hands and maybe even his mouth, but he doesn't put toys in his mouth often so I trust that they are safe for him without constant supervision... and I really don't see them being swallowed whole buy a small child anyway. They are made of durable plastic and the paint job has yet to be damaged and he plays with them every day. They even have names stamped on their bellies incase, like me, you can't tell the difference between a crocodile and alligator. I highly recommend these toys for any parent looking for something fun, durable and even educational... my son is finely trying to learn the names of animals because of these toys."
0,1,Smaller than I thought. The adult and baby animals are the same size with different features. My son loves them and has used them for hours of 'safari' pretend play. Would definitely recommend these because they are well constructed and have great detail. The animals are accurately presented.
1,0,"My son received this for his 12th birthday from a friend. Some other reviews commented on the difficulty of inserting the batteries ... I didn't have to deal with it as my son managed it without help. This game quickly became a favorite with my three boys, and with ALL the neighborhood kids! Can't tell you how many times all the friends would come play, having to wait, taking turns (as there are only so many pieces allowing kids to play). We bought a couple more when they went on sale to give as gifts. I'll admit after a bit the ball seemed to stop working as well and the kids lost interest, but when it was hot, it was THE toy to play with for all."
0,1,"I am 33 and am a total 80's freak. I think 80's and I think trends in music, movies, television, clothing, fads, toys & entertainment.I don't remember anything about politics or the news or newspaper headlines or what was going on in Bosnia at the time. I was a KID!This game is geared towards adults in the 80's. My parents will love it. They are in their 50's.The 3 questions I got right in the whole game had easy answers, too easy. Nothing fun.Oh, and the tv and movie questions are always asking who the actor/actress name is, not their character, who we all remember. I don't know Angela's mom's real name, from Whose The Boss, but it took a minute for me to remember her name on the show is Mona. THAT should have been the question. Not her real name. Who knows that??? probably my dad!"
1,0,"When I got this set, it's nice for me and my son to build the small castle to combine with our heroscape collection; however, we found out, one set isn't enough.  You will need more than 3 sets to create a huge castle for 1000 points army game (Well, we have 5 sets).  It's just like lego, you can combine all pieces to bulid up the castle and increase.  It looks awesome for us to set up scenarios such as orc vs human with castle attacking and defense.  We had fun with it.  The worse thing for this set is ""QUALITY"".  Some pieces aren't easy and smooth for you to combine together and split them out.  In addition, it will start to loose after using certain times."
0,1,"This gift was for my Grandmother, she's a huge fan of owls and she's collected them for years in pictures, little figures, even have a statue minding the garden, but she didn't have an owl like this so I bought her this toy, and she was very happy.  The bird is very well crafted comes in fatastic colors and even has a small tag that explains facts about the kind of owl it was meant to resemble, overall a darn good value.  Thanks for reading and have a nice day."
1,0,"My twin 2-year-old grandsons are very interested in owls. I wanted a stuffed toy owl that had BIG eyes and looked as realistic as possible. I bought 2 of these owls, one for each grandson. Although this owl is not squishy soft for a snuggle, it looks very realistic! The boys LOVE the eyes, which, face it...that's what makes an owl cool!! Sitting on a shelf in their room watching over them, the owls look wonderful. I let the boys play with the owls only when supervised because I want to put them up when they are finished so that the owls don't get stepped on, etc. Overall, I am happy with these owls...they LOOK great, even though they aren't really a snuggle owl....but I would rather have them look real. I use it as a chance to teach the boys to be gentle with ""animals"" and to take care of certain toys!!! It's all good!!!!"
1,0,"Do NOT buy this if you're expecting any type of quality of the item you see in the photo - BAIT AND SWITCH. This is NOT the toy in the photo, not by a long shot. We looked all over for the specific one that is actual plush and good quality, like the plush one would purchase in the department stores. This is cheaply made, like those carnival toys - BUYER BEWARE. Don't waste your money!My son was so disappointed, as was I. Amazon, your quality and trustworthiness has REALLY gone downhill since you started contracting to outside sellers. I am amazed at how many claims I've had to file since this has happened - and here is yet another one.I will say that amazon's customer service was good - if they do in fact process my refund and make good on the $10 credit toward my next order. But what I'd really rather see is a better screening process, and one that makes sure you're getting what you're paying for, because this is all a huge waste of my time and money  - and Amazon's, too, I am sure."
0,1,Purchased this item for my grandson's birthday to add to his collection.  He absolutely loves it.  It arrived quickly and is new.  He has enough plushes not to share with his sister for an enjoyable playtime.
0,1,This toy is great for three and up. Helps children learn balance and lets them burn off that extra energy kids have. We have had it for a year now and it have held up to rough/active play. A great buy!
0,1,I got this for my 3 year old so he could grow into it. the ones in stores are too small once a child hits 3 yrs
1,0,I bought this for my grandson as a gift. He has had the best time playing with it. It  is so cute
0,1,"One of the details I like best is that Folkmanis used different material for this puppet versus theFolkmanis Mini Porcupine Finger Puppet, so, even though my son has both, he could tell from day one which one was which.My main reason for buying him the hedgehog was because it made a great addition toThe Wonder Pets Save the Hedgehog! (Wonder Pets!).Even his Nana liked it; it reminded her of the ones in England."
0,1,"perfect addition to our sons thomas collection, he loves them and plays with them almost every day so far and loves the giggling car. :)"
0,1,"If your child enjoys playing with the Thomas & Friends wooden trains, the Troublesome Trucks are the rascals of the railway, featured in nearly every episode of Thomas & Friends.  (See previous review for a list of all the accidents the Troublesome Trucks have caused.) The Giggling Troublesome Trucks both have their own way of rickety rocking motion.  The Troublesome Truck with the red tarp rocks up and down, while the Troublesome Truck with ballast rocks side to side.  Also, when the red tarp is pushed, the trucks giggle.Overall, 5 stars.  The Giggling Troublesome Trucks are definitely a worthy addition to your child's Thomas Wooden Railway."
0,1,This is an okay addition to my grandson's train set but he doesn't play with it as much I had hoped.  It is cute and we will be glad to pass it on to another little boy.
0,1,"The My First Dollhouse Mom and Dad's Room is a great product for toddlers.  I have two daughters, 4 and 2, who play with this set almost everyday along with a couple of others I've recently purchased.  All the parts are large enough not to swallow, and are cast with quite thick plastic.  Additionally, the bed comes with an attached cloth blanket.  The bed is large enough for both the Dad and Mom action figures (sold separately). Also, the hutch has a reflective mirror and both drawers open and close.  I might add that several non amazon toy sellers are selling these things for over $14.00, which is quite a rip-off, considering the retail price for these.  I purchased this through amazon for about $8.00.  These may be out of circulation, so perhaps that explains the higher prices.  I definitely recommend them, so long as they don't cost a fortune."
0,1,These are some of the coolest action figures. My son loves the dragon. He is collection the whole set. They are really sturdy and well made.
0,1,"Bought two of these for my twin grandsons and they love it.  I don't know where they are, as they are hidden also."
0,1,This is nice small cash box that is easy for my Kindergartener to use.  In the past we have had problems with the kids breaking ceramic piggy banks or just popping the plug out of the bottom and playing with the money.  My son loves this cash box.  We have had it for a few months and it has held up to frequent use.  It is easy to use and can be locked using the combination (one number) and/or the keys.  Two keys are provided so we can keep one in a safe place in case my son loses his.  It is small enough for my son to hide it and feel that his allowance and tooth fairy money are secure.I will definitely order one for my other kids.
0,1,My 10 month old baby loves to play with these in the bath tub.
0,1,These are great toys for the bath.  My son has a few Alex toys.  He plays with them all the time.
1,0,"I bought these to top a cake I made for my son's birthday. They were perfect. The only issue I had is that the actual ship was tiny, smaller than some of the other pieces while in the picture it looks larger."
0,1,"my daughter loves to make her fake food but i just think it was overpriced. wish i would have bought a smaller batch of fake food, which would be just as fun and save a little bit of money"
1,0,"This entire Learning Resources line is amazing!  I hesitated buying this set at first because it was so expensive.  However, it is worth it!  The pieces are large, most of them being the size of the real thing.  They are not the cheap thin plastic that breaks and smashes easily.  They are durable, thick plastic that will definitely last.  I have purchased other play food sets and they just pale in comparison.  I also like that there aren't any labels or cardboard because those seem to get smashed easily and/or tear.  I absolutely love this whole set.  So much, in fact, that after I received these, I bought the sandwich set and healthy snacks set as well.  Highly recommend!!"
0,1,These are some of the better playfood sets out there. There isnt much in each set in my opinion. Its a little pricey but given the (cheap) alternatives with thin junky plastic these will pay for themselves over time. :)
0,1,"I purchased the Marky Sparky Blast Pad for my son on his 5 year birthday. He loves it! The only problem is that he loses rockets - the dog ate one, one landed on the roof, one stuck in a tree etc. You will definitely need a few more rockets just in case."
0,1,"My family and I just spent over an hour playing this new game. We had a great time! I used to love playing UNO as a kid, but it could get a little stale after a while, especially if only two people were playing. In UNO Spin, even two players can keep the game interesting and new.Even though the box doesn't really tout the game's educational value, this game has the potential to teach several things: strategizing, remembering other players cards as you're passing hands, and math when keeping score. We are homeschooling a 6-year-old so anything with ""hidden education"" is a bonus to us.The ONLY negative I have of this game is the packaging. It's just not well thought out. The package is great for marketing the game in the store, but it's not very easy to pack away at home.I completely recommend this game!"
0,1,"We were hesitant to get it for fear of our 5-yr-old getting 'hooked' on the game-playing, but he's enjoying it and doesn't over-do the playing time.  Worth the price, happy with the purchase.  We bought our own rechargeable batteries and recharger to avoid all the problems we read about the recharger on the reviews (cheaper too).  Additional leapster games are a little pricey (we're used to buying the cartridges for ""my first leappad""), so we haven't bought any yet and will hold off for a few months until he gets tired of playing with the ones that are built in to the leapster.  It does need some sort of carrying case, just not sure if I'll splurge the $13 or make our own."
1,0,"I am SO glad I got Leapsters for my kids! I got these as an Easter gift for my 3 1/2 & 5 1/2 year old.  Now they are 4 and 6 and the Leapster is still a favorite activity.  We use them pretty much exclusively in the car or when they will be waiting for a period of time (i.e. at his sister's dance class). I started out with regular batteries but just got the recharger, which is great (I don't worry about conserving battery life anymore, changing them is a pain). I have bought a few additional games, but they still like to play the ones that came with it. I could have gotten away without the new games for awhile I think.My 2 1/2 year old also loves the Leapster, so I think we'll be investing in a 3rd one for Christmas this year.  I was surprised that he was able to use it, but he does pretty well. I know he's not getting as much out of it as the older ones, but he can't bear not to have what they have. And he is able to navigate the simpler games and enjoys it whether he's learing or not.  That can't be a bad thing.They are very durable, having been dropped a number of times. Though I do recommend the carry case for a little extra protection.  I am thrilled to be able to let me kids play ""video games"" that are educational, and they love them so much.Except having 3 kids fighting over 2 Leapsters, there have been NO drawbacks to this toy/game."
0,1,This Leapster has been wonderful over the years. My son started using it when he was 3 and STILL plays it now that he's 8. It's been dropped and bumped so many times and keeps going.The system is excellent. Just read reviews for individual games before buying them. Most are really good but a few are boring.
1,0,Who was the Leapster bought for?  Well you can't tell in my house.  My husband plays with it as well as my 6 year old.  He claims he is testing it...But I know he loves it.  My daughter spends a lot of time on it and gets excited when she does really good.  We are already looking at buying more cartridges.  They are all so neat!!!  WAY TO GO LEAPFROG!!!!!
0,1,"We bought this for son's 6th birthday.  I thought he'd be too old for it, but he loves it!  He has four games: Kindergarten (available at Wal-Mart for $18), Outwit, Diego's Animal Rescue, and Animal Genius, all of which he picked up quickly and plays often.  I'd definitely recommend any of these games for 4-6 year olds.  So far, our Leapster has played fine--no problems with the screen or sound.  With regular play (1-2 hours a day), batteries last about a week."
0,1,"When my daughter was four, my husband brought her home a Leapster for Christmas.  It's the older, larger Leapster.  She absolutely LOVED it.  Then her younger brother kept borrowing, so we decided to buy him his own when HE turned four.  Hubby came home with the L-Max for him.  I have to be honest and say that we've never even once plugged it into the tv.  He doesn't know it has that feature and I'm not going to tell him.  Now the three year old is always borrowing a Leapster.  Since both of the older kids *still* play with theirs regularly, we'll be buying the three year old his own this Christmas.  My daughter has had hers almost 3 years and we've had no problems with it at all.  My son has had the L-Max for a year and we've had no problems with it either.  My children are NOT gentle with this toy.  They swing it around by the stylus, they drop it on the ground, they've even been known to hurl it across the room in a dramatic temper tantrum.  (I'm not proud of that but I'll be honest at least!)  Anyway, we think these are great products.  They are worth every single penny in my house.I like the fact that all the games we already own are interchangeable among all the machines so we don't have to buy the same age range of games for each new machine that comes out.  I would highly recommend this product as one for your child.  I am delighted that for once in my life, we spent money on a toy that could grow with our child that is actually growing with our children!  It's still a desireable toy even 3 years later.  AND it hasn't been discontinued early.  Unlike all the other Leapfrog products we've purchased, this one is a major winner!"
0,1,"This new version is not made like the older slightly larger verion. The materials are inferior and it cracks and scratches more easily. The components are not identical. I took the liberty of taking them apart to verify this. We have had 3 of these that the screen goes out, or it totally looses all power after one light drop or bang. My son's older original version has even been dropped out of a moving vehichle. It still functions well. If you expect a toy that is durable, made of good quality materials, and will last then I suggest finding the original one."
0,1,"My daughter got this for Christmas last year and plays with it often.  Both she and my middle child, who is 4, really enjoys the Kindergarten cartridge.  Unfortunately, their 2-year-old little brother gets ahold of it occastionally and so far has permanently damaged part of the screen and torn off the stylus (pen) used to write on the screen.  They still enjoy it, though.  The only down side is the expense.  The unit itself is costly, then all the cartridges are sold separately and aren't cheap either, then to keep from going through batteries like crazy, you'll want to get the charging station, also sold separately.  The carrying case is sold separately.... Something to consider if you're buying it as a gift for someone else's child.  The pressure will be on them then to buy all the rest of the stuff.  But for those who can afford it, it's a great learning toy.  Especially for traveling."
0,1,Durable and fun for little ones.
0,1,"I got mine for $6.00 and its a great buy, I wanted to get my kids one but they are 4 - 5 yrs old and I didn't know if they would like it. Man was I wrong. They love it. They even share with it and spend time playing with it and being quite. (this is a rare thing in our house) I got them some games for xmas but they love the free ones on it. Great buy and now I see why all my friends kid's love it. I may be buying another one after the holidays on amazon for one of their birthdays as they do love it. I also got my games one at target for 15.99 (on a reg non special sale day) and another online from the leapfrog site for 10.00. I might be getting one on amazon too later today. The cases how ever don't fit the item as I tried one in target but I have another one for their vtech vsmile hand held which amazing can hold both. Were going to be taking these on our 9 hr flight to NY this xmas. Great buy! I think its durable personally as its held up to my brute child quite well. FYI don't use rechargeable battery's or the pack you can buy as that is only for leapster2 but get the power cord which we got at target for 9.99. We also have one for our vsmile hand held and vsmile system.I had an issues with the stylist so I used the leapfrog site to find out how to fix it today.[...]Which tell's youQuestion: My Leapster is not responding correctly to the stylus pen.Answer: If your Leapster does not respond to the stylus pen, it needs to be calibrated.The following are instructions for calibrating the Leapster(tm) handheld.(1) Insert a cartridge, turn the unit on and wait for the sign-in screen to appear.(2) Hold down the Home, Hint and B buttons simultaneously.(3) When the screen changes, press the A button.(4) Using the Stylus, touch the center of the targets.If you have any issues go to their site [...]and look up your issue and select your product."
0,1,"My son loves Thomas and I must say that I love buying all the neat pieces to go with it.  I love going through all the bridges and stuff finding the ones ""they"" might like.  So when I saw this I knew he'd like it.  When we opened it up though and attempted to collapse the bridge, we realized that it took 2 hands to make it come down.  I had hoped that it would take one and he could be pushing the train as it collapsed.  Also, it takes quite a bit of pressure to make it collapse and the buttons and bottom supports are made of cheap plastic.  It hasn't yet, but I worry about it breaking.  Getting it to come back up from the collapsed position is also kind of difficult and then you have to make sure the tracks are aligned.The other complaint-it has 2 female ends.  It doesn't show that part in the picture but now you're stuck not being able to make the tracks that you want unless you have a bunch of their specialty pieces.  It doesn't show in the ""Items that were also bought with this"" the super expensive male/male and female/female pieces.The kids still like using it because it's a big bridge, but I probably wouldn't buy it for anyone else.EDITED: Thomas had been put away for a while and has since made a reappearance.  We haven't been using the train table (I recommend not buying one) so our track layout has been HUGE.  We made one and it used 4 loops, the original figure  8 bridge, the coal bridge and this collapsing bridge.  Since we've never had the chance to loop under this bridge (space constraints of the table, I never noticed we WEREN'T ABLE TO HAVE TRAINS GO UNDER THE BRIDGE!  What?  What good is a bridge if you can't have more track go under it?  We propped it up the 1/4"" with some cardboard pieces but that's not the point.  I feel this was more than a let down, if the kids didn't like this, I'd have change the rating from 3 stars to 1 instead of just 2 stars.  Quality control is less than lacking in this.  For the money it is a huge disappointment."
1,0,I have ordered many 'Thomas' products from Amazon and never had a problem. This bridge was no exception. My son is very happy with it.
0,1,"I got this for my 6 year old son for Christmas.  He loves it.  Easy to follow instructions.  Safe experiments with simple enough beginning science concepts to keep his attention, learn some basics and still have fun.  Great kit!"
0,1,"My 7 year daughter was so excited until she did about 5 of the experiments. Not exciting. The funnest part was using the dropper and measuring spoon to measure the ingredients but on the instructions it says things like after adding the ingredients, now you have 2 cups of purple water. Get ready to blow your mind. Add one medium scoop of baking soda to one of the cups and stir it in. It changed color!  I just wasn't that impressed and neither was my daughter, I would go with a different kind next time."
0,1,"My daughter's 5 year old friend asked for this gift and from what he's told me, he loves it.  He's had a great time with the experiments and his mom told me it's kept him very busy.  Hope that helps a little."
1,0,"I only ordered this as my search criteria in Amazon showed that it was ""made in the USA"" and it is not.  I will be returning it."
0,1,"I gave this to my 11 yr. old nephew for Christmas. The next morning, my sister woke up to the house smelling like a giant sewer and had gook to clean up all over the floor, walls and counter. Paybacks are the best!!! BTW, my nephew had a blast!"
0,1,"I have an 8 and 9 year old that love science and chemistry, so this really hit the spot because the love all the girly stuff too!They make their own scents and now, over 4 months later are looking for more perfume chemicals to mix and make more lovely smells."
0,1,"Actually I did not understood what exactly I was ordering because I am Russian and the word &#34;slime&#34; was unfamiliar for me. I looked up in dictionary but there were various meanings. But I have bought four or five science kits from this manufacturer before so I risked. And we spend interesting time with this kit - me and my 5 years old son. I just wish they put a bit more that ingredient which makes the slime glowing (zinc, I guess). Not all the experiments worked as they were supposed to do ( and this is the case with almost every science kit for kids) but overall this kit is not a bad choice."
0,1,"This game is like a modified game of chess...with lasers!  You press the Sphinx head to shoot out a red beam to try and take out your opponents Pharoah, but be careful, you might accidentally take out one of your own pieces -or your own Pharoah!  As a side benefit, children can learn about light bending with  mirrors!  My children enjoy it but the adults are enjoying it as well!  Clearly, it is the type of game that as you play, you get better because you start to understand which way the light is going to bend."
1,0,Super fun game. The lasers help with spatial awareness and strategy. We enjoy this more than most board games and will spend a lot of time enjoying this game.
0,1,"A bit over prices for what you get, but its a nice set and very fun with animals and zoo keeper."
0,1,"We purchased for our great grandson Keagen..he loves Duplos..when we go to visit, he takes his Poppa by the hand and says lets go to my room to play.  He always builds something from all his Legos that we purchased via Amazon.  His favorite toys ever."
1,0,"This is a great starter set of Duplo animals. It comes with four nicely sized animals - giraffe, polar bear, elephant, and lion cub plus a female zookeeper. It has a grass piece, two flowers, five square pieces, and five long pieces, including a long clear blue piece. Minus the two flower pieces, all the pieces are large enough not to be choke hazards.Our 14 month old picked this set out himself at the Lego store and loves it. He makes noises with the animals and is learning their names. We paid $9.99 as of January 2013, and for the number and types of pieces, this set is a great buy at that price.:: posted by Rob's wife"
0,1,had already bought the Zoo playset and thought these animals would be smaller than the ones from that set...but they were duplicates...at least they don't fight over them now!
0,1,Bought to use with our Melissa & Doug Train track set and it works great.  You can actually build two separate tunnels with it.  Great piece.
0,1,"Gave this to my son for his 2nd bday with a bunch of other amazon ""off"" brand wooden train set track and other bridges and tunnels. For the cost of a small name brand set, I was able to put together a really nice big set!! All the Thomas trains work great on it and in it. Works great with different track brands too. My two yo can set it up and move it around without any help. He has also set up some of his bridges to go over it instead of the curved track, so it's versatile too. He's already had hours of fun with it!!"
0,1,I have bought this a few times as birthday gifts for girls ages 6-8 and each one really enjoyed it.  I bought my daughter one because all of her friends had one and she thought it was fun.
0,1,We bought this gift for our little niece who's becoming a creative little girl.  This product provided her a creative way to make some neat little arts and crafts with her mom and dad.It's an inexpensive little set that provides her and her parents a fun way to interact together and make some fun projects.
0,1,"Very fun playing cards.  The depictions of the dogs are very stialized, often having the nose be closer than the rest of the dog, making the heads look huge.  Nice feel to the cards though."
0,1,"This bedroom set is absolutely adorable! The white beds make it look like a children's room and this is perfect if you intend to put 2 children in one room, because you can put the bookshelf in the middle of the beds. The posters make the room look so cute and lifelike! The books it comes with can be put in a critter's hand and a pencil in the other hand to make it look like they're doing homework:) Such a great buy if you have a dollhouse!"
0,1,"A fun game!  The directions are easy to follow and my grandchildren learned to play it quite easily, even the youngest.  It's not our favorite card game but still one they come back to from time to time."
0,1,"All of the reviews I read said how great it was and the magnetic darts stuck to the board so well.  Well, I can honestly say, that all of the reviews were correct.  I gave this to my grandsons on Christmas Eve and even the parents were playing with it and commented on how well the darts would stick to the board.  I know they will get lots of use out of this dart board."
1,0,"My 4 year old picked this as a gift for her dad. The board is very light, so its easy to move around. The darts stick perfectly, we haven't had any problems with them bouncing off. Much better than the suction cup style dart boards. Both my kids (10 and 4) like playing with it."
0,1,"got this for the nephews, but was a hit with all the adults in the house!  the darts really stick well.  you can feel the pull of the magnet.  we brought extra darts (pack of 6 refills sold on amazon) to cover any we may lose or if we have add'l folks playing.  great product.  glad i purchased."
1,0,This is kind of like Longest Road in Catan.  It doesn't really change gameplay that much.  If you are looking for a great mini expansion I recommend The Phantom
0,1,"My kid loves the animals, but alongside with our brio trains they are incredibly flimsy. Also, there are 3 animals but only 2 slots for them to ride."
0,1,This is a good product but the pictures on Amazon make the product look larger than it actually is. Overall its a good buy
0,1,its compatible with our other little trains.  Our son loves to take his animals for rides and is especially happy with the caboose (he uses it on every train set he makes)
0,1,My five-year-old needs help with this one but he enjoys it and the picture is fun. I really love the Melissa and Doug floor puzzles and find the quality to be excellent for the price.
0,1,Fun game. Fast moving and easy to catch on to. Ages kindergarten to middle schoolers loved this game the container is a big plus!
1,0,"We got this bucket of animals for our 3 year old for Christmas. He loves it and plays with them almost daily. The animals are decent size, between 2 and 3 inches respectively. He is really into animals, and loves to watch the Wild Kratts kids show. This bucket of wild animals was the perfect accompaniment to a Wild Kratts DVD set."
0,1,"I bought this set for my brother's kids (8, 6, 4, and 2). They have aKidkraft Deluxe Let's Cook Kitchen. I also bought them theLearning Resources Kitchen Set(I wouldn't recommend that, by the way.)This food set is great! I was hesitant to buy it since it seems pretty expensive, but the kids really liked it. The food is realistic and attractive, and there is such a variety! My 6-year-old nephew liked that there is a list of all the items on the side of the box. If he wasn't sure what a food was, he would look at the list and go, ""Oh, I think this is the ______."" They also used that list as a kind of ""menu"" to let customers choose what they wanted as they played restaurant.The storage box that comes along with it is high quality and the food fits back in easily. I would recommend using somewhat large plates when playing with this food, since some of it is pretty big. The colors are great and everything seems to be good-sized. We did not notice any kind of ""chemical"" smell or anything out of the ordinary when playing with the food. I highly recommend it!"
0,1,"We received the Learning Resources Giant Play Food Set, set of 80 FROM learningresources.com. We had a few coupons, but it is going for $130+ on their site (plus tax and shipping if you don't have coups!). We are thankful for the coupons otherwise this product would have got sent back. Although it has some pretty awesome pieces, I was impressed and also disappointed in some of the detail in some pieces.Out of the 80 pieces this has, I would of liked to of seen more smaller pieces to ""cook"" rather than a large head of lettece, apple, orange, potato, carrot etc. He has the Melissa and Doug set, so we were looking forward to the pieces like the chips, sandwich pieces, bread etc. My husband loved that this set had food from other regions! I had to ask my husband what was what on a few of the pieces b/c TO ME the detail was lacking. But that just gives your child the opportunity to use their imagination more. (:Paying $130+ for this set is WAYYYYYYYY too much!! I personally would pay $80 or below for it. Right now the sale price on this is $100, for this listing, and even that is iffy. The fact this is the best, most durable set, I could find... the $100 might be a good buy for others. It's all personal opinion and what your'e looking for in a food set for your child."
0,1,"I bought this to accompany the kitchen set I bought for my 2yr old.  After seeing the dissapointing selection of play food available in stores I was ecstatic to find this set.  The food is life size and is comparable to the play food used in children's museums.  It's made of thick rubbery plastic look realistic. It is very durable.  I can imagine it lasting for many future generations of children in our family. It also comes with some cool food items like tacos, asparagus, and sushi that are not seen in other sets.Another plus is the absence of the crappy canned food and the minimal amount of junk food (just two slices of pizza, not 10).  Of course there is some cake and ice cream cones (you gotta have the cake!) but there is also a lot of vegetables and fruit.  The sandwich stuff is pretty cool too.  There are slices of bread, lunch meat and cheese to construct your own sandwich.Bottom line, this is a top quality food set that will stand up to many years of play."
0,1,"The Lion itself looks hammered...the fur is regular plush, but the mane is really stringy looking.  It doesn't matter to my kids as they adore all webkinz, and do their chores very quick so they have time to get online and feed their pets, water their gardens etc.  But I think this one is just not as cute as the others."
0,1,"Let me just say that although it appears that the pros and cons in this review even each other out, the joy of seeing my girls play with the unit would make me buy it all over again--they play with it more than any other toy they own (and believe me, they have just about everything--our friends say this house looks like a toy store).Pros:-Lots of cabinet doors and other doo-dads for little ones to play with.-Pretty durable given the quality of plastic (my 35 lb., 2-year old daughter periodically sits in the feeding chair and it hasn't fallen apart yet)-Good colors for girly-girls-Lots of places to stick baby dolls (one in the crib, one in the sink, one on the changing table, and two in the cabinet)-sink parts and mobile are pretty realistic and give the kids something to do while the babies are sleeping or bathingCons:-Pain in the you-know-what to put together--took me 3 hours the night before Christmas: 45 minutes to detach and smooth out all ten thousand pieces from the ""plastic tree"" (hint: use scissors and a metal nail file to smooth out the connective tags on the pieces)and another 2.25 hours to put everything together... Order it well before you need it!-Sink sprayer isn't attached to the unit and is MIA. Minor inconvenience, but worth mentioning. When we find it, I'll tape a short cord to the sprayer so it doesn't disappear again.-The unattached ""music"" monitor thingie is very staticky and scared the heck out of both of my girls and our two dogs. That, too, is now MIA.Again, I would like to emphasize that for the price, you're not going to beat all of the features on this unit. And yes, it's just plastic... but I figure that if/when it breaks I won't be as upset as I would be if I'd spent twice as much on a comparable unit."
0,1,"Cute train, easy for our little one to remember the name of the train. A great addition to the set, battery operated for fun."
1,0,"these battery-powered engines perform pretty well on the flat.  They can pull up little hills too, but they sometimes need a little help."
0,1,--Initial Review--We added this to our Thomas the Train set that was passed down to us.  It was our first battery powered train.  Our 2 year old son loves it.  Batteries went out within a couple of days but that is because he played with it 24/7.  Now batteries last a lot longer since he plays with a few others toys during the day now.--2 months after purchase--This model broke on within the first two months.  This train is made by Learning Curve who is no longer in business.  Fisher Price now owns these trains and who sells them.  I recommend buying the Fisher Price model because if it does happen to break they will replace no questions asked.
0,1,What a great toy.  My 8.5 month old daughter has been playing with this for 15 minutes.  She can make it go by herself already :)  She has a great time chasing it down the hallway.  I love that it doesn't need batteries or make obnoxious noises.  It even works on the carpet!
0,1,"This toy is great!  It's a lot of fun and my absolute favorite part: NO Batteries!!!  Which means I not only can save a ton of money not having to buy batteries, I also can submerse it in water to clean it which saves from the hassle of wiping down electronic toys.  This toy goes super fast and a long distance.  It is MY favorite of all the hundreds of toys at our house and although my 17 month old isn't as thrilled about it as I had hoped... I think the older she gets the more fun it will be for her.  I would recommend this toy for sure."
1,0,"I just purchased this for my daughter's first birthday. I love that it doesn't have batteries and is easy to operate (by pushing down on the worm's back). My 5 year old enjoys pushing it to my 1 year old, it runs into her and they both laugh, and I help her send it back. I would recommend this toy."
1,0,just got this yesterday and opened it to show my baby girl. she was amazed by it..watches it zoom past her. haha. she is 8 months old and so far only could grab it and throw it around. haven't learnt how to press it down to make it zoom yet though...i think she will probably have fun with it in the near future.
1,0,"I like this toy and am glad I bought it, but this has only 8 buckets and not 10 like the description says.  I'm confused because some reviewers also talk about their being 10.  They are colorful, sturdy, and lots of fun for my kids though, and the shapes have great raised animal faces on them.  All in all, I'm glad I purchased, but the toy lost 1 star because of the incorrect and misleading description on Amazon."
0,1,"I bought these for my 14mo old girls and they love them. The shape sorter and bucket are the first toy they go for and can spend an entire bath playing with it. They are learning to pour water from one cup to the other and have a great time.Some of the cups have drainage holes and so do the shape blocks.The toys are made well with hard sturdy plastic. These things are going to last a long time.The blocks are hollow but a good hard plastic. They are a good size. Fits their whole hand.The shaper sorter bucket top snaps on so the girls can't open it themselves. Sometimes I just leave it off the bucket and they play with the blocks and just the top.The bucket handle is a 'break away' ....almost too easy....so no strangulation concern there.Overall, I really like these toys and so do my girls. I would definitely recommend to a friend or buy as a gift."
1,0,"We got these because my son's preschool teacher recommended them, but then someone else bought him Magformers, which are waaay better. These tend to fall apart more easily and the big problem with them is hard to explain, but here goes: they are straight-edged with 90-degree corners, which (with the tendency to fall apart) makes it difficult to build more complex shapes, like regular polyhedrons. The other day, my son and I made a regular icosohedron out of magformers and it even withstood a little tossing around, and that would never happen with these. Because of the shape, they fit together best at right angles to each other. I would skip these and get magformers instead."
0,1,"My kids are 3 and 5, and Magna-Tiles are by far their favorite toy.  They make towers, homes, roads, elevators, etc.  There is nothing better than a toy that lets you use your imagination and creativity.  My daughter ended up getting rid of her dollhouse, and making her own homes with the tiles instead.  This is a fantastic toy, and worth the investment!"
0,1,"after the last year when they were overpriced due to the flood they had it's been a long wait. ha. now that we have them they are SO MUCH FUN! we have these at the museum but my son is always preoccupied with something else, (he's still young). i knew if he could have them by himself he would play with them. sure enough not even an hour after opening (birthday gift) he built a huge rocket ship with it. extremely well made and beautiful! i also recommend buying more than one set, (we bought two). the options are limitless! i even caught my husband building away after bedtime."
0,1,The best toy! My kids play with them for hours. Both my 5 year old girl and 3 year old boy love them.
0,1,"We purchased the translucent 100 piece set nearly a year go. It is by far one of the best investments we've ever made. Everyone who comes to our house (including the adults) fall in love with this toy. We have all (ages 2-30) enjoyed this building set. We will be buying another 100 piece set soon because they are just that great. You will not regret this purchase. It is in the top five of the best toys we've ever purchased including: Wedgits, Lego's, Play Silks and Snap Circuits. Everything else tends to fade in and out of favor but these all get constant use."
0,1,"When I first heard about these blocks, I thought those things are expensive.  But my son had played with them at daycare and enjoyed them so much that we requested a small set for Christmas.  That is all he played with, but there was not enough in the small set for two kids to play together.  So he got the larger set for his birthday (this 100 piece).  As most parents, we have bought toys in the past that get played with for one or two weeks then they find their way to the bottom of the toybox.  These tiles are a favorite.  They are brought out several times a week and are always at the top of the toybox."
0,1,"this item was recommended to me as i was waiting for a doctor's appointment. i needed a birthday gift for a two-year-old. a young woman raved about this item and so i went onto my go-to website, amazon.com and checked it out.  although it says for three years old and up, the pieces are big enough not to have to worry about my grandson swallowing them.  at $120 for the &#34;value pack&#34; of 100 pieces, it's a hefty price, but...all the kids from two years to seven years do not stop playing with them.  my four years old studies some pictures and then duplicates them to a tee. the girls build castles and they all build other things as well.  thanks to the young woman who said to buy this. oh, there are also enough pieces so that more than one child can build at the same time."
0,1,"yeah these are pricey (pay about 120$ by the way as some places jack it up even higher), but they are so worth it! I buy these as gifts for friends and family.- 100 pieces is a good starter set, you may actually want 2-3 sets if you have 2+ kids as they can get really creative with more- clear ones i prefer over the solid ones- strong plastic that is very durable. my kids have thrown them, stepped on them, jumped on them... barely a tiny crack on 1 and most are going strong after 2+ years- magnets are a decent strength. not too strong but enough to build a tower 5 feet high. could probably be higher if my son didn't destroy it early. i hear the knockoffs don't have as good magnets. that is important as it can affect how high you can build your models.- good variety of shapes to stimulate their imagination. just let them explore or play guide them. either way they will come up with new things on their own. mine were building a house/zoo for the toy dinosaurs the other day.- super easy cleanup. it is actually fun for the kids and I to clean up as they snap together well and neatly.All in all, one of the best toy purchases i've ever made (even at such a pricey starting point). it continues to entertain them 2 years later and is super durable. I highly recommend if you can afford it."
0,1,"We have two sets of a hundred clear magna-tiles, and will undoubtedly buy more.  Kids from 4 through 10 can play together in groups big or small, or play alone... At any age, kids can find ways to build structures and have intricate fun.  You can't go wrong with these.  Too bad they're so expensive, but they're indestructible.  Save 'em for your grandkids."
0,1,"This is a great bundle for the cost, however the paint brushes come apart easy however we are going to try to super glue it back on."
0,1,"I like this set for our school easel. The tops are not hinged, so they pop off and must be stored away while the paint cups are in use. I actually just set the cups on top of the lids. They are easy to open for children, and include all of the paint brushes. This is an excellent set and very well priced. I would buy it again!"
0,1,"Our kids love bath time and we switch up bath toys for them every night. Since we got this however this has  become the bath toy of choice and they have not played with anything else so far. Our 3 year old helps mommy or Daddy give lil sister a bath and he likes to pour water in and show her how it works. She is 18 months old and picked up on how to do it right away! When it is his turn in the tub, he loves to play with this funnel water wheel. He likes to hold it under the running water while the tub fills up! Might consider getting another one for the sandbox towards summer time!"
0,1,"I love this Seirnna. She has an awsome outfit. I love this look teh Sweet Dreamz collectiobn has, very wild, lots of colors and lpolka dots and stripes. Very nice. I hope to get this doll soon, it's cool Katia wears it in the Genie Magic movie too, looks good on her. I hope to see moe Siernna's soon, like this one, the best Siernna yet, out of two, but you know what I mean. Bratz and Danny Phantom ROCK!!!"
1,0,We didn't really like this wand. Doesn't look very great or work very well. But my daughters friend was happy to acquire it. We just gave it away because we didn't like it too much. But then it's a very basic wand for a very cheap price. And that's what you get in return.
0,1,We've had this toy for almost a year now and even with much use it is still going strong! Worth it!
0,1,"Great durable, as described.  My son loves to water the plants with me.  He also uses it to play in the pool. Good size, and durable.  Not cheap, sturdy."
0,1,"Fisher Price has always had wonderful toys, I myself had a few growing up, and when I purchased this for my 3 year old daughter, I just KNEW she'd love it. And the bus is a great bulky size, and the people are wonderfully crafted and bulky, as well."
0,1,"This is one of my toddler's favorite toys. She loves driving it around to pick up her little people or other small toys that she has. It has two doors, a sign that you can pull out, and a button on the driver's chair that makes noise (horn honking, driver saying two different things, and a cute song). This is a toy that encourages kids to use their imaginations. Bright, colorful and fun!"
0,1,"Not up to the quality of the Fisher Price Little people of my generation. I don't like the fact that there are three spots for 'kids' to sit on the bus, but it only comes with 2 kids. Come on!!!"
0,1,"Seems like every child learns &#34;the wheels on the bus go round and round.&#34;...so this bus is a super hit with our 18 mo - 2 1/2 year old genius grand children.  If you push a figure on the driver's seat, it makes a sound.  But, frankly, they just like to open and shut the doors and then run it back and forth and back and forth over and over.  Sturdy, simple...I like it too.  (Now, back to, &#34;the wheels on the bus go round and round...&#34;"
1,0,"My child loves the real school bus he rides on to preschool, every time he hears a loud truck he runs to the window to see if it's a school bus! So I wanted to get him one to play with at home. This is perfect. He lines all the people up, walks them onto the bus then drives it around randomly pressing on the driver to make the lights and sounds. He just loves it. The wheelchair is a doesn't really look like a wheel chair and I don't think he knows what it's supposed to be right now, but it's a nice idea for it to be included. If you have other little people from other Fisher-Price products they will fit on the bus too."
0,1,this is a good learning toy and is sure to please any litte child.  I have been pleased with most of the fisher price toys I have pruchased in the past.
0,1,"My 2yr old love playing this school bus. He dont like to play the music but he just love playing with it, putting little people in and out in the bus. So cute!"
0,1,"My boys loved this toy when they were younger! We had two of them, and got a lot of play out of them. We loved to pull the figures in and out of the bus, and make it talk and watch the lights flash. The figures are very durable and can be played with safely outside of the bus. I love that they included a wheelchair in there, great first teaching tool for small children. I do agree with another review on here, the doors do fall off a lot, but they pop back on easily. A great, classic toy from Fisher Price, yes i'd recommend this one!!"
0,1,"We gave this to our 2 year old grandson for Christmas, along with Noah's Ark.  His sister rides the school bus, so he loves it & can't put it down."
0,1,my 2 year old loved this toy when we got it and a year later he still plays with it!no problems with it whatsoever. Terrific toy!
0,1,we tied a string to the front and the kid loves to drag the bus around and take her little people to &#34;school&#34;
1,0,"We own pink version.I can't say enough good things about this little computer!  I'm gonna be very honest...  it took me a while to buy it because (and I hate to say it now) but I just thought the thing looked cheesy (cheap)...  But man was I wrong!  We've had it a while now and my daughter still plays with it for extended periods.  It really is a GREAT toy!  It is very educational and helps with hand eye coordination -via its mouse training applications.  I only regret having waited so long to buy it -recommend for kids 3 and 4.Other great features are: it's incredibly durable, you can switch mouse for use on either side and it has an automatic shutoff after about 3 minutes.Only bad things about it are: it is loud even on lowest setting (as many reviewers have mentioned) and the screen is small (but I dare say there isn't one out there with a bigger screen for this price :-).Seriously, if your child is 3 to 4 you won't regret buying it.** And I also need to set AEH ""Mom of Toddler"" straight; the child does NOT need to know how to read in order to enjoy the computer.  Child can scroll through and pick which application he/she wants to play with the monkey as his/her guide. **"
0,1,"Got this for my 2 year old son when I got my own laptop, in hopes it would occupy him with his own and off of mine! It does that. Briefly. He's an active kid and doesn't sit and play with this kind of thing very long, okay, but this doesn't occupy him very long. I'll get my laptop out and he'll run off and get this, sit down, put it on his lap, mess around with the buttons and the mouse for a while, and then he's off to something else (or MY laptop) after about 5-10 minutes max. He's certainly as bright as some of the other reviewers' 2 year olds, but he most certainly didn't pick up the alphabet in some days/weeks and start playing with this thing ""correctly."" This is NOT a stupid or slow kid, and things like figuring out how to choose exactly which activity he wants and playing it correctly every time are absolutely beyond him. I suspect that anyone with a 2ish year old that did that is absolutely the exception, not the rule.If you're looking for this for your 2(ish) year old to keep them occupied,  you might want to look for something else. If you have a really calm toddler, you can probably use this WITH them to help teach the alphabet etc - it seems to be a good learning tool. But don't expect most kids that age to sit there and figure it out alone and learn that way. Not gonna happen. They're too young.  If you want something that they can bang away on pretending to be typing like Mommy on her laptop and pretending to be using a mouse like Mommy does, it's great. (That's why I got it for mine.) But even then, it's limited in its ability to ""entertain"" them - at least at this age.I have 2 big complaints with this product. The first is what other reviewers have mentioned: The sound level defaults to medium (should default to low!!), but worse than that, when the sound level button is pressed, the really, REALLY annoying monkey on the screen starts screeching (my husband says it sounds like a super loud annoying cricket) and does not STOP until a different key is pressed. Even if the cover is closed. Wanna guess what button my little boy likes to press the most?  And then walk away.  Arrgh!Second, I realize he's slightly below the minimum age for this, but still. The battery compartment on the back has NO screws holding it closed. It simply snaps shut. He delights in turning it over, opening it, and yanking out the batteries - faster than I can leap up and get him to stop. This is simply DANGEROUS. Unless the toy is for 5+, they ought to be securing those compartments shut. I don't get it.All in all, I think it's a good learning tool, and with a fairly calm kid or a slightly older kid, I think they'd learn a good deal from this and have fun doing it. But if you're reading this because you're thinking of buying this for a 2 year old or thereabouts, and hoping they're going to learn all this stuff all by themselves just by playing the game, I don't think it's likely.  And if you have an active (""busy"") toddler, don't expect this is going to hold their attention for all that long."
1,0,"Bought this for my 3 1/2 year-old son for Christmas. My kids always get to open one present on Christmas Eve, and since a marshmallow gun is what he specifically asked for this year, we let him open it. Straight out of the box, it did not hold air pressure. My (very handy) boyfriend was able to fix the issue more or less, but unless they're the perfect size and shape, the large marshmallows get stuck in the barrel. I even took the advice of some other reviewers and let the marshmallows sit out so they weren't so squishy, and we also refrigerated some as well. We were all very disappointed with this toy, and it's getting returned. Guess we'll just stick to Nerf guns from now on."
0,1,"My boys still play with these shooters and have a blast.  My complaint is that the gun only holds two marshmallows at a time and  if the marshmallow isn't completely firm, it will get stuck.  Avoid using the same marshmallow more than once.  I started putting the marshmallows in the fridge before they play.  That seems to help a little."
0,1,"We had no problems with the marshmallows jamming and all the kids had a great time with this.  I even got one for my husband.  If you pump the blaster good, you can propel the marshmallows pretty far and relatively hard (does't really hurt when it hits you, but it surprises you!).  I would recommend for some really harmless family fun."
0,1,"Ordered a couple to have around with other gadgets (water pistols, etc...) for use at a summer birthday party in our back yard. Once we got the regular size marshmallows it worked great, and the kids were able to get the marshmallows to shoot a decent distance. Would buy a pair again for the same use - silly fun and laughs."
1,0,"Picked this game up for my daughter at a garage sale for $1. She's 2 and LOVES it. However, there is no real off switch of than yanking out the batteries. This thing will just keep in quacking, even if you push the off button. Despite that, she really likes it, and as soon as your kid knows the colors red, yellow, green and blue, this game is right.I gave it a 4 because it really needs to have a better on and off switch so that i don't have to take out the batteries each time, so that it won't start quacking on the shelf and wake my daughter up from a nap."
0,1,Super cute and decent quality for the price.  thank you oriental trading company.  Used this for a birthday party- in a pi&ntilde;ata.
0,1,My daughter loves ducks so I thought id get them for a birthday party favor. They are cute but smaller than I expected. They were a good price though
0,1,"Super cute little Maracas that my daughter loves. I got the lady bugs and they have held up well to toddler abuse and regular play. Cute, durable, and entertaining - who could ask for more?"
0,1,My daughter and I loved the look but these are are made of such soft wood that they got badly dented withing 5 minutes of play.
0,1,"My baby got introduced to these at a gymboree class. She loved them so much that I decided to buy her some of her own. I was so excited to find them on Amazon. I got them really quick and they are in excellent condition. They're very easy to blow up, and my baby loves them."
0,1,what fun we had at the beach with these fun mini beach balls! they were cute and tiny and plenty to share with anyone who was there!
0,1,I bought these for my 13 months old baby to have something to play with in our pool. I like the different patterns and the size is perfect for little hands.
0,1,The pieces are all easy for little hands to grasp.  They are chunky and durable.  They are actually more like blocks than puzzle pieces.  I would definitely recommend this and others in the line.
1,0,"This is actually my son's review.  Set up was easy.  We took it out of the box, glanced through the directions and off he went.Pros:  It went on water and land which is a major bonus for my son.  Just ""plain cool"". He got to about 20 feet and the signal strength dropped.  It is important to note that there are a couple of requirements to use it as a water toy.  The water must be still and no waves or wind is recommended. It was lighter than most remote control toys.  The toy was able to negotiate a small obstacle course. The wheels were big enough to go over two hardcover books with no problem.Cons:  The controls were odd and ""wonky"".  You didn't get any speed out of it because for the first ten minutes you are trying to adjust to the controller.  There are two nobs to control turning, forward and reverse.  Trying to get your fingers to obey was tricky.  You had to be careful with the turning because if you turned a smidge to hard, the Stingray completely turned around and fishtailed."
0,1,"So, at this time of year, we don't have much water to test him out in, but he does well on the snow!  After reading the reviews, I was a bit paranoid about this rover, but he has been doing great.  He stopped working once and I panicked, opening up the control panel and checking the circuits like some reviews told me to do, but they were all well connected.  It turns out that the rover just needed a battery change, because the kids left him on all night!  The kids love him and he goes over just about anything, so you may want to give him a chance."
0,1,"When I pulled the Morphibian from the box, I was initially impressed with what seemed to be it's hardy appearance. However, when I inspected the hand held remote, I was a bit dismayed by it's bent antannae and very skimpy feel. The batteries are easily installed - typical removal of a philipps screw and typical AA & AAA battery installation. Yes, you need both types for this toy to work: 3 AAs for the vehicle, and 2 AAAs for the remote. A bit inconvenient right from the go. I actually read the ""manual"" which was only a piece of paper about 4.25 x 11 folded in half, printed on both sides. Most of the instructions were common sense warnings not pertaining to the actual operation of the Morphibian. The remote must be held in both hands and has dual controls, Left & Right. Moving both forward makes the vehicle go forward, both backwards brings it into reverse. Turning is a difficult attempt of moving one forward or backward or each control in opposite directions. The turning of the vehicle was difficult for my kids (aged between 7-12) - even I had difficulty until I got the hang of it. The power of the Morphibian was impressive for such a little vehicle. On our hardwood floors it zipped across the floor quite quickly. It was fun to spin it around and maneuver it around obstacles. On semi-shag carpeting it slowed as would be expected. There was an immediate hesitation that was consistent through the operation of the Morphibian. It appears that there is not good contact in the handheld remote. We would push the controls forward and it seemed to be hesitant and than it would run for a while. I think over time this will only get worse and is pretty typical of other reviews that I've read. Probably the coolest part of the toy is it's ability to go through water. I placed it in the bathtub and slowly raised the water to right over the tire level. While the tub was filling to that point, the Morphibian would easily maneuver through the water. Once it floated free of contact with the tub, however, it became difficult to control. I found as long as I kept the wheels in contact with the tub surface, the vehicle would push through the water with no problem. I then put the Morphibian through one more test: snow. I live in the Midwest and we are experiencing a blizzard currently, so I took the toy outside to see how it would handle the elements. There was about 2"" of snow on the driveway and the Morphibian just couldn't get good enough traction to move. It is good to be reminded that it made no such claims either.So, overall - knowing now what I do about the toy, I probably wouldn't purchase one for my own use or for my kids use. It just doesn't perform well consistently. It is fun when it did perform, but just not enough to rank more than 2 stars."
1,0,"My son has three of the Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles.  He has this one, the one with the bugs, and the zoo animal puzzle.  He loves all three.  At first he just enjoyed taking the pieces out but now he has started to try to put the pieces back in.  I love that these puzzles are brightly colored, durable, and attractive.  I haven't noticed the paint coming off of them if he puts them in his mouth and he hasn't been able to destroy them when teething either!  Great puzzles!"
0,1,"Always love Melissa and Doug Chunky puzzles, and this is no exception. The pieces are high quality and have lived through a beating from a toddler. Still look new."
1,0,"we've had this puzzle for about a week and my granddaughters have enjoyed playing with it very much. Some of the reviewers have complained about what the puzzle is made of, but I haven't found any problems with it, and it seems to be very sturdy and well made. That's why I have given at such a high rating."
0,1,"Some of the older reviews are complaining that these aren't solid wood, but I bought mine in December 2013 and it's real wood. Pieces are big and chunky, perfect for toddler hands. The animals are cute and brightly colored. It's a great first puzzle and easy enough that little ones won't get frustrated. Older toddlers will master and outgrow it quickly, though (mine got bored with when she was around 22 months)."
1,0,This is perfect for toddlers. Simple and fun. Great for cognitive development. The color is bright too to help engage kids.
0,1,"The color and the shapes are  great for little hands, plus having real wood as a texture in the play area is pretty nice too!"
0,1,We purchased this for our 18 mo and he loves it.  All Melissa and Doug puzzles are outstanding in quality.  I have several in my cart ready for future purchase.
0,1,"I initially bought this for my soon-to-be born baby girl, but when my 2 1/2 toddler saw it, he insisted on mommy opening it.  He played with it for 10 minutes then got bored since it was too easy for him.  However, we did use the pieces to help him remember the names of the animals and the sounds they make.  He already knew most of the animals from his board books, but it helped having a 3 dimensional version that he can hold while making the sounds."
0,1,"I bought this puzzle for my son because a very similar one at daycare was his favorite toy.  He is obsessed with Old McDonald, and he loves playing with all the animals and singing Old McDonald.  This would be a great gift for any 2 year old."
0,1,"I was so excited to get this puzzle for my little ones. Unfortunately, the item description is misleading. The puzzle looks nice (before the kids get to it) and the chunky pieces were a perfect size! However, this puzzle is NOT hand painted. The puzzle pieces are just faced with a sticker, that easily comes off (in pieces!). That is not the quality I was expecting, especially from Melissa and Doug. I've had the puzzle for 2 months now, and 2 or 3 of the pieces have the stickers mostly peeled off."
0,1,"I think I have bought just about every wooden Puzzle made by Melissa & Doug. This one is a real cutie.  As usual, it is very well made, has bright colors and I always liked the same animal under the puzzle pieces for the younger grandchildren..  I had trouble with one of their 48 piece puzzles last fall and customer service was great.  That means a lot to me which is why I continue to deal and buy from Melissa & Doug."
1,0,THESE PUZZELS OF MELISSA AND DOUG ARE ALWAYS A BIG HIT WITH THE GRANDKIDS AND SO MANY TOPICS OF CONVERSATION WITH THE PUZZLE AND ANIMALS AND WHAT EACH DOES
0,1,"We started with the Melissa & Doug Vehicle Chunky set - and after my son being so in love with it, we had to get a few more.This one is SOOO FUN! As he puts the puzzle pieces in, I'll tell him what the animal is and what noises they make and he tries to repeat (for now at least, when I say Cow, he doesn't say mama). Ha!The puzzle is very sturdy. My son likes to peel off the pictures or rip up the pieces of his previous puzzles, with this - he hasn't succeeded.What I like about this is that the picture is on the board so he just has to match the shape on the puzzle piece and stick it to the board. It's helping him figure out sizes/shapes and fits. I really like this.As for complaints of previous reviewers: I don't expect this toy to be like the ones of olden days where they are hand painted and hand made and blah blah blah. It may last though this kiddos childhood, but I'm not planning on this to last through several generations. It does what I need it to do and for the price, come on, it doesn't get any better."
0,1,"Too easy for my toddler.  Shouldn't have pictures painted on of what they are. Thick pieces though, so they make cute little animal figures to play with and they can stand."
0,1,This is an excellent puzzle for very young children.  The pieces are chunky so kids can grip them better and wont have as much trouble getting them in.  Melissa & Doug products are well made and kids love them.  This puzzle is wooden so kids wont destroy it if they try to roughly put the pieces in.
0,1,"I bought 2 of this puzzle, one for a 2-year old and another one for a one-year old whose parents will help him with it.  The colors are great, the animals are cute."
0,1,"This is an adorable puzzle, I love the chunky pieces and how colorful it is.  I do sort of wish that the rhino and hippo weren't blue and purple, as that isn't realistic at all, but overall, a great puzzle."
0,1,My 23-month-old daughter loves this puzzle. I love that it includes animals like an ostrich and rhino that are not as common in animal books that she has. She plays with this puzzle all the time and the pieces are big and chunky and perfect for her grasp.
0,1,"We love Melissa & Doug puzzles! This puzzle is very well made and my kids really enjoy playing with it. It's educational, well made, and we just love it!"
0,1,"If you Play Zombies you know how quickly you run out of Zombies to place. If you add up the Zombies that appear just on the tiles from the main set there are 105.

0,1,I got a good deal on this doll crib and really liked that it has storage underneath for accessories. I did have issues getting it together and usually their dad does this stuff so may have been just me but those diagrams were frustrating me...once together though it adorable and seems durable. She just got it for christmas and absolutely LOVES it.
0,1,"I got this because I really wanted to get a bucket, shovels and a dump truck all at once and that is a big plus for this product.  But, my daughter has never really used the sandmill - it isn't very effective... meaning the sand doesn't come out very easily.  Also, I have a bit of an issue with the storage in that the pieces won't go into the bucket once everything is put together.  Just make sure that you don't need a ""self-storing"" group of toys and otherwise it is fun.  Also, very strong plastic and durable."
0,1,"My son is 2.5 years and we got this for him for christmas. We live back east and were unable to use is until a recent thaw. My son spent several afternoons vigorously playing with this toy (which he loved btw) The design is extremely innovative and my son has no problem manipulating the mechanism to make this work. We find that is works best with slightly damp sand or dry sand. Well, yesterday he was playing some game or another and got carried away and threw the blue ""under"" bucket, it landed on the side of the sandbox and cracked. My son isn't particularly strong. I think that something that is an outside toy should be able to withstand a bit more abuse than being thrown 2 feet by a 2 year old. The toy is still usable with the bucket used only as a base, it obviously won't hold water or much sand though. I am considering purchasing another set because he really does like it alot, and it is educational in the basic principles of inertia, I just really wish the materials used were of a better quality.Pros:- Educational- fun- Comes with everything needed to play- Truck works well and can be played with on it's own.- can be used with sand or water- packs wellCons:- Won't function with wet sand- materials are less than satisfactory and won't stand up to the abuse of a typical child- sandmill won't funtion if any of the pieces are missing."

1,0,"Nothing is less fun than a headless Woody doll.  Wish it had lasted a bit longer, but after a few weeks, the head came off with casual play, too.  Will have to inspect products like this instore before buying."
0,1,Our grandson asked us to get him a Woody for Christmas. he wanted this talking pull toy. We can wait till Christmas to see his face
0,1,Woody was purchased for my granddaughter.  She loved it. We had alot of trouble getting it out of the box and the box looked like it had been around the moon and back however the doll was ok.
0,1,"Ah, the wood and the king of the children, my children have had two lost. So I just bought another."
0,1,"This is a great toy.  Looks better in person than the picture suggests.  Looks exactly like Woody from the movies.  Not only that, but the pull string phrases are loud and clear and are definitely Tom Hanks' lines from the movie isolated for the toy.It stands up to a beating, is stitched together well, and Woody's height is correct relative to the Buzz Lightyear and Jesse and Bullseye (plush) figures being sold on Amazon right now.The only flaw is the hat.  It is a tough plastic that fits Woody but never stays on his head.Your kids will love it, if they love the movies.  No doubt about it."
0,1,I have tried to play the spoons by holding two in one hand but I have never been able to get a clear sound until I purchased this set.  These spoons make it so easy to get a wide range of sounds.  Lots of fun. Easy to hold.
0,1,"I bought this and the field mouse for my granddaughter who has a real mouse for a pet.  She thought they were so cute!  Really soft and just the right size,"
0,1,"A very well constructed toddler pull toy. The spinning smoke stack seems to work well on wooden floors and short pile carpets. It has a similar appearance to the black Brio engines that come with some of the wooden track starter sets, but this is much bigger. My 18 month old likes it, and I do too."
1,0,"This is an old-school pull toy. The heavy, wooden train pulls smoothly, causing the smokestack to spin. Both a toddler boy and kindergartner love it and have great fun dragging it around saying choo-choo. The pull rope is a good length and the only issue I've had so far is that I only own one."
0,1,"He doesn't play with it for long periods of time, but he always goes back for it. It's well made and the sounds are clear and fun. I don't find it loud or annoying at all. My grandson seems to like all the different feels that make the music start to play. We've had it a month or so and it is still one of his favorites. For me, it is a good toy and well worth the cost."
1,0,"I bought this as a gift for a puzzle lover and then couldn't resist getting one for myself. It is frustrating fun at the highest level. A challenge you will not be able to put down. I even had trouble taking it apart and putting it back together without the written directions. I have yet to do it on my own even after doing it with instructions once. The written history of the Gordian Knot and directions are done in a concise, interesting, and understandable accompanying book. It is hours of fun and challenging for all levels. If you like Rubik's cube and chess, you will love this as you definitely have to plot your moves ahead to be sure you are going in the right direction."
0,1,"I bought this for my 9 year old &#34;puzzle-kid&#34;, but it was my 10 year old &#34;non-puzzle kid&#34; that completed it first.  I even tried it and found it very challenging (in a good way).  The pieces are very solid and the instruction booklet is pretty helpful (except for one step that puzzled me)."
0,1,I tend to stress out a bit so my husband bought me this for my office as a stress reliever.  I love it! It is a great way to zone out for a little while.
0,1,"My son is 4.5 yrs, loved the Cars movie and now loves this Leapster game cartridge.  I had to pry it away from him after 3 hours of playing on the day he got it.  It is a wonderful learning tool for kids 4-6 who are working on letters, words, spelling, phonics and numbers.  The games are really fun and exciting, the characters have authentic voices from the movie, and there are multiple games to play.  I would give this game cartridge an A+, worth the 24.99 I payed for it.  If you have a child who loves Cars, they will love this!  I even enjoyed playing the tractor tipping game as I raced down the track as ""L. McQueen"" and watched in my rear view mirror to make sure ""Frank"" wasn't on my tail.Another great cartridge is the Letters on the Loose.Have fun and Ka Chow!"
0,1,My son loves to play his leapster leapfrog cars game. It keeps him entertained and away from doing miss haps around the house
1,0,"My kids have this toy, but even the adults get entertainment out of it.  It says whatever you say but in a high-pitched chipmunk-like voice that is very funny.  My kids think this toy is hilarious."
1,0,"I read a lot of the other reviews about how hard this game is to install, and all of them are right!  I think the problem is mainly the incredibly bad instructions.  I figured out after an hour that the code for my DVD player was fine the first time, I just wasn't pushing the red button fast enough, as the instructions made it sound like the screen would tell you when to push it, but actually the screen just shows a picture of the game floating around in space and you are supposed to guess that means your code was accepted and you need to push the button!  I figured it out mostly by chance, after trying the web site and the 800 number.  Shame on you, Leapfrog---you could write better instructions than that!!However, once I got the game going and figured out (also by chance) how to make it be in English and not Spanish) I was pleased to some extent with the product.  The game that came with the system is really just a demo, but my box came with another game attached to the outside and that one is better.  It has a variety of learning activities, like a car going down a road and you use a joystick to pick which way you want to go, thereby seeing a video about one of two animals.  I liked the real videos, as opposed to cartoons.My daughter is autistic and learns in unconventional ways, so although she is almost 4, this is a great product for her.  I had bought a V-Smile and it's so much beyond her.  Even her video game whiz 10 year old brother got frustrated with the games!  In this case, she easily can make SOMETHING happen, and so she actually pays attention.  I have never been a fan of electronic learning, but after a while, you do what works, and she will play for hours with an electronic phone that only plays a few sounds, so this will let her have a more varied experience!I haven't tried all the games I bought to go with this, but I will soon and will review them.So a mixed feeling---terrible instructions for adults, fairly engaging toy for kids."
0,1,My child loves these puzzles.  He got these for his first birthday and he is 20 months now and he still loves them.  The knobs are big for him to handle and the pieces are easy to put into their spots.  I would highly recommend these puzzles to anyone with young children.
0,1,"Our 15 month old has been playing with this for about 3 months, on and off. She is now able to get the shapes in the correct spot, and she is so proud!"
0,1,These chunky puzzles are a real winner. This particular one has fully painted pieces with screen printed tops. The pieces are great for stand alone play! 18 month old son loves it as there is a train (woo woo).
0,1,"I ordered this one along with Dora for my 2-year-old granddaughter, and this formidable twosome (Genevieve and Dora) has consumed practically all of her time this Christmas, upstaging the offerings from the other family members (so there, ""other"" grandpa).  The coolest thing about this doll is hearing my grand-tot learning a new name, pronouncing it ""Jenabeeve.""  One detail that impressed me: the arms bend at the elbows, allowing for a demonstration of graceful arm movement.  One curious detail: the hands and fingers are artificially dainty and small--so much so that the doll's mouth is abnormally large by comparison.  (I looked at my hands and mouth in a mirror just to verify my suspicions of the doll's designers taking liberties with anatomical verisimilitude.)  No big deal.  Better a doll's hands be unrealistically shrunken than its waistline.  Of course, the length of the legs is overextended--inspired by viewing too many Cyd Charisse or Busby Berkeley movies?  In any case, my granddaughter is not nearly so hypercritical of her charming little Jenabeeve, and I'm not planning on ordering an extra for myself (my cat, maybe)."
0,1,"As with all the Playmobil pieces my almost four year old daughter has, this ambulance will not disappoint.  SO many fantastic details!  A little time consuming to put together but totally worth it!The beauty of Playmobil toys is that they appeal to children of all ages.  Our daughter has been enjoying Playmobil for sometime now and I constantly see her discover new aspects of each toy and repurpose the pieces.  The ambulance is no exception.  Right now for her it is simply a great vehicle toy into which she piles all sorts of other things but as she grows she'll see all the wonderful details inside, like the saline drip and the defibrillator!!"
0,1,"I love this game for several reasons, the first being its cooperative spirit. Players team up against the Raven, trying to get fruit from the orchard into baskets before the Raven gets it.My four year old loves to make the ""caw, caw"" sound for the Raven and put the wooden fruit into the basket. I love the novelty of it being a German game and the fact that it has no plastic or toxic substances to worry about.  The Orchard is good for math skills, color recognition and camaraderie. Plus it's aesthetically pleasing and a little cheeky.  A Raven and fruit, what's not to love?  Orchard  would make a great game for pre-school as well as at home."
0,1,"My daughter loves these robots. She uses them in all sorts of ways. She builds with them like blocks. She plays with them like dolls or action figures. She pretends that they are rocket ships. She stacks them, lines them up, and puts them in cars. It is a great, versatile toy!"
0,1,I bought these for my 3 year old and he loves them.  They are made so they can be stacked in many different ways. Well made. Able to survive a game of &#34;Robot Bowling.&#34;
0,1,"I think I may have more fun with these than my sons do at this point. I'm really into toys without batteries that can be played with in multiple ways, and these sturdy, simple little robots fit the bill!"
0,1,Got these for my son for Christmas - loves all things Robot. They seem well made true test comes in a couple months but I know he'll love them!
1,0,It was really hard to find classic pictures on an Old Maid set. Great cards. My five year old daughters loves them!
0,1,My family has always loved to play Old Maid.  It's a great quick game for the oldest down to the youngest.  These cards are really nice quality with great pictures and names.
0,1,Our 4/5 year old loves this game and the whole family gets involved.  Good price and quick service.  The only criticism is that the pictures/colors on the cards make it a little difficult to match the pairs but that is a minor annoyance.  Great family fun.
0,1,"These cards are so great. The quality is very nice just like all eeBoo products, the pictures are great. The kids are still little so we have card holder for them, but it's nice for them to learn how to take turn and we get lots of good laugh all together!"
0,1,"Great product. Was purchased as a stocking stuffer, our daughter loves these and really enjoys this one. great price and great toy."
1,0,"I love that this is made of tin, just like the one I had when i was a kid. i absolutely love it!!!!"
0,1,"This is a great little kaleidoscope.  It can withstand the beatings of any toddler, and works every time.  It makes pretty designs, and the perfect size for little hands.  Great idea for stocking stuffer."
0,1,Bough it as stocking stuffer for kids - as I remember that I loved the magic of kaleidoscope as a kid myself. It was a hit!
0,1,"This is a nice little kaleidoscope for kids. The tin is a bit thin, but I expected that. The end cap with the beads on it rotates very easily, so it's great for little hands. The paint job is extremely vivid. It comes with a little tag, but otherwise lacked any sort of packaging. Each Christmas, we try to buy for our daughter a combination of tactile, electronic, and &#34;old-school&#34; types of toys. This year the kaleidoscope will be a stocking stuffer, and honestly, it just looks like something Kris Kringle himself dropped in the stocking. Any questions... just ask and I will answer. Thanks.SPO"
0,1,I bought this for my twin girls. I wanted a neat stocking stuffer for Christmas and didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on it.  It's constructed of metal but can see it could be easliy dented if played with too rough. The beads are very colorful and offer a variety of patterns. One thing I didn't expect is the size. This kaleidoscope is much bigger than I thought it would be. It's about the height of a 16oz bottle of water.Overall I am very happy and even bought one for a friends toddler.
0,1,I wanted to get my grandchildren a metal kaleidoscope instead of a cardboard one and am glad that I did.  It has beautiful images in it and the kids love it.
0,1,"As usual, Eeboo does a wonderful job with this game.  The pictures are fantastic - a work of art.  The pieces are thick and durable.  It's appealing and inviting.  We also have the Hasbro ""Original Memory Game,"" which has SEVENTY tiny cards with treacly, goofy cartoons on them, and I find it incredibly annoying.  The Life on Earth memory game is light years better - creative, artistic, thicker pieces, just much nicer overall.  Worth a few dollars more."
0,1,Got this for my oldest daughter this Christmas. She loves playing with it. Great way to start talking to a child about they're body because there's enough detail but not too much. Kinda wish things were mapped so I could call them the right names but I'll just google it.
1,0,"I had the boy version for my oldest, and my daughter took an interest to it but I felt she needed to have something that reflects her own body.  I feel it will be very interesting for a long time and it is a very well made and durable wood toy.  Worth every penny especially if you can snag it on sale."
1,0,I have the boy version and think it's so cute so i got this one for a friends daughter and they love it!
0,1,"I'm taking a jewelry class and our instructor urged us to buy decent headband magnifiers and not go cheap.  Harbor Freight had a few for under $10 that were awful.  So I figured the $38 for this would insure a good quality magnifier.It looks very similar to the one my instructor uses, but feels just a bit cheaper than I expected.  It is comfortable to wear, is adjustable, but unless my eyes are just plain shot, I have to hold things VERY close to see.  I was hoping to work with my hands on a workbench and use this, but it's not strong enough.  I have to bring things up to my nose.I don't think it's my eyes, and I have to doublecheck to make sure they sent me the correct magnification.I hope you find this review helpful!"
0,1,"I slip this magnifier over my head, tilt it to exactly the right position, then tighten the nuts on the side.  The crown can also be adjusted for the size of my head.  I purchased this first for detailed jewelry work but have since found that it is well suited for tiny counted cross stitch as well.  It does take me time to readjust for the task at hand, but once I get into the swing of it, I'm really good at lifting the magnifier above the crown so I can switch between the detail work and distance sight.  I think of it like working with reading glasses, but the magnifier allows for seeing things I cannot see otherwise, like solder melting and flowing or the space between the threads on a tightly woven canvas.  I can't imagine not having these and am so happy that the glass magnifier comes in different strengths and is replaceable as my vision changes or should the glass become scratched or broken.  I've had this for years with no problems and still use the original lens."
1,0,"These are great for close craft work, and even reading the footnotes/phone book.  I think I bought it a little stronger than I needed, which makes me have to get closer to the object than I intended.  Even so, they are a great help.  Comfortable to wear over my glasses.  I feel like my dermatologist!"
1,0,"My grandsons had this airplane out of the box and loaded with passengers and their luggage in record time!  Playing with the jet plane and their other Playmobil sets is the highlight of their day.  This is a big plane and holds lots of things, including their circus people and sometimes circus animals.  Thanks for a great, durable fun toy that will be around for many years to come!"
0,1,My boys 2 years and 4 years have spent a lot of hours entertaining themselves with this airplane.  Parts come off kind of easily but my 4 year old thinks its super fun to be the fix it guy and snap the parts back on quick.  I love watching them play with this!
0,1,"The easiest way to explain this game is to compare it to Settlers of Catan, but without the trading.  Each player will be collecting resource cards, although in this case the mechanism is choosing a pile of cards from the market, rather than rolling dice (Catan).  Then you build components of the temple to earn ""talents"" (rather than settlemens, cities, and roads).  There are special cards that either have bonus resources, or special abilities, but in almost every case you will acquire corruption for using them.  Corruption may help you build fast, and collect the most ""talents"", but whoever is the most corrupted at the end of the game is thrown to the crocs by Cleopatra.  There are only a couple ways to get rid of your corruption, so you definitely need manage your corruption and keep an eye on the other players.I'd only recently realized the similarity between Catan and Cleopatra because we've been playing Catan a lot lately.  The games are pretty comparable in terms of difficulty.  The big difference?  Cleopatra is gorgeously produced!  Across the board the components are better than Catan in every respect.  Artwork -- check.  Durability -- check.  Storage and packaging -- double check (this game has pretty much has some of the best packaging I've seen.  The quarry and most of the temple components lift right out and are ready for play with no fuss.)Due to the corruption game mechanic, this game clearly plays better with 5 people than with 3.  With more players it's harder to know who's likely to be most corrupted, or who's most likely got the most talents, and that makes the game more interesting.Not sure if this game is still in print, but if you can get your hands on it, you should!  You can't have my copy.This game is such eye candy!  You build the temple while you play!  It attracts attention when you play it.  Great concept.Definitely recommend!"
0,1,"I played this with my granddaughter and her parents and we had a good time.  Certain boards were a little more organized and she had better luck when using them.  She is 4 and got frustrated when she could not find her item to find.  She was getting better near the end of our play. My grandson, who will be three in August could find items right away.  I liked that they could both play.  The game is well made and I would recommend."
0,1,"My daughter enjoys playing with this and her Little Mommy Toddler doll, but the slide keeps falling off and the entire set will fall over pretty easily. Still, it's a pretty decent toy"
0,1,"I bought this mostly for the container.  I had individual play-doh products, like the barber set that came in it's own box.  I'm able to put ALL play-doh things into this container and everything is in one spot.  No more boxes and sorting.  I even still have space for more things like different colors and everything.  My daughter loves the variety of the toys and I love the convenience.  I'm going to buy it for presents for other families I know!"
0,1,"We bought this for our daughter when she was 6 months old (she's one now), and I believe we'll be seeing it in her bathtub for at least another year, if not longer.  It's a great mish-mash of things to play with.The cups are terrific (and they have nice soft rubbery rims for your little teethers), one is solid, and the two others have different sieves on the bottoms so baby can play pouring games.  They also stack on each other, and there is a place to fit them on top of the boat so they make a smokestack!The fisherman floats in his life ring, and you can also sit him on the top of the boat.The fish are fun to play with for an infant (one is a comb, and another has a nailbrush on it, so they can help with grooming too!), and when baby is older, they can be fished for with the fishing pole.The paddle wheel on the boat itself can be wound up, and then the boat will propel itself a short distance.And when bathtime is over, everything fits neatly into the boat for storage.I've tossed the whole kit and kaboodle in the dishwasher for cleaning without a problem, so it's easy to clean up if your little one has an accident in the tub.The only complaint I have with it is the portholes on the boat are set a little low, and it fills too easily, causing the boat to sink.  This is really minor -- Baby barely even notices.  But I do!Even with that, though, I would buy this again, and will probably buy it as a gift for other families."
0,1,"The roboreptile is about as capable as my old ers-110 aibo, but cost a lot less and is reptilian.  Also a bit slower.  By reptilian, I mean that it doesn't want to interact, it just wants to hunt, or guard.  In themselves, these modes are worth the price of the toy.It has 4 modes - roam, guard, remote control, and programmable.  Remote control is OK, but quickly bores because the critter isn't fast.  It lets you check what it can walk on/over.Roboreptile has a program mode, which is the biggest change from roboraptor.  (It's also a little faster when turning.)  Stringing behaviors together, however, also quickly bores because the critter can't run. or fightOne little pleasure is hooding.  It usually doesn't like being hooded and acts that way.Roaming/hunting is when it wanders around and occasionally roars or snaps at the air.  Interesting.  Feeding is not that interesting because you just poke a button on the remote.  Too tomagachi for me.Guard is fun because it can spook the unwary.Battery life is not impressive, use rechargeables.After a while, time to take it apart.  Type ""roboreptile hack"" into a search engine.  Then dig in.  It's easier than getting the critter out of the packaging.  Now the real fun begins!  I've met Tilden, the designer, and I suspect one of his goals was to flood the world with little motors, controllers, and sensors.  Those are the building blocks of robotics.  That and legos.  Can the body plastic fit together another way?  Can the tail be modified into a tentacle?"
0,1,"Learning Resources is my absolute favorite resource for our homeschool science and math 'library'. This magnet set is also really nostalgic for this child of the 90's. Puts me right back in the classroom where we had a ton of fun learning about magnetism. My children could spend hours playing with the magnets. You did it again, Learning Resources! Thank you!!!"
0,1,We do like this product.  We use it in our preschool class and the kids enjoy playing with the magnets.  My only issue is one of the magnet wands broke just a few weeks after we bought this and some of the magnets are very small.  We use this product a lot and I would recommend it with supervision.
0,1,"I think this toy is OK, I did find the speach thing a little annoying, but overall it is an OK toy.  My 2.5 yr old does try to move or hold the toy when it is talking and I am a bit worried about it getting broken arms.  Stories are cute, my little one isn't entirely sure about it yet."
0,1,"My 31-month-old son received this for Christmas and absolutely loves it.  He plays with it and the treehouse everyday.  I agree with one of the reviewers that it's annoying that some of the items jam up the moat.  My son's favorite part of the castle is the slide leading to the ""secret passage"".  The biggest complaint I have with the castle is that it's not sturdy and the pieces don't stay on the castle.  For example, my son can easily remove both the yellow stairs and the blue ramp, though I've repeatedly snapped them back on.  This has never been a problem with the Weeble Treehouse, which came fully assembled."
1,0,"My son is such a fan of Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles.  They have helped him name items from the puzzle and relate them to real life.  I just don't know what one of the insects are.  I know the butterfly is in the middle, but what is to the right of it? There is the spider and what is under that?  Another butterfly?  All and all, we will be buying more chunky puzzles.  Recommend!"
0,1,These puzzles are worth every penny.  They indestructible and my 18 month old granddaughter loves them.  We have just about all of the Melissa & Doug wooden puzzles.
0,1,"This is a great puzzle to get for your little one. My daughter loves this, it has helped her with putting things in the right spot and knowing the difference between a dog, a cat, etc. Also was a great price and shipped really quickly. will buy more"
0,1,"It's true that the Melissa and Doug toys have gone down in quality over the years.  The wood puzzles are now pressed wood, the colors are no longer painted completely on the pieces (only the top of the puzzle piece is painted), and the colors chip off much easier.  However, the puzzles are still great for the kids, and the toy is more durable than any of those silly cardboard puzzles on the market.  Recommended."
1,0,"The puzzle pieces are nice and big and can be used as pretend tools!  My toddlers love it, and they can put the pieces back together."
0,1,"My 1-year-old loves his tool puzzle. The colors are bright and attractive for him, and it is of very high quality. Melissa & Doug products are nearly always great, and this one is no exception."
1,0,"Love your products!  Of course the boys used the hammer to hammer everything in site!  Very nice puzzle. Very good quality,"
0,1,"Very durable wood puzzle. It has super cute sea life creatures. There are pictures underneath the puzzle pieces to help match the pieces. The star fish was a little difficult for my 2.5 yr old son but other than that, he got it in no time. A great learning puzzle."
0,1,"My daughter is completley enchanted with this game. there is something about the marbles and flipping fish that she just loves. She enjoys playing the game with us but she also plays it by herself. Its a great game.. easy to assemble and does not require batteries, that's always a plus!"
0,1,"My son loves the idea of having his or anyone's ""fish"" (marbles) getting ""eaten"" by the piranhas.  The game is smaller and not quite as elaborate as I expected for $25, but it is enjoyable and another game I don't mind playing with the kids.  Not having to buy batteries is a definite bonus!"
0,1,Very well made. Completely wooden clown & pieces. Multi colored. Very easy to play and lots of fun for the kids. This is a toddler game and my four year old enjoys it.
0,1,We bought our first one of these at a toy store near my parents.  We gave it to our daughter for her 3rd birthday.  She does ask to play it from time to time and I suggest it often.  It is SO WELL MADE!  Solid wood and nicely painted.  This toy really feels like a high quality.  I am surprised it is not more expensive.  I ended up ordering five from amazon to give to all of our upcoming 3-4 year old parties.
0,1,I bought this for my son's second birthday.  He has sensory processing disorders and he doesn't talk.  Someone told me that this toy taught sign language so I thought it would be perfect for him.  We've only tried it a couple of times but the graphics are so bad that it is hard to even see the signs being taught.  The keyboard functions as a stand alone game (without hooking up the rest of it to the TV) and my son is perfectly happy playing with it like that.
0,1,"My toddler refuses to play with this toy.  I bought this for her when she was nine months old and she showed no interest.  The quality of this product was much poorer than I expected.  The Leapfrog system looks much cuter.  My daughter is now almost two and since we bought it I have tried it about once a month.  Even though she loves the toddler computer games, she still shows no interest in this.  To be fair, the toy does have alot of educational value if you can get your child to play it.  I'll keep trying, but I'm beginning to think that this toy just isn't for us."
0,1,"We bought this for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas.  Like for so many others, our clock didn't work.  Serious dissapointment.  BUT we called the company and they sent us out a new clock and keyboard, free of charge, and now it's working fine.  I suggest others call the company too!  And our daughter LOVES it now!"
0,1,"My parents bought this desk for my almost 2 year old daughter for Chanukah.  We were very excited about this gift and we thought that our daughter would love it.  When my dad put it together, I was disappointed that it did not come with a little chair or stool, but I figured I could look past that.  However, I quickly learned that this desk has a major flaw.  The desk is designed to lift to reveal a piano.  When the plastic top is down to cover the piano, it can easily be lifted.  It doesn't lock into place.  My daughter accidentally slammed the plastic desk onto her fingers.  We also have a baby and I immediately became afraid that the baby would try to pull up on the desk to reach for the piano and end up getting her little fingers hurt.Believe it or not, this serious design flaw was not the only problem with the desk.  Not one hour after it was assembled, it stopped working.  We tried using different batteries - even though the batteries we put in the first time were brand new - and it still didn't work.Normally Fisher Price toys are great, but this one should have been better designed."
0,1,I bought this for my son's 1st birthday. He's still playing with it a year later. Great toy that sparks the imagination.  I bought the companion farm stand too but he isn't a big fan of that.  Just get this barn and be done with it.
0,1,"The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I believe they have changed the type of plastic these toys are made with.  When I was a child, I remember these toys being made from a thick heavy plastic of high quality.  Now they are made with typical plastic you can find on any toy.  But regardless, my daughter loves the farm noises and carries Farmer Jed all around the house with her.  Great toy!"
0,1,This is a must for boys and girls! Could not recommend highly enough! This is a fantastic toy with sounding animals and a great barn setup. It is a good size so two can play at the same time. My kids love love it from the moment it was opened. Absolutely fantastic product from Fisher Price. A name you can trust to make really good educational and fun toys.
0,1,"My 2yo is only mildly interested in this toy.  She would rather carry around the animals than mess with the whole thing.  The silo pops off daily.  I don't really know why bc it's really hard for me to pop it back into place.  The sounds only sound if you push a button or close a door.  So, I don't really know how it teaches correct sounds for specific animals.  My daughter only messes with it for 5 min at a time, then picks it up and throws it into the toybox.  I would not buy again."
0,1,"Fisher-Price toys are junk these days.  My son does like it so I am glad I bought it, but this toy is definately not worth the money. The barn doors didn't make noises when they were opened.  I didn't want to have the hassle of sending it back and getting a new one so I took the bottom off to see if I could fix it myself.  The circuit board in it looked AWFUL.  I don't know how those soldered connections passed quality control (if there is any quality control).  I managed to super glue a bit of cardboard so the the switch would work.  The only reason I am not fuming is because I got it off Toys r Us when they had buy one get one free on FP toys..and I had a $5 gift card.Not impressed at all."
1,0,"My 19 month old received this as a present for Christmas.  She absolutely loves it.  She likes to play with the animals and say the animal noises.  It has provided hours of laughs already.  She has also figured out how to make it play the animal noises and is able to identify which animal goes where in the barn based on the noises that it makes.  My parents were able to find it cheaper at another retailer prior to the holiday, however post holiday it looks like this is the best price.  Overall, a great purchase and a great toy."
1,0,"My 12 month old got this as a birthday gift, and completely loved it.  Its been about 3 months that she's had it, and still loves it.  The little animals, doors, song, animal sounds, etc. captivate her imagination and keeps her engaged in the toy over and over again.  The only complaint I have is that she can remove the silo off very easily and its hard to get it back on.  Its made with quality, and I have no safety concerns what so ever."
1,0,"My daughter had this from her toy library one week.  She just turned 4.  She found it very boring, as did I.  It would be ok for a 2 year old.Very heavy and bulky, and not much to do with it.Personally, I'd buy Playmobil 123 for a young child.  It's more interesting, also more aesthetic.  This is kinda ugly."
1,0,"I've read some older reviews and see there's some disappointment over the changes in the various incarnations of this toy.  I don't see why.  We have the 2013 version and it's as cute and fun as it can be.My daughter received this farm for her 2nd birthday, and the whole family has enjoyed it since.  The kids (ages 2 and 4) love the cute Little People animals, and especially the way the rooster launches them down the slide and the animal noises.This is a wonderful addition to our Little People collection.  Solid 5 stars!"
0,1,"OK, I admit I don't own this model of the farm and I never will. Not as long as touch and feel animals are with it! We do own another version of the farm and love the farm itself.What is Fisher Price thinking with the stupid touch and feel little people!?!? Don't they know babies and toddlers put these figures in their mouths! How on earth are you supposed to sanitize/clean one with fur on it?! I've heard of many parents putting the little people figures through the dishwasher to clean them and they hold up great. Well Fisher Price is putting an end to that with all the glorious new textures/materials they are adding to a toy kids suck on.We own just about every little people toy put out in the past 6-7years and I won't be buying anymore if they keep changing them to the touch and feel. They are taking the great as it was little people line in a bad new direction.I recommend looking around for an previous version of the farm. Or at last resort, getting this one and chucking the touch and feels and acquiring the regular animals where and when you can."
0,1,"My nephew has a previous version of the Fisher-Price farm, and it has much more going on than the new one my son just received as a gift. My nephew's farm has a room for the farmer to sleep and a room with a work bench, both of which have sound effects, the chicken has a nest to sit in that clucks, the pig has a muddy patch that oinks, etc, and there's even a roundabout that plays a song. The new version has way fewer sounds and areas for play. The silo was added for the new version, which is nice since it can store the smaller parts, but I wish Fisher-Price had made the farm more interesting instead of less interesting. I also feel this set is overpriced for what you get.Update: Well last month at 15 months old my son suddenly finds the farm to be more interesting than ever. He is always playing with the animals and putting them in the barn and everywhere else. He doesn't really care about the sounds, seeing as how there are hardly any sound effects it's not a surprise. So, yes, it's overpriced and could be better, but looks like he's going to get a lot of play out of it after all."
0,1,"My nephew loved this and wore the binoculars around his neck the rest of the day.  He wanted binoculars, and I had no idea. Thank you for your prompt delivery. A perfect late birthday gift for a great nephew that loves to explore."
0,1,I love this stuff! It's really fun to just hold in your hands while you watch TV or ride in a car. My children (7 and 4yrs. old) also enjoy it. It's a bunch of tiny styrofoam balls that stick to each other and feel sticky but your hands are perfectly clean and comfortable once you put the foam down. Not appropriate for toddlers who put everything in their mouth.
0,1,"This kit is a fantastic value for the fun that it contains.  Purchased as a gift for my nephew.  The first one didn't work but that was due to &#34;operator error&#34; and not the kit itself.  Love the variety offered.  For the price, it was an AMAZING deal, as this kit is huge."
0,1,my 7 year old sons has been enjoying this since Christmas. It's teaching him to be patient and not rush through it. The bones are fragile so it can't be something that is done quickly. He is enjoying finding the new and different bones and trying to figure out what part of the dinosaurs body they belong to. I recommend this.
1,0,OMG where has this been all my life its awesome can hold lots of barbies and accessories so there isn't barbies everywhere and it makes for quick clean up and it has wheels so she can play outside with her friends or bring with her on sleepovers.  Its great
0,1,Anything that stores and organizes toys I love! Anything that can stand up to her 3 yr old little brother is AMAZING! She takes this thing everywhere and my son tries to destroy it but it is still holding strong!
0,1,"Fairly easy to assemble (you'll have the most trouble snapping the wings in but not hard at all once you've figured it out), this reinvention of the X-Wing shows marked improvement over the original released in '99. Not only that but it comes with the ability to change the markings on the wings so you can personal it to be either Luke Skywalker's Red 5 X-Wing (and have him serve as pilot) or change the markings to be Wedge Antilles' Red 3 fighter and place him in the pilot seat. Both pilot minifigs are included as well as R2-D2. But wait -- as an incredible bonus, Lego has decided to throw in classic Star Wars: A New Hope versions of Han Solo, Princess Leia & Chewbacca. Tremendous value -- available at Lego Shop or Toys R Us for the suggested retail (beware of the secondary market jacking up the prices of this set)."
0,1,I got this for my kids last Christmas and both of my kids (3 and 6) LOVED it.  Unfortunately within two weeks we had the same power problems as many other reviewers and it is now useless. Fisher Price needs to recall this toy and fix the problems before it will be worth purchasing. Dont waste your money.
0,1,"My daughter goes off and on with this toy, like any other toy, she likes to shake and hit it, not sure if she cares that it makes the music, she does like the maraca aspect to it.  I could do withou the spanish and she flips the switch and then spanish comes out, talk about irritating."
0,1,"I was so happy to find these Maracas. I had bought them several years ago for my great-grandson, and wanted the same ones for my 1 yr. old great-grandson, but discovered they aren't available in stores and longer. They can be found, but at some ridiculous prices. Kids love them and were worth the price here."
0,1,"Me and my daughter love this toy.  I usually take the shakey one and she takes the music and lights one and we dance around together, she has a blast!!!  Good battery life too."
0,1,"My daughters both love to bang the maraca that sings on anything and everything.  They love watching it change colors and get excited when it gets through the colors or up to ten.  I love how it can be changed from English to Spanish.  It's been beaten up countless times and still functions perfectly.  I just have one complaint - what is the deal with the non-singing maraca?  The kids don't pay a bit of attention to it.  In fact, I couldn't even tell you where it is right now!  If both of them sang, it would be a perfect toy in my book."
0,1,"Well, I bought this toy for my friend's, then, one year old daughter.  I think she would have had fun with this toy, if the stupid thing would turn off. The little girl played with it for a minute, sat it down to play with other things she had just gotten for Christmas, and it still kept making noises. My friend and I turned the button to 'off' sat it back down and surprise! It still kept making noises. Had it not been for this MAJOR flaw, I would have rated the toy very well. But the point of an off button is so...oh, I don't know...the toy actually shuts off."
0,1,"I got this for my 5-month-old son. He still enjoys playing with it now at almost 10 months. There are LOTS of activities, the music is great, the voice is pleasant. I have 3 other activity tables and this has the most bang for the buck.For those who say it's too loud--I find almost ALL children's toys too loud. I simply put masking tape over the sound slots to tone it down a bit. Of course this will no longer be an option once my son develops his ""pincer grip"" and can pull it off.[UPDATED] My son is now 22 months, and still enjoys this toy. It's no longer an every day toy, but he still boogies to the music every once in a while."
0,1,"Our close friends bought this for their daughter (8 months old) but our 2 year old son loves playing with it too!It is very durable and the batteries last a long time.  As a parent, I love that it doesn't get annoying (you know what I mean) and teaches the user songs and things that aren't on every other toy.  There are lots of buttons to push, things to open and close, and things to turn and crank.This would be an excellent table for your standing baby!"
0,1,"I purchased this for my then 6 month old when he surprised me by learning to pull up to standing and it became an instant favorite. The Leapfrog Learn and Groove Musical table is sturdy, well designed, has catchy tunes and music. My son is now 9 months old and still seems to be his favorite! It's a safe place for him to stand and play without worrying about him pounding on my laptop! :) I would highly recommend this toy to any parent looking for a fun, interactive toy for their baby."
1,0,"This toy is great.  When they are crawling or even just rolling you can take two of the legs off so they can play with it.  It keeps my son entertained for at least a half hour.  When he gets bored with it he rolls over and kicks the keyboard and that entertains him for another few minutes.  This toy is durable, fun and great for all ages.  My niece loves it too and she is 18 months old.  I would purchase this again in a heartbeat!"
0,1,I bought this for my grandson 5 years ago and didn't hesitate to buy it again for my granddaughter now.  She loves it.  There are many activities to stimulate her learning and keep her occupied.
0,1,"Basically we parents have only two choices for this type of activity table: this LeapFrog Learn & Groove and the Fisher Price. I read a lot of reviews before deciding on this one, and we've been very happy with it. There are plenty of musical variations that are really enjoyable for both baby and parents... the sound quality is excellent, and the songs are surprisingly not annoying. The table space is well-allocated to different ""modalities,"" including buttons/keys, things that slide (trombone and cello)... my son really likes the frog with banjo (lever and spinner). I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons 1) it's so lightweight that any baby pulling up or leaning while playing will knock it over-- our fix of applying adhesive velcro to the bottoms of the four feet has worked for several months now (attached to an interlocking foam playmat on the floor), and 2) it would be more fun if the book in the center of the table had more than one page to flip."
0,1,"The LeapFrog Learn & Groove Musical Table is a wonderful toy that should give your child many years of enjoyment.  My grandson began playing with this at five months old and is still enthusiastically using it seventeen months later.Our little one received this when he was born; he began playing with it once he was able to sit up.  At that time, either his parents or grandparents would sit with him on the floor and turn the table so that he could become familiar with the different activities.  We did, initially, push the buttons and turn the ""pages,"" but he soon was able to do those things on his own.When our grandson began to crawl, we no longer turned the table; he had to move around the table to play with the option he wanted. As for its durability, the table withstood his sitting on it, even though he was a larger baby.Once he began to pull up, my son-in-law attached the legs so that our grandson could use the table to hold onto as he moved from activity to activity.  This gave him the confidence he needed to ""walk"" and the motivation to move from place to place safely.  The legs were easy to put on; the seams were smooth and we found no sharp edges that might cut a little one's skin.  Any such issues could have been easily resolved using fine grit sandpaper or a file.  Our little one continues to play his ""piano,"" as this is what he named his LeapFrog Learn & Groove Musical Table.  Rather than walking around the table, he sometimes lays across the table to reach an activity.  At 31 pounds, he is no light-weight, but the table has shown no signs that it cannot support that weight.As a grandparent, I like the variety of familiar song snippets the LeapFrog Learn & Groove Musical Table plays; the various instruments and musical styles that are included in its repertoire; and the fact that a child must move through numerous choices instead of repeatedly, without interruption, playing only one song.  The lively music and minimum of flashing light options is delightful.I highly recommend the LeapFrog Learn & Groove Musical Table to any parent or grandparent who wants a sturdy, fun-to-play-with, and long-lasting toy for their own little one.  It is something that will encourage a love of music, particularly if a child begins to play with it early in their life.  The LeapFrog Learn & Groove Musical Table would also be an excellent gift for anyone who is having a baby or as a first birthday gift.  It is a good value as it has a longer play-life than many toys.  In my opinion, the LeapFrog Learn & Groove Musical Table is definitely a 5-star product."
0,1,"My son got this table for his 1st birthday and loved it.  It's parent-friendly with 2 volume settings and un-obnoxious music.  Our son played with it for over a year and then we put it away for his sister to grow into.  She played with it on the floor before she could stand, and then grew into it standing up.  She also played with it for long periods of time.  My son was 3 by this time, and still enjoyed having it out again.Awesome toy!"
0,1,One of my son's most favorite toys!  So many things to play with here.  Highly recommend.
1,0,"This toy has easily detachable legs. We left the legs off so that my grand daughter could crawl to and play with the toy on the floor. She absolutely LOVES this toy, there are many parts to manipulate that produce lights, sounds, actions and music. She quickly learned cause and effect and is continuing to learn from the toy.Caution: At first we had the legs of the toy on, but the baby tried to pull herself up on the toy and it tipped over on her. We took the legs off and haven't put them on again."
0,1,"My son (12 months) has this toy over at his grandparents' house.  He loves all the different songs and actions that it has to offer.  Seems like there's never a dull moment with this thing, so many different ways to play with it.  His favorite right now seems to be opening and closing the little door on there.  I have yet to see anything that I can complain about with this toy!"
1,0,We have a 9 month old that is happiest when he's standing and he loves this table. The dual mode of music and words is fun and the Spanish is a bonus. Only thing to watch out for is that the table is very light and if our little guy tries to lift him self up from the floor the table will flip over bringing them both down. It's really not a huge negative because you can never take an eye off of a 9 month old anyways and all you have to do is hold down the table while he pulls up. Once he's up there he's as happy as can be. Overall a good value for the price and will hopefully keep his interest once he starts to learn words.
0,1,"My son's babysitter bought this table for him when he was 11 months old and just getting into standing for long periods. Soon, I was joking that it made her obsolete. He spent about an hour a day, in small increments, just walking around the table (there's something interesting on every side) and manipulating all the various tabs, switches, knobs, and buttons, enjoying the sounds they produced.This toy is brilliantly designed. Here are my favorite features:1. It's pleasant for mommy to listen to. No shrill ""fake baby"" voices or cacophonous ""music."" The piano keys play pleasant jazzy riffs that actually sound really musical. The voice is an accomplished-sounding female singing in a jazz/R&B; style. There are a great multitude of sounds and songs on this toy, and none of them are hideous, jarring, or overly loud. Mommy's nerves appreciate that. In fact, many times I found myself scat-singing along with the joyful female voice!2. The controls are all different -- not just an assortment of buttons. There's a ""book"" with a ""page"" that ""turns""; there's a banjo with a neck that moves; there's a spinner; there's a compartment that opens and shuts; there's a ""slide"" on a trombone, etc. Flipping certain switches had the effect of changing ""modes,"" which kept the kid engaged for long, long periods, as he tried to figure out what controlled what and what kinds of effects each switch might have.3. There's a Spanish mode. It's always good to expose tykes to language early, and this is a pleasant start. The instrumental songs are different in Spanish mode, too; they're, well, Spanish songs.4. It's a sturdy little table, well able to handle the weight of a leaning toddler.About a year ago, when my boy was 2, we had to put the table away for space reasons (construction work). Just after he turned 3, we took it out again, and he lit up with joy and fell to playing with it passionately once again. That's what I call a great toy."
0,1,"I got this used from a friend and my daughter loves this table. she can pull her self up to it and play for a long time, seems like she doesnt get bored with it as easily as some. Very durable plastic and its nice because you can adjust the volume of the music."
0,1,"I bought this based on other reviews and others that had the older version.  I don't know what the older version was like, but one thing I really do not like about this is that it is so incredibly light, that my son has been pulling it on top of himself while trying to use it as leverage to stand up ever since he was about 7 months old.  Also, it's so light that when he's standing playing with it, it scoots across the carpet and he ends up falling.  The idea is a good one, but it seems too cheaply made.  A bit of sand weights in the legs would've taken this toy from average/needs work to pretty great.  It's a baby's toy.  It's for babies that are learning to stand.  It should be designed to not fall on top of them when they use it to stand up and should be designed to stay steady when they play with it.  It's disappointing. I had high hopes for it, but someone either got lazy or the person that designed this never had kids."
0,1,I got this toy from someone and my boys love it. It is very durable and is educational. My boys love to play with it all the time. Especially the younger ones. I would say this toy is probably for 6 months on up. Once my oldest son reached the 14 months old mark in age he lost interest in it. So it is good especially for the younger babies who can stand or lean against it.  The good thing about this toy is it doesn't just do one thing so being bored with it isn't possible!
0,1,We love all the Leap Frog toys and between my two daughters we own quite a few.  This was a gift and a wonderful addition as my youngest learns to pull up and stand.  My toddler thinks it is pretty cool as well.  One thing I would note is that the legs are actually green in ours.  The sound is great and is easy for both of my girls to push the various buttons.
0,1,"We received this for Christmas for our non-crawling 11 mo. She loves this ""table"" (though it is not yet installed on its legs). I like that this will be a fun toy for her in two different positions (plate and table?).We had a very similar version of this toy 8 years ago for our first child. It was a great toy back then, too. Thanks to LeapFrog for not messing up a toy with too many themes, interactions, lights, until your kid doesn't know what to look at first.A quick kudo for the fantastic no-hassle box. It was easy to wrap, open and recycle."
0,1,"We bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months old.  She LOVED the toy back then!  She would stand up on it, and just play with it for what seemed liked forever.  When she started to cruise around furniture and pull up on things, she also loved this table.  She couldnt get enough of it.Now at 16 months, she rarely ever plays with it.  I dont know if its because she has so many other toys or why.. but she isnt interested in it anymore.  Really, she only used the table for about 6 months.. and once she started walking she was no longer interested in it.It is a very good toy, but I would recommend getting this toy for your child while he/she is young.. b/c when they get older like my daughter, they may not be so interested in it anymore.  Its a fun toy though :)"
0,1,"Perfect height to stand or sit- very educational- great quality, and bright colors! love it! Overall A+ and great purchase!"
0,1,I bought this when my daughter was learning to stand up by herself and she used it so many times even now that she walks. It is very entertaining! It has 2 different volumes (not too loud but loud enough to understand what is said and played). The Spanish version is also very good.
1,0,"Great toy, we've had ours for almost a year, and it still works great!My son likes it, it play music, sings the alphabet and more. Fun toy."
0,1,Our little gal loves this toy. She crawls over to it and stands up on it 10-15 times a day. Only wishes there were more flip pages on the plastic book in the middle. It acts as a switch - so I guess the design would have to be totally different. Other wise - this toy is great!!!! Very entertaining!
0,1,Seriously one of my child's favorite toys! I even think it helped her learn to pull herself up to a stand (be sure to keep a hand on the table when your child tries to stand with it so it won't turn over). She could also open and close the blue door alllll day. The only downside is that the songs get stuck in your head and you may find yourself singing them in public. It is worth it because my baby is so happy when playing with this toy. Buy it-your baby won't be disappointed!
1,0,"Great fun for the kids, our is quite old so they are very durable, I just wish it was a little quieter.Lots of interesting and different things to do, but I find it a little repetitive to listen to them playing with."
0,1,"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 9 months old.  She had one at daycare and seemed to enjoy playing with it.  It has served us well and now she's 13 months old.  I know it will last us through multiple children!  I have 2 suggestions for improvements - 1. there should be rubber on the bottoms of the legs to avoid it being used as push toy, it slips all over if the kid puts any weight on it which can be dangerous; and 2. the legs should be designed so they either fold in half or can be stacked and clipped or clicked into place underneath the top, this would make transporting it 100 times better.  Other than that, your child will love this thing!"
1,0,"My son was given the Spanish only version of this toy, and he loves it. The set up was really easy, which is a bonus for me, since every toy now comes with an hour of assembly. The legs are removable, so if your little one likes to try and use it as a climbing step like my son, you can remove them and make it a toy that sits flat on the floor.There are 2 settings, a music notes version where all the keys play music of some kind, and a ""learning"" version where the music is in the form of singing colors, shapes, numbers, and words.  DO NOT BUY THIS TOY IF YOU WANT SOMETHING FOR YOUR CHILD TO ONLY PLAY MUSIC ON. This isn't that kind of toy.So far, my only complaints are that the little door that makes sounds when it is opened or closed comes right off. It wasn't given enough hinge to keep it in place when it is tugged on, even slightly, I'm trying to come up with a way to fix that. Also, My son has had it less than a month and the batteries are already dead. I wish they had made it take larger batteries that might have lasted longer. He does play with it a lot, but I would prefer longer battery life.My new favorite feature of toys is the volume switch! This toy has 2 volume settings (the on/off switch is on the bottom) and the first setting is on the lower volume! Which is great if you're turning the toy on blindly and don't want it on full volume.I haven't had any of the problems with flimsiness, musical skipping, or a lack of durability that some of the 1 and 2 star raters have had. In fact, I've dropped it from a few feet a couple of times, tripped over it once, and my son has tipped it over numerous times. It still works just fine."
0,1,"I got this for my baby when she started pulling up on furniture, and this quickly became her favorite thing. It's bilingual (not a trait we use, but some might like), it's only musical on one setting (my preference), teaches colors and numbers on the other, and has many different types of objects to play with. Highly recommend!"
0,1,"My little girl is 7 months old and has really learned to pull herself up and has even begun cruising around this table.  She loves it and it really keeps her attention!  We have had no problems with it sliding or tipping over and my daughter is not very stable on her feet yet.  My only problem with it is the little flap/lid thing came over pretty easily, but I wasn't that upset about it so I just left it off.  Otherwise this toy is awesome!"
1,0,"We received this toy when our baby was about 6 months old, and he is now 9 1/2 months old.  We mostly wanted it to encourage him to practice standing.  He was delighted and amazed by the toy right away, and still really enjoys it now.  I wish that some of the things that you manipulate on the toy had more of a variety of sounds and noises that they make (a few things have a lot of variety of songs/noises, but some only make a few sounds.)  Better yet, it would be cool if you could put in different computerized chips to change all sounds/songs.  But, even though we, the parents, are tired of some of the noises, my son isn't yet.  A few concerns about safety and durability:  He ripped off the little green ""open-close"" pocket door right away  It easily snaps back on- but he has ripped it off several times.  He also has managed to pull the whole table down onto the floor, on top of himself several times.  Thankfully he hasn't really been injured by this yet- but the table top has some heft to it, so he could potentially hit himself in the head pretty hard with it.  Also, the bottom edges of the plastic legs are a little sharp and could probably scrape him or hit him in the eye."
0,1,"Our daughter is 9 months and she loves to bang on this. She's pulling herself up on everything, so it's really nice to have something safe (i.e. not a coffee table or entertainment center) and very stable for her to focus her attention on. She's still way too small to really get much out of the educational side of this, but it's seems very 'learning friendly'."
0,1,"We got this as a baby registry gift, and brought it out for our son when he was 6 months old.  He is now 11.5 months, and still plays with it on a daily basis.  At first it was a floor toy, and it was a great activity for him as he was learning to sit on his own and improve his balance.  When he was learning to pull to stand, we inserted the four feet.  It was a steady toy for him to learn to pull himself up, and it was rewarding to him to press the buttons when he did stand up!  He LOVES the little frog with the banjo, so cute!  He doesn't use the slider part very much, but all the other buttons/activities he uses regularly.  It helped him learn to cruise because he could walk all the way around the table.  Now he is walking on his own, and he still walks over to this toy to play with it.  It has great features, with music, colors, numbers and the alphabet.  He loves to dance to the music, and to beat on the ""drums"".  This is a must have toy in my opinion!"
0,1,"the onlky thing I have a concern about is that the legs on this table could use a rubber pad.  The table slides evan on carpet when baby is standing at it.  But the table is interesting to them, fun, and educational.  overall this is a good table."
0,1,"My son loves playing with this table. He loves putting blocks inside the little compartment and opening and closing the door. The music mode has a lot of fun sounds and songs and the learning mode does colors, shapes, counting, opposites, and ABCs. I wish it were a little taller. I mistakenly thought from he product description that the table came with two sets of legs to change the height; that's not the case. We were hoping the table would give my rather tall little guy incentive to pull up but he can reach everything just fine from kneeling. Other than that, it has been a great toy!"
0,1,My 13-mth.-old loves this toy - we got it for him for Christmas.  He loves the music and is learning cause and effect by hitting the drum.  The learning tools are a great foundation for the future.
0,1,Gift for our granddaughter's first birthday. She loved the noises it makes. She still loves music and dancing! She wants to go to dance class.
0,1,"Sometimes hits dont make it trigger. Have to whack it pretty hardA more sensitive sensor should be used. However, son enjoys this (6 months).Music mode and drum mode is kind of annoying. Background music and not the same sound every time. I would suggest Drum mode, and then options to have different sounds selected instead of rotating."
0,1,"We bought this for our 4 year old daughter last week, and I don't think she's played anything else all week! She is a true animal lover and this game is just perfect for her. Its very educational and fun. She loves the real animal photography, no cartoons.  I love the little ""speed round"" that happens after winning a certain amout of points. The kids must answer ten questions about the animal they are learning about. My daughter cannot read yet and she still understands it.  I love this game! I wish they had another one!! how aout a sequel???"
0,1,"I bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas.  I was concerned that he would lose interest in it or not be able to do it because the age recommendation is 8 and up.  The instructions were very easy to read and follow.  Of course my son can't read, so we explained the directions to him and soon he was making his first tray of bugs.  He was able to do the whole process by himself, with only our supervision when it came time to actually cook the bugs.  It really is easy.  It's a little addicting, too.  We have a ton of these little bugs laying around, now.  My husband and I have also made some bugs, its very fun.  We still have plenty of bug making goo left over so a little really does go a long way.I don't understand the big deal about the light bulb; to me it was no different than having to buy batteries for toys.  After I purchased the Bugmaker I went to the grocery store and bought a light bulb.  It wasn't hard to find, or hard to install.Our family liked the Creepy Crawlers Bugmaker so much that I went out and bought another one for a friend's son."
0,1,"this toy was a huge hit at christmas. It was all my 4yo could talk about. The oven works just like the easy bake oven that I remember as a child.... except the creations in this oven are icky, rubbery bugs. What's not to love?The oven requires a 60 watt candelabra bulb (not included). Once the bulb is installed, you just plug it in and go. The kit came with 3 color bug solutions (orange, black and green) and a special FX tube that I'm not sure actually does anything ""special"". There are 2 metal plate molds and a spatula for smoothing the goop into all the mold crevices. You fill the molds with your ""goop"" and get a grown up to help put the mold into the oven, then wait for 7-9 minutes, remove the mold into a ""cooling tray"" filled with water. The instructions tell you to let cool for 8 - 25 minutes, but honestly, the tray cools down in just a few minutes. Then scoop out the bugs and you're ready to make more.The bugs are NOT edible....just rubbery creepy fun.As far as safety goes, the oven seems to be built well. The oven can not be turned on while the door is open, and then once the door is closed and the the light is on, the door will not reopen until it's not only turned off, but also cooled down. There is a rudimentary heat gage on the front of the machine - when the arrow is at the bottom of the window, oven is hot, door is locked. When the arrow is at the top of the window, oven is cool, door can open. While none of this takes the place of parental supervision, I found these to be nice safety features.The cooking bugs do emit a plasticy odor that was mildly unpleasant, but not unbearable. the smell dissipates quickly. Also, we did spill some of the liquid goop on a shirt and it washed out with no stains or visible mess.While this toy is not really my cup of tea, I can not stress enough how much my son LOVES this toy. He will literally spend hours creating new bugs, and carries them around in a zip lock baggy to show anyone who will listen. This was a great gift, a big hit, and I would definitely recommend. Amazon also sells refill packs for the goop in different sizes and colors. You should be able to find refills for under $10."
0,1,"I have played this game for almost 20 years now and I have to say, it has never gotten boring. It is just as fun to play today as it was 20 years ago. I love it. If you enjoy games that are slow, evenly paced, thoughtful, and strategic you will enjoy this game. There is some chance involved in the game, but overall, it is much more about what you play, when, where, and how. Get it."
0,1,....and provides plenty of scary moments when my 11 yr old is at the controls.  My wife HATES spiders and this just freaks her out whenever it shows up!  Revenge anyone??
1,0,"My son got this for his birthday, he has wanted one of these for a long time & he was SO excited when he received it!  But once we got it out of the box, his excitement quickly waned.  The spider would not move forward but only would turn in circles.  One of the buttons was defective.I contacted Uncle Milton, told them that it was a gift & we have no receipt.  But they insisted I ""return it to the store it was purchased at"" with no other option.  So, I guess we are stuck with a toy that doesn't work...what a shame!  This isn't the first thing I have purchased from Uncle Milton that didn't work...buyer beware!  I feel really bad because the gift was bought by his friend who is going to ask about the toy eventually.  He gave it to my son with the intention of him loving the toy & could not have picked a more appropriate toy for my son!  What a let down :("
0,1,"This thing is pretty cool. My kid likes everything outer space so we hung this up in his room. It is a great nightlight and even has the option to shut itself off after a certain amount of time to save the battery. Adding a remote for it was a great idea as well, because you do not have to take it down every time you want to turn it on. If your kid (or you) like space or have a spaced themed area of the room/house, you should grab this. It has great detail and shadowing as well, giving it the appearance of a real moon, craters and all."
0,1,"Great night light while it lasted (about a year). After that, the LED died and so did the moon. Tood bad."
0,1,"We love this nightlight. My son is 11 months old, and he loves the remote control that changes the phase of the moon! If your child is accustomed to sleeping in total/relative darkness, don't keep this close to his face, but on an opposite wall, it's perfect."
0,1,"I am incredibly disappointed with this product.  The moon worked great when we first set it up.  My 5 and 4 year olds loved using the remote to change the moon from full moon to half moon.  We enjoyed how the moon would automatically turn on when it became dark.Everything was great until a week later when the moon stopped working.  The batteries had died within a week.The moon looked cute up on the wall even though it wasn't lit up, so I left it as it was for a while.  After a couple of months I decided to try replacing the batteries and see if it would work.After putting in brand new AA batteries, it did not light up.  A few hours later it came on.  We put the moon up on the wall and again enjoyed having it turn on when it became night.  Within a week, the batteries were dead, again.I called up Uncle Milton, the company who makes the Moon in My Room, and they informed me that the batteries dying in less than a week is normal if you keep the moon in the on position.  I explained to them that the instructions never mention having to turn the moon off every night as it already has an auto shut-off.  She said even with the auto shut-off on the moon, it is normal for the batteries to only last a few days.For the batteries to work longer than a week, you have to turn the switch on the back side of the moon.  We keep our moon on the wall up high to look like a moon, so turning the switch on the backside is completely impractical.  There is no on/off switch on the remote to turn the auto sensor off, so the only way to turn the switch is taking it off the wall.Overall this moon is not worth over $10 to use as a decoration if you can't keep it lit up for more than a week.  The money I spent on the batteries to keep the moon lit for such a short time was a complete waste.  If I could do things over, I never would have purchased this product and I will not be recommending it.  Save your money for something else."
0,1,We love this moon.  It will be hanging on the wall in my son's space room.  We set the moon phase at night just like the real one.  It looks great and everyone that has seen it really enjoys it.
0,1,"We bought one of these for each our 5 year old boy and our 3 year old girl.  This toy is really cool.  It hangs easily, has a remote control that works well and a few different settings that make it pretty neat.  Its a perfect night light and great for a child to look at when they are trying to fall asleep.  I would definitely recommend it."
0,1,"Two girls 3 and 4 love the moon, thought this would be educational and indeed it is!  We have all enjoyed it and they were interested in it so much that we now look everyday to check that we have the right phase, and even I have learned the phases. Very cool!"
0,1,My 3 year old son absolutely loves his moon.  He likes to take the remote control to bed with him and move the phases of the moon himself.
0,1,This toy was purchased for my grandson's 5th birthday. At first he didn't know what to do with it. Once it was taken out of the wrapping and explained he took it into the bathroom (only dark room at that time of the day) and saw it lite up. He made sure everyone had a chance to go in and see it work. He loved it. It is in his room and he turns it  on every night.It is not a toy that is played with all the time but more of an educational toy that he learns with and has fun with it.It was shipped and arrived when promised. Very happy with this purchase.
0,1,We returned this.  My son loves astronomy but not enough to want to hang up a moon in his room.  It didn't quite appeal to my pre teen.  I would recommend this for a child under 12.
0,1,Buying this product through Amazon saved me $15 from a local store.  It does exactly what its suppose to.  Have had it for a month and use it every night.  I love the built in timer that shuts it off after 10 minutes.  Worth buying.
0,1,Bought this as a night light for my toddler. She loves it and plays with it all the time. I highly recommend to anyone with small kids.
0,1,"Who needs an ordinary night light when you can have the moon in your bedroom or children's room?That's what we thought when we first hung and turned this thing on.It's been used as the ultimate sleeping aid for a wild 3 year for months now, and it works well.The two best things I like about it:- It has great detail in it's design. You truly see the moon come out when turning it on in a dark room.- It has a great auto-shutoff feature (set at 30 minutes) to save battery life.The one pet peeve I have about it:- The lighting could have been made better. When the moon switches from 1/4 - 2/4 - 3/4 - full moon, the separate sections are visible, which throws me a bit off. It's really not a big deal, but may annoy those who pay very close attention to detail.Overall, It is a great addition to our bedroom. And I highly recommend it for any parent or even for someone who is looking to add an interesting piece of decor to their home."
0,1,"I was really looking forward to this product because it really looked cool and from the labeling on the outside of the box, it seemed as if this product / science based toy did a lot more than was suggested. Let me just break down what's wrong with this point by point so there's no confusion.1. This Moon does NOT automatically phase at all. You have to manually click through it and the stages are in sharp contrast from each other.2. The Moon turns itself off after a very short period of time, negating the usefulness as a night light. There are no controls either to make a timing adjustment for preference.3. When using the remote you not only have to be incredibly close to it you have to point directly at it as it operates via line of sight and not RF. The range is very limited.4. This thing should be hooked up to the Atomic Clock like most other newer devices that read the moon phases. An incredible no brainer that would've been a cheap mod. Makes you really wonder about how cheap this thing really is.5. The batteries on this are incredibly ridiculous. Really? 4 AA's for 1 white LED? What kind of cheap Chinese circuitry did they put in this? Wiring from an off-brand 1940's Tube Television? C'mon, Uncle Milton.6. The number of faulty product reviews must be acknowledged, which only emphasizes my previous point. Typically, I never make any mention of this but it's just overwhelming here.Point blank ... the last thing I want is ""Uncle Milton"" in my room, his moon, included."
0,1,"Purchased 2 of these for my 3 yr old and 9 yr old boys...  They are super easy to set up, install batteries and hang it like a picture.. They are bright and look great ... The auto shut off feature is a nice plus since they run on batteries.. 30m and off... If you child loves night lights or proj. mobiles like my children do, then this is a nice addition....."
1,0,"We have owned this plane for almost a year now and my daughter, who is 2 1/2, has played with it A LOT!  She used to just push it along on the floor, but now she makes it 'fly', loads the people and luggage in and out and acts out little conversations between the passengers.  Really cute and totally worth the $$,"
1,0,"Durable, well made and it has already taken a beating at the hands of our 2 year old Grandson.  He has enjoyed playing with it since he got it for his birthday."
0,1,"There is no off switch to this toy. Granted it takes pushing down on the person to get it to make noise, but still, every toy needs an off switch!There are much more interesting toys available, but the one thing we like about it (for our 1 year old) is that it has a handle for him to carry with him."
0,1,"I bought this for a friend's kid.  Their son likes Fischer-Price Little People, this seemed like a nice set, but what do I know?  Seriously, I really don't know kids toys.  I don't have a kid, I can't remember being this young, and I can't relate.  Whatever.It seemed like Aiden was having a good time with it, and it seemed pretty durable.  And then he threw it.  Now, in the mind of a child, I'm sure it seems that this plane could fly.  Let me assure you that it doesn't.  As a perfect metaphor for life, the airplane soared just long enough to give credibility to his imagination and dreams before it swiftly and cruelly came crashing to the ground in a screaming fit of reality.  As the plane crashed to the earth, I found myself smiling, fully understanding the value of this toy for the first time.  Watching the Little People tumble out of the cabin and cascade across the lawn just added to schadenfreude I was enjoying and caused me to break out in a fit of laughter.It's the perfectly subversive toy.  It will delight your kids even as it teaches them to stay grounded and realize that life is not all it appears to be and that there will always be someone bigger than you that is laughing out loud at your misfortune.The cynic in me couldn't have planned it better."
0,1,Bought this as a gift for a two year old..she absolutely loved it and plays with it all the time!  Its a toy that is durable and interactive...  Would buy from seller again!
1,0,My son loves this plane. He has so much fun playing with it. . . . . . . .
1,0,My 3 year old son loves airplanes.  This is adorable.  The little people inside move up and down and you push it along the floor or activity table.  The sounds are cute and I liked the handle that can be easily used by a 3 year old when he is pretending to fly his plane.  Great buy...durable...good quality.
1,0,my niece loved the gift the fisher-Price LIttle People with moveable parts. great that thee is additional people that can be brought separately
0,1,"I purchased this toy for my 15 month old.  It was a big hit for all my children especially my 3 year old and 15 month old.  They love to listen to the songs and watch the letters pop up on the screen.  It plays several children songs like ABC, Old MacDonald, Take Me Out to the Ballgame...They are all singing along with it.  I recommend this toy to all families with small children who love music."
0,1,"My two children both love to be in the kitchen with me while I am cooking, doing dishes, cleaning up, etc.  This toy is a great way to keep them occupied and entertained while I am doing these chores. They have had it over a year and still play with it frequently.  It has cute songs that teach the alphabet and numbers.  I recommend it."
0,1,"We were visiting someone when my two year old first discovered this toy.  We couldn't get her off of it when it was time to leave.  The zebra seems very durable, she jumps and bounces on it like crazy.  The only problem we had was about an hour after we got it the sound stopped working, but Fisher Price is great and sent a replacement out immediately at no cost to us.  It was super easy to assemble and took less than five minutes.  I never would have thought to get this for her since she was already two but after owning one I would say it is great for a 1-3 year old."
1,0,"Spent a fortune on this thing, and truly regret it. Kids have not been the least interested in this toy, and honestly, it did not deliver. Seems pretty cheap to me, and sounds are pretty annoying"
0,1,"My nearly 8 month old daughter, while too small to use the toy on her own, absolutely adores her bouncy zebra. She sits next to the zebra and spins the little animals setting off the sound and lights. She also loves it when I hold her in the seat and bounce her. As soon as she can get up there herself I'm sure she'll be bouncing non-stop.  The manufacturer recommends this toy for 1-3 year olds, but that would have to be a tiny 3 year old. At 8 months my baby's feet nearly touch and she'll probably be able to use it on her own in another month or two. This toy is a bit expensive (at least here), but I found it used at a children's store. It's a pretty popular toy, so I always see a couple there for cheap.Update: Now my daughter is 18 months old and we're still getting plenty of use out of her bouncy zebra.  She's been getting up on it and bouncing by herself for several months now and she probably plays with it at least once a day. This really is a must have baby/toddler toy."
0,1,"My 13 month old got this as a Christmas gift and she LOVES it. My 3 year old also loves it. I deducted a star because the music is VERY annoying and the toy is super sensitive- i.e. the slightest bump and the music starts going off. This is not a small toy, but if you're like us...going from a big swing, jumperoo, and activity center to just a zebra...it's not a big deal. The zebra is also super cute...the girls love to hug him."
1,0,"We got this for our son's first birthday, and at first he wasn't interested in it at all. However, now we're at 14 months old and he tries to get on himself - once we help him on it, he loves to bounce and make the music play!"
0,1,"We got this as a gift for our first child's 1st birthday. We now have four kids and they all use this zebra.From a safety perspective, at first, I was worried that a kid would fall off this but that has never happened. These kids hang on tight! What I realize now is that for some kids, especially my third child, they like to stand on the seat to ""ride"" it. So I recommend that for some children, you must pay attention and not leave them in the room alone with it.As I stated in the title, the other thing is that although they all hop on the zebra for a ride, none of them last very long on it before getting bored. They jump around on this for about a minute, maybe two tops, and then they're off to do something else.If I was a new parent with a limited budget and space, I think this is a decent toy but I would prefer toys likeEvenflo ExerSaucer Triple Fun - JungleorFisher-Price Laugh and Learn Jumperoosince my kids can last up to 30 minutes on them. All of these take up a big footprint so I'd want the toys that hold their interests the most."
1,0,"this was bought for my son's first birthday and he loved it. he has played with it so much since we bought it and so have various other children that have been in my home with a whole range of ages, the oldest being about 5.my daughter just turned one and she doesn't seem quite as into this toy as my son did but she still has plenty of time to change her mind. we have owned this toy for almost two years now and it has withstood all the use very well, it is quite durable and only took about 20 minutes to put together, if that.*update 07/04/2009My daughter is almost 22 months old and she absolutely loves this toy. I moved it into our mostly toy free living room a couple months ago and since then she has pretty much bounced (and spun) on this non-stop. My son, who is almost 4, still loves this toy. We've had it for almost 3 years now and it's holding up fine. This is a great toy to buy!*update 12/04/2012So glad we bought this! Our third child, who is 15 months, has just recently taken an interest in this toy. That's 3 kids who've loved it and I am quite pleased with the fact that we've had this toy for over 6 years now and it's still going strong. Nothing on it has broke, the battery operated sounds still work, & it still bounces and spins just fine. Best toy investment ever!"
0,1,I bought this for my 1 y/o godson and his twin sister. They both love playing with it when supervised. My godson who is learning to walk occasionally uses it as a walker so it can be a little dangerous.
1,0,"This toy has so many reviews, it doesn't really need another one.  But, I felt compelled because this is my son's absolute favorite toy from all of the ones he received for Christmas.  He loves bouncing and rocking on this thing.  Now that he's had it for a few days, he can easily get on and off by himself.  My only minor complaint - at 14 months, his toes just barely touch the green platform (he's 90th percentile for height)."
0,1,"We bought this for my daughter when she turned one.  She is now 17 months and still uses it.  In the beginning, her legs were too short to touch the base, but she still liked to sit on it and we would spin it and bounce it for her.  Now she can spin and bounce herself.  She enjoys sitting on it to watch her videos, and sometimes stands on it, with no hands!  It seemed to improve her balance a lot, and her walking was a lot more steady.  There were times that she hardly touched it, but then other times, she just can't get enough!  She did fall off a few times, but no injuries were sustained.  She also likes to look into the zebra's face and sometimes kisses it on the nose.I think this toy really helped her balance and walk well.  She is also able to climb on and off other ride on type toys with ease since getting this toy.  The music is just the right volume for her."
0,1,"We bought this for our baby's first birthday. It has been three months now and she has used it every single day!! Once she learned to get on it (she figured it out the first day) - she was riding away. It is also very amusing to watch, so everyone is entertained with this toy. When I looked at the box - I was worried about it tipping, but that has not happened and I do not see how it could. The base is heavy and wide, yet it does not take up alot of room. If you have a baby who is very active  - I highly recommend this Zebra."
0,1,"This classic toy from Fisher-Price will likely delight kids 7 or 8 months and older. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my first-born when he was 7 months old and he got hooked on it right from the beginning. It moves and it sings. The ""come aboard the anmial train"" song can get tiresome to an adult quickly, but apparently kids don't mind, which is good. There're actually not many ways to play this toy, and it has very limited to no educational value, but I have to admit it's a fun toy for babies and toddlers."
0,1,"I love these animals! They are so cute, and they make click noises when you move their legs. The feet of the animals a different colors with shapes on them, so you can easily include an educational edge to your child's playtime with these lovely toys. The train is also nice, bit I can't stand the noises it makes or the voice of the person singing, so i turn the sound off and let my child make their own noises. These toys seem very durable and well made."
0,1,"Fisher-Price Amazing Animals Sing & Go Choo-ChooMy granddaughter (10 mo) has as much fun pushing this choo choo as watching it run on it's own. She graps hold of the monkey's bar in back and pushes (it makes a nice handle). She experiments with moving all the animal parts in every which way. She also takes the train apart but hasn't started putting it back together yet.  There are a lot of toys here, all the legs are moveable, as well as the elephant's trunk and ears. The monkey rattles. Music and lights too!"
0,1,My daughter and all her buddies LOVE this train. It is a fantastic gift for any kiddo - boy or girl. I noticed that the price is way up from when we got it at Christmas time. We paid around $30 for it and I thought we got a lot of bang for our buck but I think if I paid more than $50 I would feel like it wasn't a good deal.
0,1,Our darling son got this as a gift for the holidays and he loves it. I love the fact that it teaches him about the animals & the noises they make. I also love the fact that it actually moves.
0,1,"I bought this after my 18 mo. old couldn't get enough of one she encountered on a playdate. I am not one for the electronic toys with lights and sounds and we do plan to get her a real piano. However, this one has several different modes of play that keep her, and every kid that comes to our house, entertained for a while."
1,0,"This was for our grandaughter, newly adopted from Guatemala.  We chose it because of all the sensory things it does..and we were not disappointed!!  It's a really fun toy, very interactive, lots of lights and sounds!  We'd buy it in a minute again!!  This is a winner and just right for little people!  Besides that..it's Fisher-Price!"
0,1,This was one of the first laugh & learn type toys. We bought it for our (now 5) little girl at around 12 months. It was by far her favorite toy for years. It lasted through my son and now my 18 month old plays with it daily. It has held up great and keeps everyones attention. It is for sure a toy that will have playing power that lasts more than a few months.We never once had any pinching issues. It never tipped over or well we didnt have any issues with it.
0,1,"Fisher Price Grand Piano has the keys light up, has different modes for music, learning (numbers 1-8, colors, pitch, and rhythm), also you can play the piano by tapping the individual keys.We don't have a problem with her pinching her hands yet and she has played with it everyday for almost 4 months (it is her favorite toy).I give this piano four stars because the sharps and flats (black keys on a piano) don't work."
0,1,"Our baby loves music and adores this toy.  It has lots of buttons, switches and levers to operate, keys to press and ""pages"" to flip to hear other music.  It has teaching modes (numbers, colors, notes), a song playing mode, and a ""free play"" mode that reproduces musical notes on the keyboard.  The toy can reproduce several notes at once, so if you play a bit of piano you can play songs for baby (no ""black keys"" though) and let him bash along with you with no harm done.We got the ""Baby Grand"" when our baby was about six months old, and he still plays with it (though not as much) at a bit over a year old.  If you know baby toys at all you know this is a fantastic return on investment. He knows his favorites and returns to them again, and again (and again - you'll come to know all the songs very well).The toy is well made, and takes up less space than you would think.  The singing is far from the most cloying I've heard on children's toys. The toy is pretty stable on the ground, so baby can pull up on it.  Another reviewer mentioned the #4 key sticking, and ours does too, not a huge deal."
0,1,"This is very different, helps with learning technology of ATM's, at beginning you have to set up the ATM, the time, date, alarms, and have to assign a password.  When you insert you money, it keeps count, and if you are saving for certain items, it helps establish how much more you need to make your goal purchase.  It teaches with deposits and withdrawals, and budget for your items."
0,1,"My 6 year old likes this ATM and has fun knowing how much money he has in it.  I searched this type of product online and not many of them had good reviews.  So maybe this is the best there is for a kids' toy.Be warned, however, that it doesn't hold a LOT of money (in coins, anyway.)  The money is all stored behind that rectangular door at the bottom which is only about half as deep as the machine itself.  When you get very many coins in there, the next time you open the door to make a ""withdrawal"" (you open the door, take some out, then type in the amount of you removed), they all come spilling out before you can shut the door again.  It would be great if the money was sorted somehow or dropped into a place that would not fall out.Also, this machine does not count $2 bills.It's fun, but not very impressive."
0,1,"Great game,  good box, and pieces. bad directions for someone who has never played the game. Thank goodness for the internet."
0,1,My 6 year old son would love taking my digital camera and taking all sorts of pictures with it.  All the while I would be a nervous wreak thinking he would drop it.  Just like the Daniel on the commerical my Daniel isn't the most careful.  So when his God mother got this for him for his birthday I was very surprised to see how great it really is.  I download the pictures I want to keep that he takes onto the computer and then print them right up.  It's great.  No more wasted 35mm and no more nervouseness about my camera shattering into a million pieces.  Thanks Fisher Price!
0,1,"My daughter loves her wagon. She even likes to help pull or pushing it with mommy. I find it use it good, My daughter likes to sit in and also, there is plenty of room to put stuff so you are not caring it. You can adjust the seats so that they both face back also, the back seat can be transformed easily into a table or to cover the back half of the wagon as you use it as storage. The cover can easily removed or put back depending on weather or not you want to use it."
1,0,"We are a homeschooling family.  We bought this to use for our &#34;Fun Friday's&#34;  where we mostly play educational board games.  This is been very helpful for my 5th grader who is blessed with Dyslexia.  It helps by giving her a hands on approach to forming sentences.  We laugh about what we come up with, we do a little math to add up the score, and we get a lot of great quality time together.  A+"
0,1,"Based on the reviews, we purchased this game, but our family w/teens didn't find it sustained interest for long. Trying to build humorous sentences versus accurate sentences was part of the problem."
0,1,Well made and the nostalgic feeling of seeing this puppet were great. Very well made for the price and I told the recipient that it already was named for her.
0,1,The grandchildren have fun pretending with this set.  The microphone and calculator work great.  The cash register opens up with a bell sound.
0,1,I always wanted to learn how to do origami.  A friend of mine got me this.  I love it because you learn origami and get to add things like feathers.  Great for kids or adults.  Fun to do together.
0,1,"My daughter loved getting this for Christmas from ""Santa"". Great little starter kit for someone just learning to do Origami and kept her busy for hours!"
0,1,"This is actually a practical stuffed animal to get.  It's significant, impressive and cuddly.  It's big without being too big to wash.  My kids love it.The pose is good because it makes the wolf seem realistic."
0,1,"We got this as a gift for our nephew who's probably 6 or 7. I guess these animals are popular at there school because it's the only present he really wanted other than a play station 4. Since I'm not a millionaire and I have 15 other nieces and nephews, this gift was more in our price range.It doesn't sing talk or flash lights or lasers, it's simply a stuffed animal. Kind of refreshing though.It is very well made and appears to be constructed of high quality materials. The detail of the face is very realistic and the fur is soft. Not bristly or dull and matted like a lot of other animals my kids have or I have seen growing up.As far as stuffed animals goes, this is the Cadillac. Well done!!!!"
0,1,I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter who loves wolf's. Of all the gifts she says this was her favorite!!  I couldn't believe how nice this was for the money. He is so soft with realistic fur. Highly recommend.
0,1,"***2012 UPDATE***We still have this horsie, still love it, and it's in great condition after 4 years. However, I was distressed to read in other reviews that Radio Flyer has cheapened their product -- what I reviewed is not what you'll get if you order this. I hope buyers can track down the version we have!***END UPDATE***We bought this for our 15-month old daughter, though the product is recommended for slightly older children. If your child is running and climbing pretty well, s/he is probably ready. Our daughter gets on and off the horse by herself and immediately mastered staying on and bouncing. Rocking back and forth took a few days. She loves it so much that I can tell her to ""go ride horsie"" when she's about to throw a fit, and she does!It required some serious but not too difficult assembly (horse's head piece weirdly evokes ""The Godfather""), and once it's put together it looks like a classic that will be passed down from generation to generation. The one we got had a slight dent in one of the leg pieces, but once assembled you couldn't tell.The sounds (""Home on the Range,"" clip clops, and whinnys) are charming, and after a month they haven't started to bug us yet. If they ever do, there's an off switch. The yarn hair on the tail and mane is a nice alternative to the usual plastic. My daughter loves to pet horsie. I found the horse's face and expression cuter than in the pictures. I can't recommend it enough -- looks great, loads of fun, we love it."
1,0,"I ordered this horse from different online store and was disappointed  to receive a horse that lacked many of the advertised features.  It had a  hard plastic saddle instead of authentic padded leather-like one, only one position stirrups instead of three, did not have integrated steps for easier mounting or stabilization cones on the base.  I called Radio Flyer and was told that they changed this model and the one I received was the new version.  On my question why they changed it to a lower quality product they said it was the company decision.  I ended up returning it and found the good one.  I would like to warn all of you reading these glowing reviews that most of the reviewers have the older version with many nice features.  If these features are important to you, please make sure you are getting the right version and spare yourself from disappointment and hassle of returning it.  It is a shame that such a good company like Radio Flyer would do something like that."
0,1,The telescoping doesn't work all that well unless the crayons are spaced out perfectly.  Tell that to a 8 year old.  He doesn't care and just leaves it up.  Loves the colors though.
0,1,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It was such a good buy! It sits really sturdy on the table, doesn't tip or slide and has a great assortment of colors. I would buy it again!"
0,1,"The crayons are all that we have come to expect from Crayola, and this tower is fun and fantastic for storage.  So much better than the cardboard boxes.  Congratulations, Crayola!"
1,0,"This is very well made and so cute.  Oscar's can even has a little handle on top that my son uses to carry him around. It is not quiet as soft and cuddly as the other characters in the collection (due to the texture of the fabric on the can), but the collection wouldn't be complete with out him. I highly recommend this product."
0,1,We bought this for our 9 month old grandson; he loves anything Sesame Street!  He really has a lot of fun with this toy!
0,1,"daughter loved it from 1 to 2 yrs old, still sometimes pulls it out. Liked ernie and burt story time when I read to her at night. So got it to go with Erinie we got her, she loved it."
1,0,"I bought these as a present for the kids at last years family christmas party. They were a huge hit! They're easy to learn, and really inspire the kids to new heights."
0,1,"This Knex tub has lots of different things that can be made. The booklet has lots of ideas and is easy to put together. We made two things at a time with the amount of pieces and when we bought it, it was a great price. K'nex toys are a great toy for boys and girls of all ages."
1,0,"It's such a lovely easel otherwise, good quality wood frame and attractive. But come on people, I am SO SO SO disappointed nobody noted in reviews that for a hundred bucks, costing many times more than an Ikea easel, this one does not come with a real chalkboard! It's plastic. Chalk barely makes a mark on it. It is false advertising to sell this product as including a chalkboard when it is not at all a chalkboard, just made to look like one. You can even see in the photo on Amazon for the product a child drawing on the chalkboard -- it's a lie. In reality chalk does not work like that at all on the faux-chalkboard. Perhaps the model changed and Amazon still lists it under the same item. Which is something I have seen Amazon do on other items too, which misrepresents the true feedback for the item in stock. I would return this but I had to tear apart the box to get the huge pieces out of it and I didn't know the chalkboard wasn't real until the whole thing was assembled and I tried to draw on it with chalk. Boo boo boo at KidKraft for making an easel like this!!!"
0,1,"This is a high quality easel, I like that both my children can play at the same time, the try underneath is wonderful."
0,1,"This isn't a thick and cushioned mat like I had expected. It is actually quite firm. The plastic cover doesn't seem like it will hold up with repeated use. Ours has a few small tears after just a month of use. There is also a hard (metal maybe) spot in one of the folds that can be felt through the cover. I'm concerned this might be a safety issue. We don't use it for tumbling or active play. It is mainly a place to sit on the floor for stories and cuddles. Love the idea of this mat, but execution fell very short.In case it isn't clear, this isn't a toy I can recommend unless the company does some serious improvements."
1,0,This set is WAY smaller than what I expected. It is smaller than most sets I have seen in the store. Very unhappy.
0,1,"I recently bought the kid craft vintage kitchen for my son so naturally I had to go all out and get him pots, pans, plates, fake food, and utensils.  This was perfect!  He plays with his kitchen almost everyday, and he loves to pretend like he is a chef making some scrumptious meal.  He mixes and stirs in imaginary ingredients and even tastes the spoon to see if it has enough flavor. It was important to get accessories for his kitchen that are not covered in paint that is full of lead.  This set is well made and I have peace of mind that with every spoonful he isn't also getting an unhealthy dose of poisonous lead."
1,0,"I got this for my daughters new kidcraft kitchen set, these pots and tools look and feel real and she loves playing with them."
0,1,"I purchased this pan set during an Amazon lightning deal for $10.40. My grandchildren will be getting a kitchen for Christmas. They have great imaginations & will love using this set for their pretend meals.Made of stainless steel, this set is very durable. The base of each pan is approx. 3.5"" in diameter. The depth of the pans range from 1"" to 1.5"". The cooking utensils range from approx. 4.5"" - 5.5"" long.There's two small potholders too. I didn't pull them out to measure them."
0,1,"We bought this early on in our Homeschool Days.  Several Mothers on Blogs where infatuated with it.  It was Sooo educational and FUN.YA! not so much.  There isnt that much to the game.  Okay ya you get some geography in, but it's about as much fun as sucking on a log.  I think there are more enjoyable game choices for that the Ticket to Ride Series (great maps with cities too) or even Pandemic (a Co-op Game).  They arent going to learn much from this game if they arent interested in it.  My 6-9-12 year old LOVE playing Ticket to Ride Europe.I thought it would have a bit more to the game as far as game play.  You just pick 10 tile and line them up on Tile Holders one for each of the Ten Days.  You can then do ONE of these things.  Swap one Day for another.  Pick up from the discard pile /discard one.  Or discard one and pick up from the New Tile Pile.  Then you try to link your days either by one country next to the other IE Germany to Poland,  OR you could FLY from Germany to Ireland.SAVE YOUR SELF some cash and just have your kids.... plan a make believe on Orbits or some travel site.  HECK they'd probably learn more!!.The ONLY reason it got a 3 is that they could have used cards but they used tiles.  They gave you a nice wooden tile board that has a very durable paint job.  Also the box, game board and component tray are very well constructed.  The artwork and map are colored well and the rule book was really well done-SHORT.It's just sitting on our shelf though.  Kids will gladly grab Ticket to Ride loooooong before they will go for this game.It's Dust Collector Game.... IF you are still looking at the game... PLEASE play it once before you buy it!!"
0,1,"Great game for the whole family. If you have the time this is the game to help your child learn Europe's geography and to have fun.  The game provides hours of fun and plus you do need a strategy while playing the game if you plan on winning. Basically it is 3 in 1, learning geography, fun, and strategy to win."
0,1,"---------------------------------------------------""Ten Days In Europe""---------------------------------------------------On the recommendation of the helpful folks at Dr. Comics & Mr. Games (my favorite local game shop) I picked up several of the geographically-oriented ""Ten Days"" games for my daughter... They have been a hit so far - although the official rules of play seemed a little too stringent at first, we have played several ""free"" games so far, planning itineraries at will, without using any of the game-play of strategy or luck -- I figured mostly we just wanted to get used to finding countries on the map, and have fun doing it. And thus far, mission accomplished. I would imagine that all the games in this series would also be great educational tools in a schoolhouse setting.A few comments about the Europe set:First off it's funny that, unlike the games for the other continents, this doesn't include train travel as one of the options, since in real life that is the main way to get around Europe.  But I guess if you tried to mimic the European rail system here, it would completely undercut the play elements of the game: you could easily get anywhere by train, so there would be no challenge in creating your itinerary.The geopolitics are interesting as well: both Russia and Turkey creep onto the board, as crypto-European as they are in real life. Greenland is nowhere to be seen, and a few island nations are given short shrift. Both Crete and Malta are colored in gray, the same as the looming African continent: strange that neither are considered European, although I guess in geologic terms, they are on a separate seismic plate than the rest of Europe, so perhaps the gamemakers were swayed by plate tectonics. Nevertheless, it's a bit odd that Crete is not presented as part of Greece, despite the Treaties of London and Lausanne. And isn't Malta an EU member? Similarly, the scope of the board's map doesn't span far enough East to include Cyprus, or for that matter the various nations along the Urals and Caucasus Mountains that have a fuzzy Eurasian-ness similar to Russia and Turkey: Armenia, Azerbaijan, et al. Oh, well.  Maybe next time. (They are represented in the Asian edition.) And don't get me started on The Isle Of Man!!More understandably, micro-states such as Andorra, Liechtenstein and the Republic of San Marino (as well as a few newer breakaway territories...) do not appear at all - reasonable overall, although they do show Andorra's borders, but shade it in with the same color as Spain.So, there's room for nitpicking. Nonetheless, this is a fine educational tool; within minutes, my daughter's grasp of the world's geography ballooned to new heights. Huzzah!  (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)"
0,1,"I brought this game camping with friends, and I broke it out and learned how to play it.  It is simple enough, you just have to remember that when you walk, you have to walk to connecting countries, and you must start your journey and end your journey with a country. Flying to countries, you have to have a corresponding color plane to match the two countries you are flying to and from.  My friends loved this game, and we plan on purchasing the other games.  This is educational because after a few games, you become more aware geographically where countries are.  My kids who are 7 and 9, caught on immediately and they like it too.  Asia will be my next purchase, and glad to see the Americas are now added!!  It is challenging because it forces you to think and change things as you go along, so many choices, so many ways."
0,1,"My 6-year-old daughter is really enjoying working on this - and whenever I get out my sewing kit to make a repair, she immediately gets hers and we are able to work together.  She is creating a stuffed animal and has done nearly all the work herself - requiring assistance with things like threading the needle and knotting an end."
0,1,My older niece has gotten into crafting.  She was quite exited to open this for Christmas this year.  I hope she completes it.
0,1,"Purchased for our daughter for christmas.  She has enjoyed working on it but has not yet completed it.  Seems that it is a bit more work tying all those knots than she thought it would be.  Also, difficult to get all of the knots uniform so that it doesn't bunch up in some areas.  This is not necessarily a fault of the kit, rather a challenge that would come with anything that requires knotting such as this does."
0,1,My 3 year old loves it.... He loves dump trucks right now. But like any toy he plays with it for one day then it sits for a week. Then he goes back to it. I like it it's perfect for a 2 - 4 year old. I think a 5 year old wouldn't like it as much.
1,0,"My 12 month old granddaughter loves this car.  She will crawl & push it all over the floor for quite a while.  Nothing else keeps her occupied like this car does!  It even rolls well on carpet.  I love that it is pink for girls!  They like to play with cars, too.  I think this will be one of her favorite toys for a long time."
1,0,"I love Melissa and Doug puzzles, and this one is great. My son loves to learn his letters through it, and the chunky pieces are great for his little fingers. The paint has chipped a little bit, but that's probably because they've ended up in his mouth one too many times. Great product!"
1,0,My 2 year old loves the colors and the animals that go along with each letter. I love the durability of this puzzle. Very well made.
0,1,"Melissa & Doug make a lot of great puzzles.  This one is also very well-made.Unlike some of their other chunky puzzles, the puzzle pieces are not painted.  Instead, the printed letters are glued to the pieces.  The glued paper hasn't peeled at all, though, and these pieces won't chip like the painted ones do.I gave this puzzle to my daughter at 22 months.  It wasn't too much of a challenge, and she absolutely loved it.  For each letter, there are pictures of two things that begin with that letter.  We often talk about the letters while she does the puzzle.Some pieces may be choking hazards for little ones, but it's otherwise a great toy for toddlers who love puzzles."
0,1,"This just came in the mail, and my 19 month old and I already love it.  The pieces are perfect for her hands; smoothly painted, durable, easy to hold, easy to remove and put back.  The pieces are painted the same as their spots on the board, and every letter is a different color combination, making the matching of the pieces in their places easy.  I'm very pleased with this purchase."
0,1,"My son just LOVES this toy! Right out of the box, he was running around the room making the propeller spin and diving down to rescue animals left in various states of jeopardy.  While the release mechanism doesn't really seem designed for his small three year old hands, he has no problem using the magnet to pick up his animals.  The pilot/vet included is also a nice touch, as it gives him a character with whom he can identify and make the hero of his little adventures.  The trigger mechanism to whirl the rotters works just fine and the whole things designed for durability.  No doubt about it, this is a keeper and sure to get lots of attention around our house."
1,0,"I love these toys and wish they were more available here in the US. They are fun, durable, cute and made well. My son has the camper and this and he loves them both."
0,1,"I love this toy and so does my tot.  As a parent, I love it because it's simple but engaging fun without requiring batteries.  The magnetic feature allows you to ""rescue"" animals and by turning the search light you can drop them off.  This takes coordination and skills.  You can also make the helicopter blades and it makes sounds like a rotor.  My 2 year old has stuck his hands in the ""blades"" while we were making them spin and they are very gentle, does not hurt at all.  I think this is a toy my child can grow with and it is great that it does not even require batteries like so many toys."
0,1,"So the product description on the box says this is for ages 1-5.  In actuality, this is probably great for the 2-3 set, but a little too young for the 4-5 set.The Copter is very well made and is of durable, colorful plastic.  Each animal as a little magnet on it that attaches to the magnet on the Copter.  There's a little trigger on the bottom of the Copter that activates the rotors, making them spin and whir.It comes with three animals and one rescue vet.  The animals are cute and each sports a visible bandage or cast showing where they need to be treated.Fantastic for Imaginative play!"
0,1,"my daughter loves calico critters and this was a fun addition for her. it comes w/cute litte accessories and a fun little balloon they can ride in. my only complaint, with all calico critters products, is the absurd price tag for a little plastic house, made in china. ridiculous. but again, my daughter loves it, its cute and it came quickly and packaged well. best price we found was on amazon, as usual."
0,1,"This simple, cheap toy has given us hours of fun!  Kids love to play with this, but so do adults!  Makes a great gift!"
0,1,"This garage was so easy to put together (it did not require screws or the ability to read poor assembly instructions), and the plastic is pretty solid, not flimsy. The cars are chunky enough for small toddler hands. The interactivity is just right -- not too much, not too little: there are no annoying saccharine high-pitch voiced songs. Other toys cars we have also fit this garage, another plus because you can really expand this garage into a parking lot!For what it does, the price is unfortunately steep. The right price should have been $30. Also quirky is that the toy does not include a helicopter for the helipad on top of the garage.Last but not least, it is so true that this garage is easily dismantled by a toddler. My son began to take it apart while stepping on it as a stool -- off came the ramp by accident, and from there it went downhill. He takes this garage apart at least once a day. That is the downside to idiot-proof assembly: toddler reverse-engineering. I guess you could look at that as an unintended toy benefit. Being able to take the garage apart has kept my child more interested in it!"
0,1,This is fun and seems to entertain the children for quite a while.  The quality is excellent and it will last a long time.
0,1,"So simple and fun even a little kid can get something out of it... but so potentially complex even I love to use it! Just look at the pics of all the cool things you can do and imagine all the fun stuff you could make as an adult. I got it for my 3 year old who is able to make shapes and is really trying hard to make good mazes with it, as well as other fun pictures. Obviously his work isn't great, but since he can use it now and I can also enjoy it now it seems like it will be a toy with great longevity. Fun and creative and works wonderfully/as advertised I would recommend it for any kid who likes arts and crafts and who is interested in doing something a little different from the same old stuff."
1,0,this item was nothing special. in fact the same item i did come across at a lesser price when i was out with my sister at the store. i do feel especially with the holidays right around the corner you need to offer more special deals to your current customers
0,1,"This expansion toCarcassonneis simple to learn, but changes the game in a pretty dramatic way. The box includes 18 new tiles (all with a tower base printed on them), wooden tower construction pieces, and a cardboard tower to use to stack unplayed tiles.The way the towers work is interesting. When a player places a tile with a tower base printed on it, he can either play on the tile's roads, cities, etc. as usual or place a tower building block on the tile. When he (let's call him Bob) places a tower block, he may remove a marker from an adjacent square belonging to an opponent (let's call her Alice) and hold it hostage. Bob will keep Alice's piece hostage until Alice captures one of Bob's pieces with a tower she builds.Players are not limited to placing tower blocks on the piece they just played. A tower block can be placed on any tower piece that has been played previously. As towers grow taller, the zone vulnerable to capture from that tower expands. A tower can be built to unlimited height, but if a player puts one of his or her colored game markers on top of the tower, it can no longer be added to.The tower concept really changes the strategy in the game. At any time, an opponent could draw a tower square, place it next to your uncompleted city, and steal your colored piece. Because of this constant risk of attack, it is often best to complete roads and cities early to lock in points. Also, playing right next to a tower piece is usually foolish, so the game surface tends to be more spread out than in the basic game.I do enjoy the tower expansion overall. It really makes you rethink your strategy for the game, which I think is always a good test for an expansion pack. That said, I think some of the other expansions (particularly theInns & CathedralsandTraders & Buildersexpansions) are better. Try those first."
0,1,"If you are looking for another expansion to cause strife in Carcassonne, this is it.  It is similar to fairy/dragon in that it gives you a way to remove opponents' meoples from the board.  It's fun, but my wife hates these types of expansions."
0,1,"This toy has been recalled! [...] It poses a strangulation hazard to children, they can be caught between the table and the seat...without proper (constant) supervision, this toy could turn deadly. Beware."
1,0,I am addicted to Melissa & Doug puzzles. They are the ONLY puzzles I buy for my grandchildren...Last forever and given from one child to the next....
1,0,"My 18 month old loves these puzzles! They are very well made, colorful and cute. He isn't a ""teether"" but he does occasionally put the pieces in his mouth, it hasn't bothered them at all. They are worth the price"
0,1,These puzzles are great! Great for toddlers to grip and the puzzles themselves are nice and thick.  They arrived on time!
0,1,"I had a really difficult time deciding which garbage truck to buy: Bruder or Playmobil? I went back and forth, watched YouTube video reviews, and when the Bruder - which I really liked the appearance of - went on sale, I snapped it up. You can, for the record, get this at about 30% off from time to time, and I beleive it's worth the wait.This was a gift for my two-year old daughter. Both my two and four year old are mesmerized by the weekly garbage collection on our street. Lots of running to the windows, faces pressed against the glass and so on. So I knew this would be a big hit, and it was. I don't know which of my girls likes it better, and it was a struggle tearing my four year old away from it at naptime (the two year old took it with her and is happily singing and shuttling garbage to the main compartment as I type).The first thing that really struck me about this truck is just how incredibly large it is. There is a sticker on the top discouraging children from using it as a riding toy, and appropriately so; If I were three I'd hop right on and try to scoot myself around the house on it, which is precisely what my two year old did later on in the evening. It isn't broken from the abuse. Yet.Despite the large body, the cab is small-ish, about the right size for Playmobil people (the truck itself dwarfs our Playmobil figures and vehicles). The doors to the cab do not open, and while I should have paid more attention when ordering, I didn't and was thus disappointed in this. So were my daughters. That was one of the first things they looked for were doors to open on the cab.The rear of the truck has two little tabs which the two included rolly-cans can clip onto, and a lever with which to dump them. I fashioned some small trash bags to gift alongside the truck. Once the cans are emptied into the rear, the garbage is shuttled to the main compartment via two Archimedes screws which are operated by a crank on the side. These work fantastically when loaded with weighted garbage. For example, the girls have thrown away the marbles from thier marble run and the marbles are very efficiently moved to the main compartment. Playmobil accessories - like the bottles and cans from the kitchen set are great things to fill the trash cans with too. The lightweight garbage bags, however, will make their way back eventually but it's a bit less satisfying. The shreds of wrapping paper they tossed in there not only got stuck in the garbage cans, but just sort of sat atop the screw-devices getting fluffed about for the most part, much of the scraps refused to be pushed into the main compartment. So that's the first minor gripe.The second is that the trash cans, when loaded up with something heavy - like marbles - tend to come detached during the dump procedure, scattering marbles across the floor, and frustrating the children. Sometimes (tho less often) they will disengage even with a lighter load. We also bought the extra set of cans (three cans plus a dumpster) from Bruder. The dumpster is a bit annoying and tedious to attach to the provided red arms (these fold in for the smaller cans) and the dumpster *does not* stay attached when attempting to empty it into the truck. Which is a shame, becase the dumpster is pretty cool. These issues have led my children to pretty much abandon the trash cans (except for use as ladybug and beetle holders when outdoors) and instead they just cram trash and various other objects into the back of the truck by hand. They don't sense anything's amiss.So, while I probably would have demoted this truck to three stars based on those issues, they aren't *really* issues that effect the play value of this truck, just aesthetic gripes from a parent who feels she put some big $$$ down on this things and expected it to work seamlessly, and to some extent, effortlessly. The kids love the truck nonetheless, and because of that I don't regret buying it. Although if I had a do-over, I might give a closer look at the Playmobil variation. And I definitely would not buy the extra cans.I think that overall (assuming I can get them to stop filling the back with sand and seizing the Archimedes screw crank - this can be remedied by runnign water through it) this is a really durable truck. After all, it did support my daughter's 30 lbs... even though it claimed it couldn't do that. It's ABS plastic, what car bumpers are made of, so it shoudl in theory be tough -- and it just feels really solid. It's great looking, very realistic and detailed but not detailed to the point of being fragile and unplayable.Bottom line: Good toy, but perhaps not 'Great!' and German manufacturing is a plus. Even with its flaws, it's sure to be a hit with truck-loving kids."
0,1,"Ok, I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks that pretty much every single toy for kids plays music, lights up, etc. I have no problem with musical toys, but it's nice to have a quiet toy once in a while :) My daughter is 14 months and she enjoys playing with this. She loves taking off the top and putting various objects in it. She carries the animals all around the house and leaves them in various places. I always get a good laugh when I find a giraffe in the hamper! Another plus is that the toy is easy to clean!"
0,1,My daughters had this as little girls and I recently bought a set for my great-nephew's 1st birthday.  They are his favorite &#34;go-to&#34; toys.  He loves the little animals and doesn't want to leave the house without them.
0,1,"We had previously seen this at a friend's house, and my 2yr old has been showing interest in Little People, so we got it. It's solid, durable and comes with cute animals. Our daughter has a lot of fun playing ""pretend"" with the animals. It's very safe, no small pieces. I'd leave it with a younger child with little worry. The top comes off so you can clean inside the boat when needed. Our 4yr old likes it too. They've got the Little People Manger as well and this is a nice compliment to the figures in that set."
0,1,BUT be careful if using with younger kids or  non-communicative kids. The rubbery bands were fairly easily chewed off on some sections. My girl came and showed it to me and we discarded that piece and the rest was still fine to use. But I'd hate to think of a younger kid chewing it off and swallowing it.
1,0,I'm trying to stop a habit of scratching my head that gets really bad during my hour long commute.  This thing keeps my hands busy and it has a soothing rubbery texture that I really like.
0,1,"Well made, nice materials.Very therapeuthic.Great for relaxation and to help with focus.I use it more than my 4 year old with CP whom I bought it for."
1,0,"I purchased this for my son, who has Autism. I've found that little objects like this provide tactile and sensory stimulation while also encouraging fine motor skills (the pieces come apart in segments, and take dexterity to snap back in place). We give it to him to avoid restlessness, and to give him a small reinforcer to play with between therapy drills.This and items like it are inexpensive ways to work with your special needs child at home in between therapy sessions. Love this tangle item!"
0,1,"This item comes in pieces, and will never go back in place.  It lastest only a few hours of therapy.  don't waste your money"
0,1,"Got this to help my almost 2-year old daughter wind down at night. She cannot put herself to sleep and normally requires lots of physical touch to soothe her to sleep. She loves to hold this, twist it, and bite it, and will focus on this more intently than anything else we've ever tried at bed-time - one of the few things that has ever helped her fall asleep without needing my help. It has a great texture and has held up just fine from toddler abuse and biting. And when she's not using it, I enjoy fiddling with it myself. Fantastic little product!"
0,1,"Searching for something for my kidlet that both worked as a non-distracting fidget/focus toy and something that could stand up to a little gnawing in the place of fingernails or fingers lead me to the Tangle Therapy. The reviews here on Amazon helped me decide to give it a go.We had tried thinking putty, squeeze/stress balls, various stretchy things, pens, and so many other things - they either didn't click, or they were too distracting. The Tangle Therapy clicked right away. It went to school and it has stayed there b/c it works so well. I told her that if it ended up helping? We'd get several so that they was one at home, one that could stay at school, and a few for wherever they might be handy (cars, etc...) It took her all of 2 days to say &#34;when are we getting more?&#34;The thing is? I picked it up and didn't want to put it down either. One of those 'spares' might just have to become mom's.  This so rocks."
0,1,Purchased these thinking smaller fingers would be better with these but not the case.  Would not do again for the added cost.  Regular crayons are just fine.
0,1,nice....big and comfy .. though good for kids 2 or older. Got it for my 16 month old... he loved it then eat some of it.
1,0,"I got these today and was thrilled at their size, nice and actually jumbo unlike some crayons.  My son immediately wanted them as soon as he saw them and began to happily scribble on the nearest paper (table and floor too of course, lol).  He threw/dropped one already and unlike his other crayons, it didn't even dent.  A great set of crayons for any toddler, heck I even like coloring with them!"
0,1,Little one holds these as he loves to color and learn at home.
0,1,"This is the size you'll need for your one-year old.  They are strong enough to withstand the clumsiness of the beginning artist.  And don't even bother with any other brand; even toddlers get annoyed with waxy, uneven crayons.  Unfortunately, for some reason I had difficulty finding this size crayon in stores."
1,0,"They still get broken, but my two year old can use them without them snapping like most crayons do when a child colors with them."
0,1,"Love this product. It's held up well so far. The pegs are a thick plastic and have been chewed, stepped on, and thrown with no breakage or damage what so ever.The foam rubbery mat is sturdy as well and has been bent and played with a lot by both my 2 year old and my 5 and 7 year old little siblings when they visit.My only complaint is that the pegs are a bit hard to get apart for my DD's tiny hands(she's 2 but very petite and though strong these are tight!) once put together. I think they will probably loosen a bit as we play with them more. I would give another half star if I could."
0,1,"Ths product is good value. Made of good quality plastic and right weight for little hands to play with.  The pegboard is sturdy and thick. However, there is only one thing you can do with it. Stack them tall, just what it is named as. There is a list of suggested activities that you can do with the toy like sorting, pattern making, etc."
0,1,"Great educational toy. This was a great price on line and my grand daughter loves playing with it, She is 2 and it keeps her busy for a long time."
0,1,"Before I get into the challenge presented by this product, let me say that I am a long-time Checkers fanatic. I was first introduced to this game as a toddler, when I swallowed four checkers and had to have my stomach pumped. This terrifying ordeal forever linked ""Checkers"" and ""I'm no longer hungry"" in my psyche. To this day I can always comfort myself by snacking on a few checkermen. Being OCD and paranoid, I need comforting a LOT, so I purchase about 20 of these games a year. I'm an expert, folks.THIS game offers something found in no other Checkers set. THIS game has a board THAT DOES NOT FOLD. Hah, Mr. Checkers-Game-Maker! You are SO wrong...While consuming a few Checkermen, I devised my plan. For maximum creasiness, I first took an axe and skillfully thwacked a line down the center of the board. Warning: before you take this step, you should put your pet mouse Fuffikinoodles back in her cage. Ouch! Oh well, I don't have a tail and I get by just fine...Now that you have a nice deep crease in the middle of the board, it's a snap to fold. YOU'D THINK! BUT YOU'D BE WRONG!! Listen to the expert here.You want to FOLD your board, not break it in two. So before attempting the fold, cover the board in 4 yards of duct tape. Be sure to cover every inch front and back, with lots and lots of overlay. ""What's that lump?"". ""Where's Fuffikinoodles?"". Oops. Like I said, your little pets should be put back in their safe-places first.Once the board is completely stabilized by the duct tape, NOW you can fold it. Try to fold along the axe crease, and avoid folding directly over any lumps.VOILA! The challenge has been met. Pat yourself on the back. Then go to the pet store and find another mouse. Eat some checkers before you go - it's a dangerous world out there."
0,1,I donated this to a local hospital for people there.  I heard from the patience (sp) really enjoyed it.
1,0,"Love the magnetic board for traveling. The shapes are fun and include a good variety: arcs, bars, equilateral and scalene triangles, half circles, as well as your usuals. The weird rope idea is poorly done, though. A rope handle mounted at the top would have been much more useful and wouldn't take away board space. The holes in the board aren't terribly annoying if you're using letters or numbers, but it can get in the way when using shapes."
0,1,"I am writing another excellent review On Melissa & Doug's products! This time It is the Dress-up for Maggie Leigh ! The way these are made They are so easy to play with (especially their Little hands) It is so clever & although the Paper-Dolls in the Books that You cut out were Cheaper The also fall apart so quick! So Disappointing  :- (  ... These are great,You do not get the color coming out on their hands & It is Fun to watch Them as They use Their &#34;imaginations&#34;to change their outfits..I would make a small suggestion ! The boxes They come are in are not deep enough to store all the pieces in the sets.Even something like a child's size Shoes Box would work ! it's very easy for  little fingers to lose the plastic  cover You have Now!"
0,1,The paint job is excellent! I was impressed with the durable way they were made. I would say yes this is a good buy
1,0,The kids enjoy playing with these. The only complain I have is the box should be deeper so the outfits fit back in the box easier.
0,1,This puzzle is one of the harder M & D floor puzzles (which is what I was looking for).  It has 100 pieces where as many are 50 or fewer.  I have to agree with another reviewer that the picture of the puzzle is TINY on the side of the box.  The picture on the box cover is just a part of the picture.  Many M & D puzzles do that.  Older ones used to enclose a picture of the puzzle - kind of like a poster.  I wish they still did that.  One other small comment with this puzzle that I haven't experienced with other M & D puzzles is that 2 of the pieces of the interior puzzles have flat sides like an edge piece typically would.  Makes it a little tricky if you typically work from the outside in - but like I said we were looking for a little more difficult puzzle.
0,1,I teach Kindergarten and this puzzle takes my students a full lab rotation to complete! It's been working out really well in the classroom.
0,1,Had lots of fun with this in the pool this summer. Recommend it if you have a big pool and room for big toys.
0,1,"For what you get the Kelsyus Floating Lounger is pricey. I paid $8 for the King Kool Lounge and I&#8217;m not sure the Kelsyus Floating Lounger is any better. The test will be longevity. The kelsyus has fabric that goes over the inflatable areas that adds protection. Also, it&#8217;s designed so that you&#8217;re partially submerged in the water. That&#8217;s a positive or a negative depending upon what you&#8217;re looking for. Also, inflation is tricky because there&#8217;s no valve to keep the air from coming out as you&#8217;re inflating. When you&#8217;re not blowing you have to immediately stop the valve with your finger."
0,1,We like this set and it is good with helping teach my daughter language and thinking skills.  I do think that the foam pieces will not hold up long term and wish they were mor durable.
1,0,"My 2 and 4 year old boys love this toy.  They can be creative and use their imaginations to build differently each time they play with it.  It makes them think about how they are going to stack and build to ensure stability of the tower and platforms.  This toy is the best of both worlds, fun and educational."
0,1,The size of alphabets and numbers makes these suitable for my 18 month old daughter. This appeared to be biggest size available. These stick well on a magnetic whiteboard.
0,1,Lovely set of letters. I quite like the large size and the colors. I also agree that the magnets on the Ms and Ws could be stronger or maybe add another two so that they have better stick. Overall though I would recommend this product.
0,1,"The letters are good size and there a lot of them but i think the capital letters could use more magnets, they just don't stick to the magnetic wall we have, minus the capital letters are ok for kids to play with."
0,1,"I was super skeptical about this product and even more so when I saw the size of the jar.  We have been using the same jar for about a year because it makes so much snow.  It can be a little frustrating during clean up, but vacuuming works great."
1,0,Bought this for use in my preschool class the kids love this and a great alternative to real snow. Kids hands won't freeze and they can pack it into cups and pretend to build with it. Great feel to it as well. Down side doesn't last longer than a week or two before it starts to smell of mildew.
0,1,"Really debated whether these paint cups were needed...and the answer is Yes! They hold the paint, provide a paintbrush hole and they have a lid to keep the paints wet in between creations! They come in a sturdy cardboard holder which we appreciate because the easel we made did not have a holder."
1,0,These fit perfectly in the easel. Love the quality not cheap containers. Perfect size for little handsWould buy again
0,1,"I decided to buy finger paints to go with the easel that I bought for my granddaughter.  Needless to say, Mom was less than thrilled with that idea!  I saw these cups after I purchased the paints.  These are the perfect solution paired with the Melissa & Doug Jumbo Paint Brushes."
0,1,Bigger than they appear to be online--that's a plus! I love the spill proof lids! awesome invention! Stores the paints well! No complaints
1,0,These work well for holding paint and not spilling it. My daughter has learned to wipe off the excess paint on the inside of the cap which is less of a mess as well.
0,1,"We bought these paint cups along withMelissa & Doug Jumbo Paint Brushes (set of 4)for our daughter when she was 14 months old, and she loves painting with them! :) We never have any paint spills thanks to the design of the cups, and it makes cleanup so easy and quick! I like that they are different colors and match the colors of the paintbrushes - great for teaching kids about colors! We use these with edible vegetable-based paints (because our daughter is still young and occasionally puts the paint in her mouth), but I can see them working great with any kind of paint! We hope to get a lot of use out of these paint cups."
1,0,"I bought this with the Crayola Artista II Washable Tempera paints.The cups twist on and off.. and are easy to wash. The lids are great because if there is still pain in the cups when the kids are done, I simply put the lids on the cups, and I save the rest for later. The paint stays fresh for a few days, and I love the feeling of knowing that I didn't waste any of it :)The cups are strong, and I get the feeling like I'll be using them for a while. Great product.I recommend this product.Oh, and the kids already dropped the cups a few times.. Only once, did a few drops of paint come out, but it wasn't enough to make a huge mess.  The paint is washable, so I just grabbed a baby wipe, and cleaned off the drops from the hardwood floor and the table."
1,0,My 3 year old daughter fell in love with the Backyardigans.  She now has all five characters in several sizes.  These Ty mid-sized ones the winners.  They are well made - soft and cuddly.  They look accurately like the characters - really capture the charisma.  They are tough - take a beating and don't get out of shape.  They are the right size - child's forearm length.  They fit easily in the day bag - and get carried along - but not so small they get lost.  Perfect.  Fits the bill.  Enjoy.
0,1,estos mu&ntilde;ecos suaves y manejables..... son peque&ntilde;os pero actos para mi hija de 3 a&ntilde;os. muy lindos y de colores profundos. mi hija se vuelve loca cuando los ve. los recomiendo
0,1,"The children of the house have had an endless amount of good time with this particular plush, he is a favorite."
0,1,"I'm breaking out of my comfort zone here (I usually ONLY review books, movies and music) to review a toy I recently purchased for my daughter (this is the first of potentially 5 reviews).  My daughter (who is 2) is IN LOVE with Dora and Diego.  She already has a few Dora dolls (not to mention a bedspread) but I just couldn't resist these little Ty dolls.I actually really like the size.  She can stuff all five of her dolls in her Dora Backpack and take them around the house with her.  I won't let her sleep with Dora or Diego yet (as some have mentioned, the hair is kind of scary in that it looks like it could easily come out) but she has enough other dolls (Boots for one) to sleep with.Yes, I gave it only four stars on durability since the ware and tear of a toddler can do some damage.  Boots already is separating at the seams on his legs, so I had to get onto my little one for pulling at his legs.  No, his legs are not falling off, but I can tell that they are getting weak.  So, just watch your little ones to make sure they don't `love these little guys to death'.If your kids love Dora you can rest easy knowing that they will LOVE these dolls as well!And a note to parents, these toys are NOT educational; but the show is VERY much so (my kids speaks Spanish!  Like, OMG, I don't speak a word and she converses with me in Spanish at TWO YEARS OLD!!!)."
1,0,My child loved this plush toy and the quality and detail was very good.  You are definitely getting a good product here that will provide your child with hours of play time
0,1,"Great toy for anyone who likes Blues Clues, it's even infant approved!  Soft, durable, and easy to clean like other Beanie Babies.  It's the perfect size for little kids to drag around or cuddle with at bedtime! Thinking of picking upTy Periwinkle - Blues Cluestoo!"
0,1,My two year olds (twins) love this!  It's so cute and cuddly and makes them love Blues Clues even more!
0,1,"My son just turned 5 and is already a big Harry Potter fan. For his bday i got him a bunch of Harry Potter sutff and he absolutely loved this broom. Sure, it's made of plastic, but he didn't seem to care one bit. I think the only thing he was disappointed in was the fact that it didn't really fly. But after picking him up and flying him around the room a few times he didn't even seem to mind that. I haven't had any problems with bristles falling out or anything. Sure, i think it's a cheap piece of plastic that was nowhere near worth what i paid for it, but it made my son's day, and that's what was important."
1,0,I got this for a nephew I babysit and he loves it!  We ended up getting the race car though any of them would have been fine.  They're all adorable!  Personally I wish they made an adult sized pirate ship so I could join him!
0,1,My son loves these. Although they're smaller stamps they're still made with same quality that I've seen and expected from the Melissa and Doug brand. Durable and high quality. He loved them so much and I was so impressed that I ordered a bigger stamp set (Melissa & Doug) for him for Christmas. Recommend!
0,1,"The stamps are great.  Detailed enough to be realistic without being so detailed that the features bleed together when stamping.  Our ink pad was completely dried out though.  I'd still purchase because the stamps are a great quality, and you get enough to make a complete farm.  Just be forewarned that you may have a disappointed child if you don't have an extra ink pad laying around."
1,0,"When we were shopping for a birthday present for our 1 year old granddaughter, we were surprised at how substantial today's toy kitchens have become. We chose the Grow With Me because of its convertibility - small enough for her to use now, and expandable for when she's taller. No sense cluttering up landfills with too-small-too-early discarded toys. Corina loves playing with her kitchen, especially with the blender. It's sturdy, durable, and has no sharp corners or tight doors to scratch or  pinch little fingers. And her parents like the fact that all the accessories can stow away inside the oven. All in all, we're happy with this product."
0,1,"My nephew loved this toy!  He already likes Thomas, so he kept coming back to this toy after he opened his other birthday gifts.  Only problem was that we couldn't find an off button (his mom may hate me later for that!).  We got our giggles when it would make it's train noises every time we came to a stoplight and the toy shifted in the back seat."
0,1,I bought two of these flashlights for my two Thomas fans for Christmas.  They are a HUGE success with the kids.  I only give them four stars rather than five since the train sounds tend to drive me up the wall!
0,1,"This was the hit in my almost 3 year old son's Easter basket.  He loved it and didn't even care to check out what else he got once he had this.  He really is enjoying it and I have to admit, it really is cute."
1,0,Fits our flyer but seems a bit flimsy at time and bit costly.
1,0,"This item is fun and gives the kids shelter in the sun.  It does have clips which are somewhat flimsy, so don't use it in the wind."
0,1,Fit perfectly on wagon and easy to use.  A little low for kids view out.  Love it and will use regularly
0,1,"This is a great product for starting discussions, while at the dinner table or elsewhere.  It makes kids think about things they may not normally think about and gives parents a peek into their child's brain.  It is interesting to hear some of the responses my son comes up with.  It is also a convenient way to give your child a topic to write about for an essay or in a journal.  If they write about it, you can hold onto it and look back years from now and get a good laugh or cry.  A little bit expensive, but the plastic case is extremely sturdy and makes it look nice if you keep it at the dining table.  Also a good conversation starter with your spouse or an small friendly gathering.  A simple idea with a lot of uses!"
0,1,"so most of the games my kids' teacher recommended, can't be played (word sorts, word hide-and-seek, etc), since it's too confusing with words on both sides. Very annoying - I'd rather have paid more to get one word per card."
0,1,"We loathe constantly replacing batteries for our daughter's various toys and games. So we buy car chargers, electric chargers and rechargeable batteries for most things she uses often."
0,1,"Purchased a LeapFrog LeapPad for my grandson for Christmas. My daughter and I thought it would be a good idea to purchase the A/C adapter for it as well. Turns out we were right since he loves to play with it, and the adapter keeps it powered.  Saves money on batteries.The five-star ratings on this are more for the LeapPad than the adapter, but I included the ratings as part of the overall purchase."
0,1,This is a wonderful educational game.  It is challenging and gets the minds working and thinking.  It has a great book with it to help the kids with the patterns.  Easy to stick in a bag or suitcase if you are traveling.  Well made and easy for kids to learn how to follow steps.  My grandkids are 5 & 7 and they look at the pattern book and think what they have to do.  Very entertaining for their thinking minds.
1,0,"Only one player at a time - multiple levels of difficulty from very easy to darn near impossible.  Everyone in the family has enjoyed playing it at different times - the 9 year old does level 6, I'm stuck on level 4.  No matter how many times you play it - you don't remember how you solved a puzzle as there are several to choose from.  Love the compact case - great to stick in the purse and have the kids play with at restaurants while waiting for their food."
0,1,"This still sits in my drawer, I was going to put in a gift (you know, a little extra thing) but it's so cheap and embarrassing, I just can't give it to anyone and put my name on the card."
0,1,This is a cool alligator. It is about a foot long and has really great detail and coloring. Sort of wish the babies came off the back for more interaction ability...but then we would just lose them anyway. This toy is very durable and I do not foresee the thing could be destroyed without the use of intense heat.
0,1,"We have had this set now for over a year, and my boys just love it!They are now 4.5 and 5 (turning 6 in a month) and they just love their marble blocks.They always find so many ways to put them together, and they mix it with other blocks of theirs to build up different marble runs.I am amazed with what they come up with, and these really bring out their creativity!It is also very well made, which is very important to us.  This is a toy that will last many many years, and their own children will one day be able to play with it!"
0,1,"Sometimes you wish to be young again - really young, like two years old. We gave this trike as a birthday gift to my two year old son - the day was effectively over at that time, no interest in any cake, nor in all the other gifts (we told the grandparents a different story ...), nor in anything else. He absolutely loves it! He has not quite found out how to operate the pedals, so he moves it Flintstone-style, with his feet on the ground. Works like a charm. Good thing, that the seat is adjustable to five different distances from the pedals - we have it in the second notch now, which is perfect for him to reach the pedals.And his big sister (4 years old) actually loves to hitch a ride on the little step behind the seat - it is hilarious!The design is quite sound, I especially love the wide wheelbase, that prevents the trike from toppling over during normal operation (... well, sometimes it is operated rather un-normal ...). There are no sharp edges or pointy points sticking out, and assembly is a done in fifteen minutes.The overall quality is amazing - metal instead of plastic, I love it!Also, this was probably not intended to serve as such, but the seat has a small hole in the backside, where you can effectively grab the trike, or fix a rope to it, to prevent your little speedster from going away too far - which our young man will absolutely try, once he finds out what the pedals are for ...All in all, this is worth every cent - and makes me wish to be two again ... sometimes."
0,1,"As some other reviewers have mentioned, this bike has horrible chemical fumes. When I opened the box I was overwhelmed by the fumes. Even after putting the bike together (with my windows open) and storing the bike in the garage for 2 weeks to ""air out"", the bike still emits a strong chemical smell. The bike is obviously off-gasing chemicals in a similar way to a new car. I have noticed that the chemical smell is lessening over time but it is still strong. I will only allow my son to ride this bike outside and I will only store the bike outside or in the garage as a result. It is a shame that this bike emits such strong chemical fumes as it really is a beautiful and functional bike. The center of gravity is low, the bike is very stable and it moves well. My 21 month old son loves this trike. He does not pedal it yet but can ride it quite well by putting his feet on the ground and ""walking"" the bike forward. My son also can easily steer, turn and back up on this bike. I will keep the bike because of these qualities but I would recommend to only purchase this bike if you are going to only use/store it outside or if you can buy it and wait a long time for it to off-gas before using it indoors."
0,1,"My son got this for his 3rd birthday.  He was actually so in love with his new mini-kick scooter that it took a couple weeks for him to really want to ride this. He could definitely do it if he wanted - tall enough, strong enough, etc., but it wasn't until there were two little boys both wanting it at the same time, that hre really got into it. Very cute to see one little boy ride around with another standing on back (and gripping the handle of the seat).  It's a great toy for two kids to play on together - and then my son was into it and we would go for rides around the block.  He loves going down the driveways and practicing his turns and going back up another driveway.  Easy to maneuver.  Aerodynamic.  Safe.  Nice brake action and a definite guy magnet.  We call this the harley ;)  Super hot."
0,1,"Recently purchased the Schwinn Roadster for our grandson's 2nd birthday (coming up in a few weeks).  We read some great reviews when doing our ""homework,"" but we were not expecting such a gorgeous, well-made tricycle.  From its air-filled tires to its shiny red steel frame and chrome fenders, it's absolutely gorgeous.  The wheels turn easily & the bucket seat gives a lot of support.  It has a non-tip design, which many people cited in their reviews.  Easy to put together (Grandma did it!), and sturdy, sturdy, sturdy.  And that retro bell & streamers add just the right touch!  Can't wait to see our little guy's face!"
0,1,"I purchased the Schwinn tricycle for my children because of the very good reviews, solid construction, rubber tires (I was tired of the noisy plastic tire sound), and classic looks. Other than the tires, which have a tendency to deflate rather quickly (based on my observation, you would need to re-inflate the tires once a week or so), the tricycle is very sturdy. The difficulty comes with the pedaling motion. Both of my children have had difficulty with the tricycle because the mechanism is too tough for them to move. I am not sure if it is the low base, heaviness, or combination of the two that make it difficult to use. The wheels seem to turn fine when upside down. It worked ok for my kids when going downhill, but then I had to pull them back up the hill and that got old fast. My children did not have any problems with our Fisher-Price plastic tricycle. I should not that my children are small for their age. Still, I would have expected them to get some utility out of the tricycle. This tricycle may work well for some, but did not for us. I would say it is not nearly as universal in design as some other tricycles. I did not feel the need to trash the product with a one or two star rating, but it definitely has some deficiencies in design that may limit a child's ability to use the product."
0,1,"My 3 year old son loves this set! Its a perfect size for his age group, everything is easy to use. ""Fake"" wood parts are easy to put together, tools are very child friendly."
0,1,"This is a great product! When putting it together I couldn't find the screws. I called the company and without question, the sent me two screws in the mail.  They ended up being in the box under a flap, but the company's attitude towards the problem was GREAT!  Made in the USA!  That's a big plus in my book!  Love the ""wooden"" projects that come with it.  Hours of fun for my two kids.  Nice size, yet doesn't take up the whole room.  We currently have it in the living room and don't even notice it.  Very sturdy and very easy to put together.  About fifteen minutes, including the stickers.  Drawer is a little tough to pull in and out, but it is getting better and I think will be really nice the more it is used."
0,1,"Bought this for my 5 year old grandson for Christmas.  What upsets me is that the &#34;electric&#34; screw driver doesn't have much power.  If you are trying to build something using the &#34;wood&#34; pieces, you will need to use the regular screw driver.  The vice also doesn't tighten very well plus the drawer that holds the tools is very hard to pull out.  I had read that on other reviews, but I thought I could run a bar of soap over it to make it glide better.  Didn't work because everything is plastic.  I am also wondering what the saw is for.  Evidently just pretend.  Overall, I am disappointed."
1,0,"This little workshop has got to be one of the cutest toys!  I bought it for my daycare - but my 17 month old daughter loves playing with it too!  The screwdriver ""works"" with batteries, and it comes with several other tools.  I also love all of the foam ""wood"" pieces.  Although my daughter doesn't understand what to do with them, she still thoroughly enjoys playing with them.  She also really likes putting things in the pullout drawer.  Assembly is pretty quick - although the holes are not pre-drilled for the 4 big screws.  But pre-drilling them myself was no problem.The ONLY downfall is that the foam blocks don't stay together that well.  They can be put together, but are easily pulled apart through light playing.  But overall, I would not say that's a big deal.  I'm sure kids will enjoy playing with it no matter what!"
0,1,"My son loves the train set, and I like that there are a lot of pieces allowing for several configurations.  The bridges are not easy to use; they knock over very easily with the slightest bump, which is easy for a 2 year old to do.  We don't have a table, so maybe that would make the bridges more sturdy."
0,1,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE Melissa and Doug products. This train set is wonderful and such an amazing value. I am just sad that our Thomas the Train, diecast cars do NOT fit on the track. This track hooks up to the wooden set that we bought at Ikea. Based on others reviews, I thought that it would work with the Thomas the Train cars. We can still put them on the track, but the body of the cars are too narrow and so it's just not right. I did try one of our son's bigger plastic Thomas' and that fit just fine, but that's not the ones we were collecting :( We have the Learning Curve trains... Hopefully this review will help someone else from buying the track, if they only want it for a Thomas collection!"
0,1,"My two older kids love(d) this product.  They had so much fun zooming around our house on this.  Thinking we were done with kids, I let them zoom around outside and wow, they can get going really fast and get a good work out.  Fun to watch them.  I'm not sure if I can clean up the wheels well enough to let our 3rd zoom around the house.  Pretty durable for the price.  So glad they had this.  They both can ride bikes with out training wheels due to starting on this and then on a balance bike."
0,1,"The quality of this little scoot-about is great.  My grandson who is 18 months old has yet to master the maneuvering of this little bike, but I know that once he does, he's going to love it!  I would recommend the purchase of this item to anyone."
0,1,"I was lucky enough to find this scooter in great condition for about half the retail price at a consignment shop this afternoon.  I purchased it for my 12 month old son and planned to give it to him this Christmas when he will be almost 18 months.  Then I got home and started reading reviews here.  My son is 31"" long and about 23 lbs.  He just turned 1 less than a week ago.  From some of the reviews, it seemed like I had better give it to him now to use it to it's full potential, because people were saying their 2 year olds were too big for it, despite the manufacturer's 1-3 year age recommendation.  With my son being in the 90th percentile for height, I was worried he'd already be too big for it!I let him try it out before bed, and with the seat on the medium setting, he cannot quite sit on the seat and reach the handlebars comfortably.  With the seat on the highest setting, his feet barely reach the floor.  I think we have PLENTY of growing room with this scooter, and it should last him until he is ready for a tricycle at 2 or 3.  He had a great time walking it around the living room (he was not sitting on the seat) and trying to honk the horn that came with it, (not included in the retail box but an added extra by the family that owned it before us).  He liked the scooter a lot.  Time will tell if it becomes a favorite toy, but it is very cute, sturdy, well-made,  and just perfect for this age.  I think in 6 months when I originally wanted to give it to him, it will be an even better fit.  I think I will put it back in hiding and use it like I had originally intended.I just wanted to tell potential buyers not to worry that their 1 year old will be too big for it.  I think it would be fine for a tall 2-2.5 year old.My one gripe, and a small one, is that the bell seems to be difficult for my son to ring.  It's too hard for him to understand at 1 that he needs to pull the little rubber piece back and let it go.  I will be buying a better bell for it.Update 1-30-14My son still plays with his Scoot-About, but it just doesn't go as fast as he wants it to and he gets frustrated.  Now, the toy's main function is bell-ringing (and I never did replace the one it came with, he just figured it out).  He will occasionally sit on it, ring the bell, and get off.  When he tries to ride, he goes too fast and flips it over.  Once, he even flipped forward and flew over the handlebars!  For this reason, we are retiring the Scoot-About at 19 months and 34 inches tall (well below the manufacturer's recommended maximum age, and buying him a balance bike.  I think he will be better suited to something that can keep up with his level of strength and coordination.  I am keeping my review at four stars because I don't think all children have the coordination he has at this age and may be able to use it longer.I'm really glad I didn't wait until he was 18 months to give this to him, as I had originally intended.  He would have had little or no use of it."
1,0,"We've had this little scoot-about for a year, and my almost 2-year-old is now a pro at scooting himself about.  When he gets going fast, he'll pick his little feet up and put them on the surface between the two front wheels to ""coast."" He knows when the sidewalk is uneven, he has to stand up a little and lift the bike up to get it to go over the uneven surface.  I think it's given him a lot of confidence, and is, hopefully, good practice for a bike with pedals later.  It certainly is easy for small children to get on and off; the other kids at the playground always want to ride it.  This said, the steering is VERY limited, and the hard wheels aren't good for anything but smooth surfaces.  It's really a toy for small tots, and won't substitute for a tricycle, but we got a great deal on it at the pre-Christmas sale last year. It was totally worth the price for us."
0,1,My 2 year old granddaughter just loves this noisemaker! It's just her size and she can easily change the parts all by herself. I think it was her favourite toy from &#34;Santa&#34;.
1,0,"A great toy for any kid 3-6ish.  Buy in conjuntion with Tubations so there are enough tubes and couplers to make it fun.  It is amazing how many configurations kiddos come up with, using simple tubes and couplers.  Great to build motor skills, engineering, and imagination."
0,1,"Bought this for a new nephew. He's still tiny, but the bright colors have definitely attracted him, and the smooth/soft bodies make it safe enough for most toddlers."
0,1,"Our grandson loves these little trucks. He played with them on the beach where he filled them with sand and dumped the dump truck, etc. They are well constructed and held-up nicely to sand, dirt, tossing, and otherwise vrooming around at the mercy of a 20-month-old."
0,1,"The boys love the trucks, they have bright colors and look like they were built well.  The boys play with them all the time."
0,1,"My 2 year old son loves this toy. It is really cute and fun. He likes cutting the food and putting it back together.  He uses the bag to &#34;grocery shop&#34; around the house.  I like this a little more than the wooden foods that are similar because these are smaller and light weight and fit good in the little bag.  There are a lot of pieces to keep track of and they are kind of loud when they fall on the floor but I guess that's normal for kids toys.  The colors are not really bold, more subtle, but fine.  I think most kids would like this."
0,1,"My three year old loves cutting up and peeling these veggies. I am very thrilled with the quality and durability of these play food items. He has had so much fun peeling, chopping and serving up these veggies. The knife works great for chopping through the velcro attached to the veggies and makes a great &#34;crunch&#34; noise which really sounds like chopping through a veggie. The bag is pretty small so we keep them in a bigger bag with a cutting board I added to make it more fun. We use the bag for shopping instead which is also fun. I really thought I might like the wooden cutting sets better but I don't. Other friends of mine have the wooden fruits/veggies and they get really beat up and terrible looking after awhile. I'm very happy with this plastic set!!"
0,1,"This is one of the best play foods we have. The pieces fit together with velcro and the small (not sharp, not pointy) knife can ""cut"" through the various slices. The peas in pod and peelable banana are favorites for my 1 and 3 year-olds. Wonderful toy!"
0,1,I ordered this to make Bath Bombs.  It is perfect for that.  The size is about 2 inch diameter.  The price was good.  It would be hard to find in stores.  It was interesting that the package it was shipped in was all Chinese.  I saved the packaging just for the novelty of it.
0,1,they make lovely snow ball to play with. kids will enjoy without a doubt. great winter activity for them after snow.
1,0,"I received this product and can't wait to put it together for my 36 mo old and I to play with together. This is a toy that has great reviews and so far, I like what I see. I have yet to travel with it to bring it to my daughter to play with. She will be the ultimate reviewer after we put it together."
1,0,It's hard to find high quality toys anymore; just cheap plastic crap that breaks easily. The high quality plastic on this should last a long time.
1,0,This is a fantastic bulldozer.  It's heavy duty and makes for a great indoor or outdoor toy.  This bulldozer is detailed and any fan of trucks/construction equipment is sure to love it!
0,1,This is a very realistic looking toy. My son does like to play with it because the tracks don't work very well.
0,1,Perfect toy for our 3 year old grandson who loves these construction vehicles as he passes them on the highway.  He plays with them for hours.  They are very durable and affordable.
1,0,"My 2 1/2 year son loves. It's very tough plastic and cleans up easily when it gets dirty. Like I said, it's tough and takes the abuse a toddler will put it through. It's a good buy."
0,1,"My son and daughter both enjoy this toy. You can adjust the five buttons to make various changes in your voice. Most end up sounding like a squeaky robot. Would like this more, if it were specific affects with each button instead of just tuning your voice. Would make it more enjoyable."
0,1,"This is the best gift for little boys and girls to receive. They play with it constantly and of all the toys I gave them for Christmas, this is the one that was played/used most often."
1,0,"Grandson loves this toy!!  You can change your voice in 8 different ways using this toy.  Just set the levers and speak into the device.  Our grandson just turned 4 years old, and he loves it.  He's running around talking to everyone like a robot it is sooooooooo cute!!  If you are looking for something fun to buy a young child, this will be a great choice!!"
0,1,"Got it as a birthday present for my grandson. He spend hours playing with this. I don't know if he really liked it that much, or just enjoyed bugging us with it :). He had fun with it, that's all that matters.  Once he went off to chase the other kids, rather than the parents, it became a MUCH better choice as a present :) At least as a grandfather, I get to go home hahaha."
1,0,This is a fun toy. I can't make out the words they are saying but non the less they still have fun with it! It came in good condition and in a timely manner
1,0,"Santa brought this for my four year old daughter for Christmas and she still uses it everyday to annoy her little sister!!  The voice settings are all pretty similar, but she doesn't care.  A fun toy that is always a hit at playdates."
0,1,It broke down in the very first use. Just putting the batteries. I could not connect it. This is a waste of money.
0,1,when it came it had the batteries & the try me button & i did try it. it was so fun to use. as soon as my son unwrapped it he went wild with it. he loves being able to change his voice to them all but the robot is his favorite. this toy was the perfect birthday gift and at the price you can't go wrong.
0,1,"this toy is sort of cool but it is NOT easy to figure out....you have to slide the buttons up & down in various combinations to achieve the desired voice effect, so mostly it just sounds like a garbled megaphone .... It's OK for the price and maybe ideal for a smart kid who can manipulate the buttons better than my children who aren't gadget-savvy."
1,0,I must be mad to buy this but my kids love it and its a perfect Xmas present from Santa! Even the dads had fun playing with it. It entertained kids of ages 2 to 13yrs and was a hit.
0,1,My granddaughter loves this stroller.  It is made extremely well and is durable.  Not a flimsy thing.  Your little child will love pushing their stuffed animals and dolls all over the house.  Boys and girls love it.
0,1,"The whole family was entranced by this toy, from preschoolers to teenagers and even the adults. While it's essentially a solo game, a few more people can look on at the same time so they don't HAVE to wait for their own turn (though of course it's cooler to hold). It's a perfect self-contained game for travel.I was actually surprised at how effectively and how long it held the attention of many family members of various ages. I would have expected the appeal to be somewhat more limited, would have anticipated a lot more giving up on things that are hard to find, but instead everyone loved it and spent HOURS on it overall (not all at once, generally, but overall). Also, it's not entirely finished once you've found everything - you can still try again, especially if you haven't done it in a while (think one long car trip to the next?)I rated it well for educational value because I think it's great for developing visual discrimination. The same skill you use to spot a wing nut in a sea of pellets and stuff will be useful in life when you need to skim a textbook for the word ""Napoleon."" I also think, quite unscientifically, that it strengthens kids' attention - with no batteries or flashing lights."
1,0,I've always been a fan of Where's Waldo and other find it type games.  However with this it adds a new dimension.  Any time you move the container things shift so the items move.  It can be played by yourself or make it competitive with other people.  If you set a timer and take turns trying to find as many things as possible in the allotted time you can make a game of it!  It makes a great travel toy that can be thrown into a bag or the car to keep kids (or adults) entertained.
1,0,"my 4 year old loves Kirby after being introduced to Kirby's Epic Yarn game on the Wii, so he was begging for kirby toys, which are hard to find. This is perfect and he loves it.  The only thing is, I dont think it's really built all that tough to stand up to toddler play, as it got a hole or two in it not too long after we bought it, and it had to be stitched up. But it's still holding up well for the most part otherwise."
1,0,"The Easter Bunny left these in my children's baskets.  3 of my children struggle with sensory processing.  2 seek sensory input and one avoids sensory input.  They all love these toys and they are great for car rides!  The small size is perfect for small hands!  And it has a soothing or calming affect on my kiddos.  My older child just loves playing with it too and she has no sensory issues.  They have dropped it a few times, and so far no damage, but I am worried that one day they will crack the plastic cover.  Much better then the plastic needles.  Don't buy the ones with plastic, my kids take those apart in minutes.  These are a much better quality."
1,0,My husband and I got this game a while back. This is a good conversation starter game for couples not really a group game. You really have to be willing to hear things that you may not want to hear or say things that you really don't want to say. My husband and I have learned even more about each other with this game. Not really sexual just a get to know you game. I would say it would be a good game also for those that are in a relationship that you are serious about or want to be serious with to get to know each other.
0,1,"I had a lot of fun with this edition of the Conversation Cards.  The questions are thought provoking and can open up some very interesting dialogue between partners or in groups of couples.  Great for getting to know each other's values.Like any type of question and answer game you need to know your audience and use common sense.  If you are playing with your partner and one of you had an affair that the relationship is still recovering from then don't read the ""Have you ever cheated on a lover?"" card.  Some cards just aren't going to be up your alley but those are few and far between for most couples. This can be a really fun game as long as you don't insist on reading every card no matter who it's to or whose around.  If playing the gourmet food edition with a recovering alcoholic you wouldn't use the question about wine would you?"
0,1,These have started many great conversations between my husband and I.  The box is nicely substantial and very heavy.  We keep them on the shelf and pull one out a couple of times a week.  I highly recommend and have mentioned to friends and family how great they are.
1,0,I was really hoping there would be a good combo of the types of questions. They were mostly pretty 'deep' one's...not as fun as I had hoped!
0,1,"My gr.dtr.got this for Christmas and enjoys putting the shapes where they belong,and with the wooden pegs she can grab them easily with her little fingers."
0,1,"Pros: Wood construction and large knobs for your little one's hands to grasp. Cons: The colored portion of the shapes is made of paper, and easily starts tearing away if your child puts the shape in his or her mouth. Tisk, tisk, Melissa and Doug!"
1,0,"I usually love all the M and D puzzles. However, this one - while it's colorful, beautiful, exotic,... - also broke a piece while my grandson was playing with it the first time. Granted, he loves to destroy stuff, but usually the M and D puzzles hold up just fine. So I was surprised that this time it didn't. But he still loves to play with it."
0,1,This one doesnt have an image on the board to help and that makes it more interesting.  My little one loves it and cant get enough.
0,1,"My daughter loves puzzles, so we have dozens of them.  The Melissa & Doug puzzles are the nicest ones that we have found.The ""On the Farm"" jigsaw puzzle is a wooden puzzle with a wooden tray.  There is a paper image glued to the surface of the wood.The pieces of these puzzles are usually a little tight when you first open them, but they loosen up very quickly.  Some of them have small splinters when you first divide the pieces, but I just grab the splinters and pull them off.  We've never had any major quality issues with any of our Melissa & Doug puzzles."
0,1,My 2-year old loves this jigsaw puzzle and mastered it pretty quickly. Pieces are pretty big and fairly durable. Definitely recommend this.
0,1,"This is a great puzzle for a toddler that is learning about animals and also shapes and sorting. My 2.5 year old knows all about farm animals so we thought this would be a great starter puzzle. It definitely is!  We can talk about shapes, animal sounds, and colors while we fit the pieces together. We'll probably get more of them as I see they have other animals and themes."
0,1,"Not sure why people hated this game. I love it. Great final fantasy game. Looks and plays amazing. Not my favorite final fantasy, but in my top 5."
0,1,"Even if you don't like sushi, this toy is awesome.  No fish smell.  Durable toy for hours of fun the kids."
0,1,"This set is perfect for those children of foodies, kids who like to play diner/ restaurant or those who want to explore different cultures.My kids always loved to serve this set to me and my husband. We love the nice storage box. Sadly, the dog likes the wood these products are made with and we have lost a few pieces to knawing.All in all, I enjoy these sets and the sushi one is a favorite."
0,1,"My daughter loves playing with the sushi set. The chop sticks are pretty confusing for her to use, but I know adults that can't master them either so I'd say she's doing fine. The detail in this set is great. She likes cutting the sushi rolls, and I found it comical that the box plays off the velcro sound as it intentionally sounding like a roll being cut. There's plenty of mix and matching that can be done with the different bits and pieces. I'm not a fan of sushi, so even I found it interesting to take everything apart and see what all the different pieces were. I guess I'm still a kid at heart. As with other M&D toys, you can easily use the various pieces to teach colors and numbers. Everything is brightly painted, and the box it comes in neatly stores all the pieces which is a plus. It's a bit scary to look at a two year old holding a meat cleaver, but it gives me a chance to teach her to be careful with sharp things at a young age."
1,0,I teach mentally handicapped adults in a local community college.  A durable wooden puzzle like this one is a god send for me and my students.  I strongly recommend this puzzle if you want a durable puzzle that you can have your students work over and over again like I do.  Definitely worth getting.
0,1,I purchased this as a gift for a 2 year old.  Melissa and Doug never disappoint.  I have purchased many of their chunky puzzles and have loved them all.  The pieces are great for little hands and are very colorful.  Great for little kids.
0,1,"This is a great first puzzle for babies and young toddlers. The wooden knobs allow small hands to pick up pieces easily. However, the pictures of the animals start to lift from the puzzle pieces if chewed."
0,1,We had fun making the sounds of the animals and the vacant shapes allow wee ones to match up the shapes to put the pieces back.  A favorite.  recommend
0,1,This puzzle is NOT solid wood.  It is very OBVIOUSLY made with particle board.  It came full of saw dust too!  The pictures are laminated and my 1 year old daughter had put the pieces in her mouth a lot...as most 1 year olds do.  It is already peeling.  The poor quality makes me wonder what toxic chemicals she may have ingested.  Shame on M and D!
0,1,Melissa and Doug products are a great buy. Good quality and this product matches up with the description perfectly. A must buy
0,1,"This puzzle was originally purchased for my first child but his little sister has gotten FAR more use out of it.  I will say that if your child puts the pieces in their mouth, the pictures will rub off pretty easily.  My daughter loves animals and making the sounds and this is her FAVORITE puzzle out of the huge collection we have."
0,1,"Melissa and Doug know their stuff! This puzzle is very thick and durable. I love the jumbo knobs for my little guy to hold on to. I also really like the pictures under the pieces to help little ones identify where the pieces go. Great developmental puzzle to have in every collection. It's also a great deal as far as pieces for the price. There are several from Melissa and Doug that have 3 pieces, which is nice for beginners I suppose, but I wanted a little more of a challenge for my guy, and wanted a little better deal for my $. A must buy for your puzzle collection!"
0,1,"Melissa and Doug puzzles are wonderful and this one is no different.  Its super durable, the large knobs are wonderful for small hands.  My 16-month old son loves these."
0,1,Not much to review here. As described and child likes it. Teaches animals of thee farm. It has large knobs for little fingers. Cute!
0,1,"Very cute and cuddly, this baby doll is perfect for wee ones.  This one has a curly sprig of blonde hair on top, a button belly button, a realistic little backside and a cute ID bracelet ready to give her a name of your own.  Rosy cheeks complete the adorable face.  Her pink and white striped shirt is removable as is the diaper.  Cap is sewn on with minimal stitching.  As long as your little one is not biting and chewing everything, this toy will be okay.  If they like to gnaw on everything, I would look out as they can easily chew on the hair as well as the little ribbons which adorn the doll from top to bottom.  At nearly 14 1/2&#34; long, she is a nice enough size not to get lost in the crib or stroller.  Sweet smiling face will make your child smile too!"
0,1,"Adorable. Very soft and snuggly. Great for bedtime. Very well made.The removable diaper seems to be particularly fascinating to my 18 month old daughter. The shirt also comes off, but the hat stays on. We haven't lost the clothing, yet."
0,1,"I've had to stitch this doll up in several places not long after buying it; one hole was there from the start.  I absolutely love the look of it; I prefer the simple face and the soft cloth body.  However, I'm annoyed with the poor quality.  Even more annoying to me was when I emailed the company, they responded quite rudely that I needed to return it through Amazon.  What a pain!  I prefer a company that stands by their products and resolves quality issues themselves."
0,1,"My 3 year old twins love this puzzle.  They received this as a gift when they were 2 and we would make the puzzle for them.  About 2 months before their third birthday, my son was able to make all the animals by himself.  His twin sister lagged behind only a month in her ability to make the puzzles.  This is one of their favorite puzzles and they even take it to bed at night.  At times they work together making the animals, but most of the time they sit independently for a half hour to an hour at a time making the different animals.  As with all puzzles, parents need to be involved to show their child how to work the puzzle.  Once they get the hang of it, they will love to make whatever animal you or they choose.  Today I am ordering today the farm animal block puzzle that is very similar to this one."
1,0,"Never again! Overpriced stuffed animal with pass to virtual world. In order for my kid to earn points to ""purchase"" items for the mutt she had to answer 100 questions with a time limit to each question. So overwhelming for her. Then, when we tried to log on after creating her profile and that whole deal, we couldn't even access her account (no idea why; I am not a totally hopeless chimp when it comes to computer problems). ""Webkinz"", my ___! More like ""Wastekinz""!My further bigmouth opinion on this mutt and my negative raters on 4/27/11: Please, people, if I am overlooking something great about this canine, please at least leave a comment to further educate me and the population at general (re: please see ""Comments"" section of my ""Mall Madness"" review.) If you are just voting my above review as unhelpful because your child is a ""Webkinz"" devotee, please go back to elementary school with said child. My kid loves ""Littlest Pet Shop"", but if an LPS product stinks, I can face the reality of it...I even do not purchase certain products for my kids because I can sense that they stink beforehand, and/or because other humans inform us of the illustrious or degraded state of toys in these reviews. I also believe in passing along my opinions on toys to my daughter- before and after purchase- in order for her to really muse over her future purchases. She has blown away great sums of her own money on poor products lately, and I do not want anybody to waste their money on these mediocre stuffed animals that turn young children into vacant PC nuts...kids need fresh air, not encyclopedic knowledge of mammals (I just go with the flow of education). Oh, and my daughter's opinion of this chihuahua, you ask? Well, it ain't positive...she now knows that the craze of these critters is just a hype, and hers is just waiting for a ride to the local Goodwill."
1,0,The title says it all.  I have been buying Webkins for 5 children and amsurprised that they all still want them - even the 10 year olds.
1,0,"Great 1:16 toy loader! Very realistic for a toy and VERY well made. Hands down better then any other I see in the Toys R Us stores. My almost 3 year old loves all kinds of trucks and he LOVES this and the others I got him. I LOVE it too.Well done 'Bruder'. If my son wants more in the future, 'Bruder' will be first on my list. Well worth the $$$. Top quality."
0,1,"Like the Bull dozer, it's plenty tough, my son loves this bruder toy the most, and best of all, it has a jack hammer/auger attachments for it."
0,1,"As soon as this toy came in the mail, I was disappointed in the size.  However, it was for our daughter's first birthday, and we figured we would see what she thought of it before we sent it back.  She was way more impressed with it than I was.  She had a little trouble getting the rings on at first, but she has gotten really good at it in the two weeks she's had it.  The only thing she can't put on yet is the ball.  The pieces fit well in her hands and so I guess that's either why it is the size it is, or it'd be too heavy if it were bigger.I love that I don't have to worry that this will be recalled due to it being dangerous or toxic.  I also really like that she can put the rings on in any order she wants, not all stackers do that.  My husband is worried that she will throw the ball part and break something but so far it hasn't occurred to her.*edited to add:  our dog ate the red ball off the top.  Emailed the company, who sent a free replacement.  That was pretty awesome.*"
1,0,"Good quality, good toy. Daughter and mom are glad, what else do u need? :)Even my cat plays with it, gnaws rod :)"
0,1,"My son received this at 8months old.  Every day since its arrival I've stacked it back together and put it back on his toy shelfseveral times.  He doesn't understand he is supposed to put it together yet, but he always goes for it on the shelf to upend it and play with the pieces.  We have included the rounds in our structures built out of blocks, we spin the rings on the floor like tops, he chews on the pieces and the base and we talk to him about the colors.  Its beautifully made and a safe, versatile learning toy.  We love it.  I will buy more from plan toys."
0,1,"My son has been playing with the Haba Pegboard since he was one. This is a nice follow up to it because it requires more skill. He is learning is colors and shapes. This is harder because the holes for the shapes are not as deep as the Haba board. And thus, it requires him to use more skill. Sometimes when he is placing a peg deep in the middle another peg falls out. That's okay-- he is learning to be careful. He mastered placement at 20m but his manipulative skills are somewhat advanced.Good skills for the price. Like most Plan Toys products, they aren't quite as nice as the Haba equiv. but are great non-toxic toys at a lower price point."
0,1,This toy met my grandchild&#34;s needs!  She loves it!  It is made of wood and cloth and will last for years!
0,1,"Got this for my 5 year old nephew, and he stopped playing computer games to play with pin art and experiment with it. A hit!!"
0,1,"This broke after only a few months of use, which was disappointing.  Too bad, it was fun while it lasted."
1,0,"Es un producto que ayuda a desarrollar la creatividad en las ni&ntilde;as, les ayuda a dise&ntilde;ar diferentes clases de flores, a mi hija le encant&oacute; mucho. Estoy complacida con la compra"
0,1,"I have three little girls and we make paper flowers frequently. I purchased this kit to have for a birthday party - less prep! I was so disappointed when the girls' fingers turned blue, purple, green, pink... as did my table and anything else the flowers touched."
0,1,"I bought this to entertain ten seven-year-olds at a party during ""craft time"". The kids had fun, and the flowers were fairly easy to make, especially for the girls who had already learned the accordion fold in an art class. Several of the moms enjoyed it too.That was the good news. The bad news came the day after the party, when we realized that someone had dropped some tissue shreds on the floor, which had apparently gotten wet (there was a milk spill at one point), and now there are permanent red stains on our hardwood floor. Even Lestoil couldn't beat it.If you are looking for a fun party craft, you might want to go for it---just be prepared for that permanent souvenir.  Otherwise, try something else."
0,1,"Santa just brought this toy for my 3 children (all girls ages 3.5 years and twin 2 year olds) and we just played with it in the bath tub. Overall, I don't have any *real* complaints about this product.Pros:sufficient suction cups hold fast on plastic backed tub wall.Easy to remove by slipping a fingernail under the suction cup to break the seal.Works as advertised, many variations optional and can be spread out to several feet if so desired.Cons:I might have to get another one, my twins were fighting over it!The monkey wheel did occasionally get stuck, but only for a moment or two and corrected itself.My twins could slide the pieces across the wall while still suctioned on, thereby, making the waterfall effect void. But that is a problem with my children, and not so much the product, so therefore, I did not hold it against the product. It's just something I hadn't anticipated.Overall, my children had a blast with this product. My 3 year old really enjoyed moving the pieces to see if it would still work or work better or what not, she had more fun with it the way it was meant to be played with than my twins, who really enjoyed the monkey the most. Did I mention, the monkeys eyes spin around as the wheel does? They thought that was hilarious! I would recomend this product to my friends and family, and would buy it as a gift to give also. Another great product by Alex Toys!"
0,1,"This is for my son for his first birthday. He hasn't gotten it yet but I did let him sneak a peek and he loved it he was hugging it, sweet! Super cute, love the diaper & hospital bracelet you can personalize."
0,1,"This baby is just darling! I can't wait to give it to my son for Christmas. He'll be 22 months old by then, and I know he will just love it! He loves babies and I was looking for a doll that wasn't too ""girly"" for him. This is perfect!"
0,1,I searched high and low for a little boy/baby doll whose skin wasn't pale white and didn't have blonde hair.  This is one of the few I found.  We've been very happy with it.  It's a sweet baby doll and my toddler son really enjoys it.
1,0,My daughter got this a Christmas present and it's just so cute and soft. She's 15 months old she isn't quite sure how to play with dolls yet but she is learning. I wanted a soft doll for her to play verses the traditional plastic baby. The outfits (sold separately) are pretty darn cute as well. Great doll for young toddlers.
1,0,"This is a wonderful baby doll.  She is simple, very cute, and can easily be used by babies.  My one year old and my nine year old love her."
1,0,"This is a cute cuddly baby doll suitable for little ones.  However, the diaper doesn't stay on properly, and keeps slipping down.  Otherwise it's fine if you're looking for a soft baby doll that's baby safe."
1,0,"low quality, but served its purpose for teaching sorting, counting, and simple math. At first they were really hard to stick together, somy three year old would get very frusterated, but now that we have been using them for a few months they are starting to stick together and pul apart easier."
0,1,"I bought this item thinking blocks were much bigger, and I really got disappointed when I saw them. They are really small and I cannot use them in my playgroups with babies and toddles because this blocks can be easily swallowed. Older kids love them, material is good and resistant, colors are nice and the fact that you can join blocks in so many ways gives children a good  chance to express their creativity... even if it's guns what they mostly want to build I can't blame the toy for that! The toy comes with a list from learning resources suggesting games but I`m a free play fan, so I didn`t try out their suggestions yet."
0,1,"These snap cubes are great for learning math, plus my kids use them to make spinning tops of all shapes and sizes. They are sturdy, but not all pieces stay snapped together well."
0,1,"Learning Resources as a company should be ashamed of themselves. If you are making a product for children, then it shouldn't be something that would make it difficult for them to use. I was so excited when we got these. I got them to help my children to have a physical way of seeing the different math concepts we are learning and for my four year old to learn patterns and such with. I can barely snap most of them together so how will she be able to use them!!! Incredibly disappointed. This was a serious let down. I had been hoping to buy more from this company, glad I tested it out on just one product first, I have no interest in buying any other products from them.On the up side, the colors were really vibrant and if they were easier to put together and didn't poke you with all of their sharp corners as you used them, they would be really nice tools for learning."
0,1,THIS IS ONLY FOR A CHILD THAT IS SCOOTING ABOUT. ALSO CAN HOLD THINGS AND LOVES TO HIT. I SAY ABOUT A KID 9 MONTHS OLD TO 12 MONTHS . CUTE TOY BUT NEEDS TO BE BIGGER FOR OTHER KIDS. 4 STARS BECAUSE IT WAS BROUGHT FOR A NINE MONTH OLD
0,1,This is so much better than having the cards fall all over!  I have to buy a new one because someone needed it worse than I did! But if you are a big card player with lots of friends that like to play then you need this tray holder for sure.
0,1,"I got this for an accessory to my kid's castle playset.  It's of decent quality for the money, though I'm not sure the wings are attached well enough for rough play.  If my kid (2 yrs) got the urge to pull or twist hard on the wings, I think they would break.  Regardless, it makes for a nice villain and he likes to pretend it's flying over his castle, or to pose/sit a small action figure on its back."
0,1,"I'm not sure how this got damaged (one of the horns broke off)  in the mail considering I have it to my 2 year old and there has been no further damage. He loves it though, so an overall win."
0,1,"My son loves math, and my son likes to play with my calculator.  I thought this would be an excellent toy for him because unlike a regular calculator where you type in each number then get an answer but can't see the whole problem at one time, this one displays it just as you would write it out.  This is helpful for visually seeing all the parts of the problem and I think it reinforces math skills.The down side is there are no ""games"" to this.  it is just a calculator, but if you have a kid who likes to play with your calculator, this is a much better choice.There are an add, subtract, Multiply and divide function.  You can do decimal numbers too.  There is no % or square root button.  There is no back button.  No other features that might come on a standard calculator, but most kids don't know what those things are anyway.With the decimal numbers, this little gizmo will line them up just the way you would write them out, which is nice.All in all, this isn't going to be the most fun toy - but I think this IS an ideal kid's calculator."
1,0,"Let me start out by saying, I LOVE Melissa and Doug products.  If you read my other reviews, you'll see that I LOVE their Chunky Puzzles.But I DO NOT RECOMMEND this one at all!1. This is not a good Chunky puzzle.  It is much more flimsy and the stickers peel off the pieces.2. The pieces are NOT shaped like the letter.  So more than one letter will fit in more than one spot... Like the O, G, and C will all fit in the same spots.3. The pictures used to describe the letter are ODD choices... The first time I did the puzzle with my son, it took me a few seconds to figure out what the pieces were supposed to be.4. These pieces are a lot smaller than most of the Melissa and Doug puzzle pieces.I was very disappointed with this puzzle and bought the other Melissa and Doug alphabet puzzle to replace this one!"
1,0,this alphabet puzzle is of good quality. My son has been playing with it for more than half a year. It helped him to associate the letters with the word.
0,1,"My 3 year old is learning the alphabet and I thought this puzzle would be a fun way to practice. I am disappointed because the quality is awful - the wood pieces are chipped and splinter out. I seriously had to buy sand paper to soften it because I was worried someone could get hurt.Was it worth the effort - not so much. The pictures under the letters are not the best choices for a toddler. I understand the idea was to fit something that mimics the shape of the letter, so the space left to place the picture was small and often awkward. Like the ""V"" reveals a ""vine"" (not really something toddlers relate to), the ""E"" is for ""egg,"" which is fine, but ""N"" has a ""nest"" - with the same color eggs in the nest.To be honest, I am really not a huge fan of Melissa & Doug. I like the idea and the toys seem great, but the quality is really not there - especially for the price. The other puzzle we have also had wood chip issues, another wood toy had paint chip almost immediately. I don't want to have to worry about splinters and paint chips - not if I am paying premium prices."
0,1,Great learning toy. We have 4 of these becasue my boys like to spell lots of words!!!! We love these
0,1,"My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter enjoys playing with this puzzle. She takes all the letters out, and she then puts them back with the correct picture. But I agree with the leading negative review that this puzzle is not a good way to learn the ABCs, which my granddaughter already knew. Although it is good for developing fine motor skills (grasping the letters and putting them back in) and associative skills, the pieces are not shaped like the letters. In addition, as other reviews have noted, there are some strange letter choices, such as Q is for quail.However, the pieces are colorful and well made, and my granddaughter finds this entertaining and fun, which is why I gave this four stars instead of three."
0,1,"It has poor quality sound so its hard to play the game.  If I could do it over, I'd try the diggin wobble deck extreme.  It is made by the same company but is less expensive, more versatile and has better reviews."
0,1,"This is a terrific indoor balance toy for preschool and kindergarten-aged children.The toy requires three AA batteries, which are not included.While your child stands on the deck, they are challenged with different games. For example, trying to lean and touch the different colors to the floor without losing their balance.This is a good indoor toy for active children. The quality, workmanship, and durability are all excellent.While it is a noisy toy, it can also be a lot of fun without the batteries."
0,1,Great game and container.While the cylinder is alot bigger than the game itself it is great to not have to put Jenga back together to put it away!They even include a cardboard &#34;guide&#34; to help construct the tower to start the game.
0,1,You can't go wrong with a wooden toy.  My daughter and I play Jenga a lot.  It's fun and challenging and this toy is quality.  They even have Jenga at her elementary school for teachers to check-out if they need a fun game for indoor play recess on rainy or cold days.  This is definitely worth adding to a toy collection (just make sure you keep track of all the pieces.  ;)
0,1,The quality of this plush toy is excellent.  The faux fur feels silky to the touch.  Our 4 and 5 year-old boys loved them.
0,1,I got this baby penguin for my granddaughter for Christmas.  Her mother has a big penguin and she adores hers...I know she will love having a little one of her very own.  No dissappointments on this product
0,1,This was a seceret Santa gift after a co worker asked for a seceret santa gift for a stuffed animal name salomon he looked like a salomon to me.
0,1,"I was looking for something for my 6 year old daughter to keep some basic art supplies organized so she'd always have them at hand when she wanted them.  This little desk is perfect.  It's lightweight, has a padded bottom for balancing her her lap, sturdy elastic straps to hold in a pretty thick pad of paper and zippered two pockets (one on each side) for holding pencils, crayons, etc.  The material is some sort of nylon which is relatively easy to wipe off with a damp cloth if it gets dirty.I wish the pockets on the sides were a little deeper, but that's me being too picky :)"
0,1,"This is kind of fun even for adults to try to balance the penguins on the ice.  It tips pretty easily.  The box suggests 5 and up.  My youngest, who just turned 4, can sometimes place the penguins and my 6-year-old thought it was still somewhat challenging.  5 might be right depending on how much patience the kid has.  Someone wins by being the first to place all his or her penguins on the ice.  For us though, the game felt unfinished with penguins left over so we've sometimes played it as a more cooperative game.  That works for the little ones."
0,1,"On Thanksgiving Eve, my adult son and 12 year old nephew were good sports and took on opening up this game.  They both LOVE penguins and they both are very playful together.  Both have good small item coordination.The first step of this game (aside from extracting the items from their bags) is to connect the black penguin jackets to the little white penguin bodies.  They found some of these didn't fit easily, but they got them all dressed.They said that getting the penguins to stay balanced on the iceberg is harder than it first seems.  What they both questioned right away was because all of the penguins are identical, players can't tell or easily keep track which player has more penguins.  They suggested that the penguins be divided by color.Granted, they aren't five years old, but they lost interest pretty quickly and thought that because the balance is so ""tricky"", it could be frustrating to a five year old.  They both gave it 2 1/2 stars.I like that no batteries need to be included and that those little penguins are so cute. I also like that a child could play solo and work on the fine art of balance."
0,1,"The game itself is fun. I'm not sure why it is rate 5 and up (unless it is for small parts). My 3 year old can play with the older kids. You balance the penguins on the wobbly ice. Don't make the penguins fall! Easy concept. Challenging. And fun.The penguins themselves come in 3 separate pieces, which you have to put together before the kids can play the game. It isn't difficult, but there are quite a few penguins to make. I really wish the penguins came put together and in one piece. The kids can easily take the penguins apart, leaving you to remake penguins as they unmake them. This makes an otherwise very kid independent game very mom intensive."
1,0,"I had this game in my fourth grade classroom for use during recess.  It was a perfect game for that setting.  Several can play, besides being fun to watch.  No reading or counting is required.  It was also nice because we had recess residents from the special classes, and they could compete, too.  The rounds move quickly enough that several children got turns during our twenty minute breaks.  The only thing is keeping up with the penguins, but we managed."
0,1,"I'm a big fan of most Ravensburger games and puzzles and I really like the idea behind this toy. I love games that involved fine motor skills and my daughter, at 4.5 typically does really well with them. Even though this game is for ages 5 and up, she's usually somewhat ahead of her peers in terms of motor skills. Unfortunately, she really can't do this game. Honestly, I can't really either and I'm a 30-something adult. It's actually sort of frustrating. I'm looking at all the reviews here and only a handful mention how incredibly hard this game is. My daughter loves games and was really incredibly frustrated with this game. It was a bit of a blow to her self-esteem since usually she excels at things involving gross and fine-motor skills.Maybe in a few years we can try again, but given that even I have a hard time with this, I'm not even sure we'll be playing much of it down the road. Great idea, but the execution is really maybe too hard."
1,0,"My main complaint with this item is that the ball sorta lazily hang next to the post with little clearance; to get it to stick out like the picture, you need to wail on it pretty hard; it's very difficult for a 6 year old to learn with. Even trying to adjust the ball's height is difficult because it slides down the line.Fortunately, the kids like hitting things with the bat, hence two stars instead of one."
0,1,"I have two main problems with this toy.  First, it's made of very thin plastic, which means it's just flimsy overall.  It's several pieces of a thin plastic piping that fit together (just one inside the the other) to make the T.  I just can't see it holding up to much abuse.Second, from the picture it appears that the ball is on some sort of wire that sticks out and swings around when hit.  Not so.  It is on a string - but it's not actually string, it's a small piece of plastic or vinyl-like tubing.  So it doesn't stick out like in the picture - the ball just flops down.  You are supposed to wind it around the pole, and then hit it as it unwinds.  However, the string is very short and the ball is held in the middle of it, so the ball is actually only a few inches from the pole.  It looks quite a bit further from the pole than it actually is, at least the one we have.  So you're swinging at a ball that is just turning slowly around a flimsy plastic stick and which is never more than a few inches from the pipe.  Not much to aim at, and most of the time my kid just whacked the pipe.  Also not much fun to hit the ball, since it can only wind a few times around the pole.  I really just don't see the point of this - it's not any kind of good hitting practice and it's not any fun.  As a T, the top is very small and the ball has to be balanced carefully, so it is far inferior to others with a wider place to set the ball.The only good thing about this toy is the bat.  The bat is actually very good quality.  Sturdy, and well cushioned, so that even when my kid batted me by accident, it didn't hurt.  It's the only part of the toy that didn't feel just really cheap."
0,1,This toy is awesome and my son loves to recreate a football game while we are watching football! I appreciate that the plastic container it comes in is actually useful and keep everything from getting lost!
0,1,"My 3 year old boy loves this.  He is often ""fixing"" things with this set.  He carries the swiss army knife style toy around in his pocket ""just in case.""  So sweet and they are safe enough for a younger child too.  There are black round pieces that I am not sure what they are, but if I really looked at it I could probably figure it out.  Good, simple and not to expensive tools perfect for this age and good to grow with."
1,0,"We received this game as a birthday gift for my 4 year old, and we really enjoy it.  My only stink about it is the ""kitty bowl"" which is flimsy and cheap.  A real bummer when you have an active kid wanting to play the game; I know I will have to replace the bowl with one of our own soon.  That said, the little wooden mice and the dice are sturdy and cute.  If we ditch the bowl and put the pieces in a little bag, it could be a good traveling game(restaurant diversion!)."
1,0,"I love this game! As an in-home daycare provider I have a variety of ages at any given time. This game works well for the younger ones wanting to play a game when the school kids get here, and works well for my 4 and 6 year olds in the evening. My 4-year old is so happy to have a game she can easily remember how to play and the bigger kids don't have to keep telling her. And I like to be able to pull it out and not have to review the instructions! Love it!"
0,1,"While entertaining, there's not much ""game"" to this... game.  It's all luck, no strategy or ability to impact how the game moves or progresses.  While that may be age-appropriate for 2 year olds, this game is definitely well below the suggested developmental age range of 4.  I wouldn't even rate the educational value of this game very high, as by the age of 4, kids can already count, discern directions, and read symbols.  The game isn't worthless, just not on par with Gamewright's usual flair, and definitely developmentally geared toward younger children.  As this game has small pieces, though, it wouldn't be feasible to play this game with children in that age range.  I don't recommend this game for 4+.  Rather, check out Kids of Carcasonne, or Monza."
0,1,"I bought this for my granddaughter's trip to Georgia.  She's five, and it was a long drive.  The desk part could be a little more sturdy, but she loved the idea that she could fill it with so much stuff and then just zip it all up and bring it in the house with her.  I filled it with a lot of stuff, too - stickers, crayons, coloring books, reading books - and they all fit neatly.  She likes choosing what to put in it and even brings it on much shorter trips.  No more complaining from the back seat of &#34;When are we going to get there?&#34;"
1,0,"I love this set. They haven't had many opportunities to play with it yet, due to being heavier blocks and I have (and want to keep) my younger kids.  I do anticipate them playing with this beautiful set for many years."
0,1,"Great quality, just wish there were a few more pieces otherwise would give it a 5. My 4yo and 2yo sons love these."
0,1,"My grandaughter loves webkinz and wanted this for Christmas. He was thrilled when he got it. Material smooth, but durable."
0,1,"these are very handy as we are always building big designs and need a large surface area. they are a bit flimsy, so you can't be super rough with them as some 2 year olds can be. overall, they are great to have, especially when you have 2 kids and each kid wants their own."
0,1,"We looked all over town for extra plates to use with BIG legos and our mega bloks.  They come with small plates in the sets but no one had LARGE plates for the BIG legos, only for the tiny legos which are not compatible with the duplo series.  I inquired with the company as one person said returns on this product were a hassle.  The company responded quickly to assure me these are the ones compatible with the large legos.  Upon receiving the product they were indeed what I expected but wow 15x15"" looks a lot larger in person, as one reviewer stated, storing these can be pain, especially considering they are not a durable THICK base like the small plates that come in sets, no these are a very thin base, easy to snap and break.  Will have to add ""build lego table"" to the honey-do list :).  Other than the complaint that they are so flimsy the purpose is exactly what I was needing to expand our creative building!"
0,1,"Legos are an excellent toy.  Our daughter loves them, especially dumping them out.  base plates are holding up well and work well to provide a smooth easy surface when building on carpet."
0,1,These building plates will add to the fun of the Duplos which I have also purchased from Amazon.  These toys are for visiting grandchildren to play with and will last for many years.
0,1,these are small and ideal for  kids each code allows you  to play online with them i will buy more
0,1,for anyone that likes rabbits this would be perfect for u its is so cute and can fit anywhere if u want it to go with u
0,1,"I bought this for 9yr old dd but I have ended up using it way more then her,I am 49 by the way.It is really relaxing and keeps your mind and hands busy while hubby is flicking channels;). The material is a bit pricey so I was wondering if any one has tips on clothes they scraped,legs,sleeves ,ect  to use on the loom?Maybe childrens clothes that have holes or worn out elastic?"
1,0,These dinosaur bath squirters are great! I initially bought these for cake decorations for my son's first birthday. They were a hit on his cake. He now plays with them every night in the bath. They are easy to clean and squirt very well. A good size for little hands.
0,1,This is my son's favorite doggie and he sleeps with it every night.  It's so cute and plush.  This is actually our second one since we lost the first one and my son was so upset.
0,1,"Don't know much about Webkinz, but I do recognize cute, and this little pug is cuteness personified. It's a soft little thing with big expressive eyes, a tan coat, and black ears and muzzle. His curly tail is the epitome of pug and even his crooked little plastic nose is endearing. Owners of pugs will appreciate this cutie and fans of Webkinz will love it all the more. There's even a colorful, embroidered W on the bottom of one front paw.The tag says that the toy is not recommended for children under three. It contains polyester fiber and plastic pellets. This Webkinz pug was born in China."
0,1,"I got the coloburst(pastel)for my now 2 1/2 year-old daughter when she was only a few months old.  Since she had chewed on it, I wanted to get a new one when I found out I was expecting a boy.  We got the classic(bright colos) before he was born. He was able to grasp at it in only a month or two, due to its narrow rods, strecthy bands and light weight.  My daughter still plays with it. The moving parts, ease of holding and ablity to compress make it a great toy to learn how and why things work and teach color recognition.  My 2 1/2yr old has not tired playing with it and I see it being around for some time to come."
0,1,"Just gave this to my 2.5 year old son for Christmas.  He likes to race us and it getting better at it.  It is good for fine motor development and eye/hand coordination especially when he puts the egg back in the shell and has to line up the 2 halves.  Also teaches color matching and patience.  They eggs go back together easily, not like those cheap Easter eggs that drive you crazy.  Can't wait to have some of his toddler friends try this game with him!  Seems well built and durable.  Good price as well."
0,1,"Beautiful set, great colors! You can definitely do alot of teaching with this set...colors, shapes, numbers, lacing, of course. I highly reocmmend."
1,0,"My 2.5 year old kids are having a difficult time putting the string through the holes - not because they don't know what to do, but because the rigid ends of the string that are covered in plastic are too short (those ends are probably as short as on a regular shoestring).  Also, to have such a long string is 1. dangerous 2. what's the point - even if you put all of these on one string, you'll have 2/3 of the length still available.  I much prefer the strings with a solid rigid edge on one end, and a big knot on the other, so that the beads are not falling off of it.  Definitely not for smaller children."
1,0,"These are fun for my 2.5 year old. He likes stringing them and dragging them around behind him. However, the insides of holes are very rough and the string catches on it, which can make it difficult to string and frustrating for a toddler. I've considered using sandpaper to smooth them out, but just haven't done it yet."
0,1,"This toy is simple, yet kids go back to it time and time again. My two and three yr old love putting the beads on and even our five year old enjoys working patterns."
0,1,My 3 year old lovvvved this product! had so much fun she did not want to share! I would definitely buy this again.
1,0,I did not think my 3 years old twins would like these as we got them for a gift. I was wrong! They love using these and even used them to play with their action figures.
0,1,"While we love lacing beads for several reasons including the fact that they promote hand eye coordination, we have decided to shop around for another set instead.When we opened this one, the pieces were of a nice weight, a great size for a toddler, and my daughter was excited to play with them. However, after a days use there were already several pieces with large paint chunks missing. She is not one to play hard either. I feel uncomfortable using this product in my house especially since my daughter still tends to taste test things, and since other Melissa & Doug items have been recalled in the past (as a note: this was a gift. We did not choose to purchase from this brand again). After also considering the bright and colorful blocks design, I think they are too busy. All the pieces are contrasting against different colored backgrounds, as opposed to a bright letter on a neutral background."
0,1,We LOVE Melissa & Doug products.. In fact I try to order 2-5 a month for my 2 year old. I was VERY sad when this item came and within an hour was broken. NOT DURABLE AT ALL.. I have never ever had any issues with any of their other products so hopefully it was just a fluke.
0,1,"I bought these for my grand daughter (2 years old).  I remember having something similar for my children so wanted to purchase again.  They work well and can be used in many different ways.  She loves to stack them, but I also use them to teach her the alphabet.  She uses them to put things into, also.  They are fairly sturdy even with some rough play.  (Of course they can't hold up when someone stands on them which she is not allowed to do.)"
0,1,"Cardboard toy with a toddler NOT...I thought it would be more sturdier. My daughter had a good time after one use, but by the secnd use I was picking up pieces of cardboard. My daughter wanted to sit on them, knock them over, and do all things most toddler do with toys. I had to toss one block already. I would highly recommend that someone purchase this sort of toy in plastic. That way it's more durable and easy to clean if needed."
0,1,"I bought these blocks for my 17 month old son. Luckily they were not expensive because they are not very durable. I stack these for him, and he loves plowing into them to knock them down. Then he sits and puts each block into it's nesting partner, hands them to me, and we start the whole process over again...so they have been a great way for us to pass the time!Unfortunately, we've only had these blocks for a few weeks and they're already starting to fall apart. Made of cardboard, they're covered in stickers that soon start to peel. If you have a child who likes to put things in his mouth (as I'm sure most of us do), then the edges of the blocks will soon start to become flimsy and less block-shaped. I don't highly recommend these, but I also wouldn't tell people to avoid them. Just be aware that if you purchase them, you most likely won't have them very long."
0,1,"These are cute - this is our second set of nesting blocks, first time purchasing the Melissa and Doug version. The color scheme is not appealing to me, but my daughter seems to like them. I purchased this set because she was peeling and eating the plastic coating off of our last set. There is not plastic coating on these, but she has managed to peel some of the cardboard off. This set looks a lot chintzier than our last, but as long as she is not eating plastic, I'm happy. The letters were squeezed on the blocks in an odd way, but again it didn't seem to bother my dauther. Oh, and if anyone has kids who are afraid of alligators (ahem), A is for alligator!"
0,1,Melissa and Doug products are of very high quality and I have ordered several of their products in the past.  My granddaughter likes to do crafts and absolutely loved this set!!!  She even turned off the TV as soon as I gave it to her to make some bracelets up for her friends.  I highly recommend this product!!
0,1,"I got this and it has been a hit a playdates.  There are lots of pieces to make necklaces and bracelets with.  It would be nice if there were various lengths in the shoestrings that are in the kit.  it doesn't work as well to cut them, but still lots of fun."
0,1,My 5 year old loves making pretty bracelets and necklaces for herself and all of her friends. The beads are easy to string on the including string and the beads are plentiful. She has multiple Melissa & Four beading sets that she loves to combine to make really pretty pieces that she wears constantly. They're durable enough to wear all the time just like mommy does.
0,1,"I chose this rattle because it was cute and matched the nursery colors. Having examined it, I felt it was a worthwhile rattle that would be useful for play and teething."
0,1,"I bought this for my son when he was two years old.  At that time he was interested in it as a puzzle, and had so much fun putting the shapes where they belonged, as he did I would remind him what shape it is and the number on it.  He quickly learned number recognition, and shape recognition.  He is three and a half now and knows all of the shapes and numbers on the clock.  He is just now getting interested in it as a clock.  Time telling will come next.None of the paint has chipped and the wooden pieces are nice.  This is a well made toy, it is bright and colorful and attracts attention from every child who visits.I rated it as four stars instead of 5 because I'm not sure it would hold every child's attention for very long periods of time.  It just depends on the kid."
0,1,cant go wrong with a melissa and Doug product. i love the durability of all there products. the clock is great at teaching the little ones shapes and time
0,1,"Very colorful, sturdy, very educational and my 3 yr old loves playing with it almost every day. Some of the shapes are a bit challenging for a 3 yr old, since they're quite similar, but that's half the fun, trying to figure out where they fit. Absolutely recommend it for teaching numbers, shape and time at a more advanced stage."
0,1,"I bought this product when it was on sale, so I got a great price for a wonderful product! Very well made, colorful, durable, and very educational. I think it is very important to buy educational products for our children; they usually receive so many gifts that are ""over the top"" and not useful. I highly recommend this item!"
0,1,"This is another great Melissa and Doug toy!  My son is 2 and loves the puzzle aspect of this, we are also using it to learn colors and shapes. I foresee this one hanging around till we are learning time too!!"
0,1,My daughter is two and loves playing with this clock. Right now she likes taking the pieces out and then putting them back in the right place. She knows most of the shapes and all of the numbers so she likes to tell me what they are as she puts them in. When she gets a little older I think it will be perfect for teaching her to tell time.
1,0,My 24 month old mastered the shapes in about 20 minutes and lost interest quickly. I wasn't expecting him to catch on so fast so I was a bit disappointed. I will be able to use this again when teaching time and tertiary colors but for now it will be stored.
0,1,"This is good toy  for kids to begin learning about not only clocks, but also shapes, order of numbers etc."
0,1,"We got it as a Christmas Gift :)This clock puzzle is an excellent addition to my 18 months old daughter puzzles. She loves them. The clock brings a challenge, which is great for her development. She is learning numbers, shapes, colors and time. All 4 at the same time. The toy made very well and colorful."
0,1,"One of my kids is interested in telling time, and another is interested in shapes.  They both like playing with this clock.I read a lot of reviews that complained that the 5 has six sides and the 6 has five sides.  Mine must be a later model, because the 5 has five sides and the 6 has six sides. But even if they were the old way, I wouldn't have been bothered by this at all:  the 2 has four sides and the 9 has four sides and the 10 has four sides and the 11 has four sides and the 12 has ten sides---so the number of sides don't correspond to the number on the shape, and they're clearly not supposed to."
1,0,"My 5 year old is desperate to tell time so she can earn her own watch.  This clock is great, it teaches numbers, shapes, colors and time.  My 2 year loves it too!"
0,1,"After reading a review that said that this toy was too immature for a five year old I felt compelled to write a review.  I purchased this toy years ago(maybe 6 or 7) for a preschool program I had for 4 and 5 year olds, and it was definitely a favorite for the children.  Some enjoyed the puzzle aspect and playing with the hands and the more advanced kids could explore the time telling component.  They could play together and learn from one another. I have since moved and left that toy behind with the program (along with many other favorites).  I now have a family of my own, a one year old and a six year old in Kindergarten and I just purchased this toy again to give as a Christmas gift for the six year old.  I am so excited to have this toy again!  One reason I got it was because I know that both children can play with it, together and separately.  But I am giving it to the older one because he is just getting into his numbers and time and I know this simple toy will encourage him to explore those concepts in a natural, progressive way.  I am not a fan of the computerized, battery operated ""educational"" toys that tell you stuff when you press a button. No thanks, not for my kids.  I truly believe in learning through play, and that children show interest in learning when they are ready to.  This is a toy that fosters those concepts.  Furthermore, I have been amazed recently at how much interest my 6 year old has in the ""baby"" toys for my one year old!  I think we all sometimes forget that even big kids are still little!  They enjoy simple things....and need them! There are so many fancy toys out there, and yes, they like those and want them, but I think we sometimes get ahead of ourselves. While I am still getting my big guy some big kid toys this Christmas, I am also including some classic simple toys like this one.  I am looking forward to watching the kids play together with this:)"
1,0,"Bought this for my 2 year old's birthday.  She enjoys placing the shapes in the correct hole.  She does not yet know numbers so will sometimes place a number upside down etc.  It is appropriate for her age, but I think she will grow into the toy as I'll be able to teach her numbers and then the clock as she gets older. It is excellent quality."
0,1,i love everything melissa and doug makes. usually very durable and educational. this should be fun. my 3 year old is great at working puzzles and this is the next step in her preschool learning.
0,1,"Wow, this clock has saved me a lot of times. Whenever my kid cries, I put this in front of him and he stops crying and plays with it. What else can I ask for?"
0,1,"This puzzle is fantastic. it has taught and helped my twin 3 year olds learn their alphabet so much! It is fun and easy to do, but really is a great product. Sound quality is great. No problems here."
1,0,"This combo of puzzles is so ingenious! My kiddo loves them. I know it for a fact because whenever he opens the drawer to pick out a puzzle (out of 20), his hand always comes out with this one. The pieces are big, the colors are great, the drawings are clear and cute.My kiddo chewed one piece, oh, IDK why he chose the ship. :) Daddy & I are still investigating.I recommend it. Great gift, too!"
0,1,"These puzzles are great quality.  the problem I have with this particular puzzle is that the way some of the pieces are cut, they do not really &#34;hook&#34; into each other.  The result is a puzzle piece that will kind of shift when little hands are trying to put another piece in.  Not the end of the world or anything, but it can lead to a grumpy 3 year old that wants it to be perfect once he puts in the piece."
0,1,"I almost got the world puzzle instead, but this one had more positive reviews, so I went with it. This puzzle has the same issue that people were complaining about with the world one. It is not a jigsaw puzzle. The pieces do not hook together. It says 6+ and I got it for my 2-year-old, so that could be part of the problem. However, I did it myself and had trouble, and my 6-year-old nephew helped me all of two minutes before he gave up.The pieces are colorful and seem durable, but what's the point when the pieces won't stay together? Even after I got the whole thing assembled, it wasn't sturdy.If I still had the packaging, I would return it."
0,1,"Our almost four year old uses this puzzle to remember the places he has been.  He also likes to picture places where family lives and traveled.  It is one of those great toys that prompts a nice talk with a little learning on the way.  And it is truly sturdy.  It has survived raids from little brother, &#34;Jaws&#34; who is eight months and distinctly destructive.  This is a puzzle that will be fun for a long time as the owner comes to be able to work it alone."
0,1,This is one great puzzle.  It is a great teaching aid as well.  I love everything about it. We love doing it together.
1,0,We are working on learning the states and capitals with my 3 year old grandson so this works great to facilitate this.
1,0,"Great Puzzle. WE now have a 5 year old that knows where her states are, and learning their capitals. High Quality, nice size. A+."
0,1,I was very cautious about buying this floor puzzle thinking it will be hard to put together or that the pieces will be too small for a 3 yr old but I am so glad I bought it. This puzzle is massive! The pieces are very large so putting it together is so much easier. The cardboard is sturdy and the pieces fit together perfectly. It keeps them challenged as they learn about the states as there's so much to learn from this puzzle. Highly recommend.
1,0,"One of the things I like the most about this card game is that my 15, 13 and 7 year old can all play together and the youngest one can beat the older children.Each player is dealt 4 cards face down, Cards have the numbers 0 to 9 on them. Along with cats on the lower numbers and rats on the higher numbers. Object of the game is to exchange your cards without looking at all of them to obtain the lowest points in front of you. At the beginning of the game you can look at two of the cards, but from that point on you can only look at the card you draw and then you can choose to exchange it for a card in front of you. You can't look at your cards infront of you for the rest of the play of the game, Unless you draw a Peek card. The game is played to 5o or 100 points. highest pionts going out first. The game consists of several small rounds played lasting from a couple minutes to a few minutes, depending on when someone feels they have the lowest points and announces Rat-a-tat cat. At that point all remaining players get one more turn and then every one gets to turn their cards over and add up their points.Good for around age 4 and up.We have played this so much we are in need of another deck of cards."
0,1,"Update: I contacted them and they said their puzzle is light sensitive. It does work 100% of the time when in good light. So it works most of the time but does randomly go off because of this. My kid is 17 mo.  The product itself is made well and most of the sounds are really good. If you put the piece in the wrong hole, it still makes the correct noise."
0,1,"Terrific, realistic animal sounds as long you put not - included AAAs in with a teeny screwdriver.Wonderful quality product. I would have appreciated a prompt to purchase batteries and a tiny tool for constructive criticism. Excellent quality! !"
1,0,"When they are pieces belonging to a Melissa and Doug Farm Sound Puzzle, that's when - and that's when the barnyard becomes confusing!  The colorful nature of this puzzle, and the fact that each piece would cause the appropriate sound to be made were what attracted me to this puzzle for my grandson.  At fourteen months-old, he is very interested in the sounds different things make; he loves to imitate different animals.  This puzzle seemed the perfect Christmas gift.The puzzle base is made of wood, as are the individual pieces.  Edges are smooth and there was no splintering which might injure a child.  The animals were depicted realistically and the sounds were fairly representative of each animal.Unfortunately, we quickly discovered Melissa and Doug failed to work out the ""quirks"" of their sound puzzles prior to selling them.  The actual sounds are either light activated or activated by a chip on each piece and in each cut-out, so covering a shape is what causes the animal to ""speak.""  Our grandson quickly discovered that if he couldn't find the duck - his favorite animal at Christmas - he could cause the puzzle to quack using any of the other animals.  All that was required was to bring another piece close enough to the duck-shaped cutout to activate the quack.  Further, my daughter told me today that if pieces are missing and one turns off the lights in a room, there is a cacophony of sound.In my opinion, these are not an acceptable characteristics in an educational toy.  While toddlers may find the noise and their ability to make a duck ""moo"" highly amusing, the supposed educational factor is missing.  It would have been better if the different pieces had individualized activation chips or if the chip in each piece and matching cutout were located in different spots for each animal.  The sensitivity would need to be such that pieces would have to be within a minimum distance - one in which a puzzle piece was actually being inserted in the cutout- to activate.I have rated this as only an average toy because of its deficiencies.  That is a real shame as it could have been a five-star product if the items addressed above had not been present."
0,1,"My daughter loves to pretend to chop things so I knew this was the perfect gift. It is very well made. All the pieces are made of wood and are very high quality. The velcro makes a satistying crunch when she uses the wood ""knife"" to separate the pieces. One great bonus is that pieces are like a puzzle. So she can learn some critical thinking by trying to figure out which piece goes where while ALSO trying to make sure the velcro lines up. Great addition to a kitchen set or just to help improve fine motor skills. Highly recommended."
0,1,"My son loves cutting fruits, vegetables and bread, who knew? So I was on the look out for some more interesting toys. My son loves mowing and books and vacuuming and balls and cars and trains but he seemed to be progressively bored as these things were no longer challenging him. So my sister suggested the veggie cutting set and he loves it. The moment we got it he went straight to it and started to try and master the cutting and in a few days his knife handling skills have improved and he is very proud of himself whenever he cuts through anything. he likes pretending to eat the veggies and we have been working on colors and halves and quarters. Seriously hours of fun and it is educational. Highly recommend. It is good quality and will last."
0,1,"I was surprised by its size (got used to tiny wooden pieces by this price), unexpected good quality, this set  consists of 8 wooden pieces, velcro seems to be durable. Considering to buy a few more if avalible. My 1,5 yo son loved it."
1,0,"I purchased this based on the Amazon reviews and have not been disappointed.  Our two-year-old daughter enjoys this toy and plays with it for 15-30 minutes at a time (which, for a two-year-old, is an eternity).  The different items are at different level of difficulty, so the sliced bread, carrot, and pepper are much harder than the watermelon and French bread.  I like that they get some sensation of cutting with the knife."
1,0,"This is a great set that comes with fruit and veggies cut into slices and held together with velcro, dull wooden knives and a little cutting board. It comes in a wooden box with a plastic top that can be used to store the pieces when not in use. The kids love the cutting action and playing with them when they are assembled and whole.My only caution is to be somewhat diligent with keeping these together as a set or else they may scatter throughout the house (as happened with us). My kids got frustrated when they wanted a whole piece of food and they could only find half.Also great from this company is the new wood pizza which has pieces to ""slice"" and little wood toppings to construct a custom made pizza pie."
0,1,My daughter enjoys cutting her food but I do have to help her figure out how to put it back together.  I also like that it's all healthy food.  The colors are vibrant and the pieces are durable.
0,1,My kids are ages 3 and 2. They both love this. I might buy another one to keep at my parents' house. Keeps them so busy. They played more with this than any other toy Santa brought them.
1,0,"My children never tire of this toy! They love to slice the fruit, serve it to each other on small plastic plates, and pretend to eat it. I love that this toy is durable and has a lot of play value. This toy has become one of my gift staples; whenever someone throws a party for their toddler or preschooler this is the first thing I think to give them."
0,1,Great for learning how to cut things and be more independent at the dinner table. My girls love making their own dinner and cutting it up like the adults.
0,1,My 2 year old and 4 year old love this set and it is played with often.
0,1,"did not get into this all that much.  Played with it and put it away many times.  It does not come with a cover or a box, so once it's opened all the pieces are exposed to dust, etc."
0,1,"I bought this toy for my 2.5 year old son who loves cooking and asks me if he can cut vegetables and fruits using a real knife!He loves using the knife and cutting vegetables & fruits that he puts in a pot to cook. He recognizes and names the fruits and vegetables, and we also review colors using them.It comes with a wooden box and a cutting board."
1,0,"I got this for my daughters 2nd Birthday.  It is fantastic.  We both enjoy playing with it, it is very durable, she loves to cut the fruit, veggies and bread on the chopping board.  Would highly recommend this for any toddler."
0,1,I am big on buying well rated toys.  This one rated well and so I bought it for my 2yr old's bday.  thinking why is this going to be fun. I was skeptical. Well she loves it!  We cut and put together these pieces of food over and over again.  She laughs and just has the best time with it.  Her being 2 it is way not an independent toy.  I have to help her put the pieces together and I have to hold the pieces and adjust them so she can get the knife in to slice.  So it is more of a let's play together opposed to having a toy she can do on her own.  Very nice quality as well.  I highly recommend.  I do see though where after a bit we will have to fix some of the velcro so if you don't like having to fix toys then this probably won't last long.
0,1,My three year old daughter loved this as a present.  She really enjoy's &#34;cutting&#34; the food up and serving it to people.  This is a great addition to any child's &#34;kitchen&#34;.
0,1,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 2.5, and she still plays with it (she's 7 now). The velcro is good quality, and the cutting sounds are relatively realistic. It has provided hours of fun, imaginative play. The velcro still sticks, even after 5 years, and the paint hasn't faded. Great product!"
0,1,My son was introduced to this toy by a physical therapist just a couple months before his 3rd birthday. He was so excited to &#34;cut&#34; because he's watched me prepare a million meals and I've always told him that knives are for grown-ups. His therapist was practicing &#34;taking turns&#34; and having him feed a puppet with the pieces he was cutting. Lots of sensory elements to this toy & educationally sound too. The food items look so appetizing - yeah for fruits & veggies!
1,0,"The carrot, as pictured, now only cuts into half (horizontally), not vertically into several chunks anymore.  I have seen the set in-store as well, and it is that way also.  It's not so much a choking hazard for little ones anymore, but on the flip side, it takes away some of the cutting fun and limits it's versatility somewhat compared to the other version."
0,1,My niece and nephew just love to play 'kitchen'.  My sister tells me this was their favorite gift - the play food from Melissa and Doug!
0,1,"My daughter as a lot of products for Melissa and Doug...She loves them, and they last forever. I love they are made for wood. This one is no different."
0,1,"My daughter got this for her birthday, and it holds up to Melissa and Doug standards.  She loves it as well as her other M&D items."
0,1,"I'm a speech pathologist and the kids I work with love this game.  Younger students practice their math skills by keeping a total of Mt. Olympus (on paper), while older students enjoy the challenge of remembering the total as the game is played.  A great game for elementary-aged kids."
0,1,"The Fisher-Price Grow-to-Pro Basketball is a wonderful way to allow your little one to play the same games he/she sees the ""big kids"" playing.  Since the hoop can be set at 3 feet, even two-year olds can dunk the basketball.The guide, which attaches to the back portion of the hoop is a well thought out feature since it ""returns"" the basketball directly to the front of the set-up when the ball falls through the hoop.  For little ones, this feature helps avoid the frustration of the ball ""running away"" as it might do were the guide not in place.  Once the basketball hoop ""grows,"" the guide can be removed when your child understands he/she must move around to catch the basketball.At the 3-foot setting, there is no need to fill the base with water or stand; this is a real plus when you are using the Grow-to-Pro indoors during inclement weather.  Since our two-year old grandson lives in the northeast, the Grow-to-Pro will provide physical activity during the cold, winter months.  Once the basketball hoop grows, next summer, his parents will add water or sand so that the Grow-to-Pro remains stable on more uneven outdoor surfaces.Another nice feature of the Grow-to-Pro is the well to hold the ball when it is not in use.  There is a well on either side of the base.  The basketball is small and soft enough so that little ones are comfortable using it; further, this minimizes the potential for damage to your home - or to little ones.  Unfortunately, the softer ball does not bounce particularly well.In my experience, Fisher-Price always seems to do an excellent job smoothing the plastic seams on their products.  There are no sharp or high edges which might cut more tender skin.  The Grow-to-Pro Basketball is fairly easy to assemble.  You will definitely want to lightly smear liquid soap on the posts before inserting them into the base.  It makes a significant difference since the posts, necessarily, fit tightly into the base.If you are looking for a basketball hoop which even two-year olds can enjoy, I recommend that you consider the Fisher-Price Grow-to-Pro Basketball.  In addition to teaching a child to take turns and to continue to try to succeed, the Grow-to-Pro is well made; will last for a number of years; and is a good way to encourage physical activity.  Grandma gives this toy 5 stars!"
0,1,"This is a fabulous toy for Dad and his son!  I gave this to my two year old grandson, and immediately Dad was giving him lessons on slam dunks, hoop shots, etc.  The product is very sturdy and we have had no problems with it all.  A good investment."
1,0,"Easy assembly, ball return is a nice touch.  We have it inside at it's full height and it is much harder for my 4 year old to make baskets, which is exactly why I bought it. We do not have the base filled and it seems pretty stable and has not fallen over yet even when using a heavy ball.  No issues."
0,1,"This was a Christmas gift for my four year old son and he loves it!  In fact, the entire family loves it!  We have it set up in our basement and it seems like someone is always playing with it.  My husband and I have competitions, my 11yr old, 9yr old and 6yr old daughters love it, my son loves it and even our 2yr old daughter tries to make a basket!  The ball return is fantastic because it keeps you from having to chase the ball all over the place.  The toy is sturdy as well and we only have a tiny bit of water in the base."
1,0,"My 2 year old can't get enough of this, he gets all sweaty he plays so hard and long. I thought it was super easy to put together, not sure why other reviewers had so much trouble. Just get up high enough so you can lean your weight on it and gently rock it around until it pops in."
1,0,I bought this for two of my grandchildren (boy & girl) who really like it.  I have only seen it on Skype.  They have called so I can watch them play.  They are only two & four but my daughter put it at the end of the hall so it made it nice for them to shoot baskets.  I like that this can grow with them.  They are both very tall (off the height charts at the doctors) so I liked that it can be moved up and down. I can see them getting years of use out of this.  I was especially happy because I received a great price on Black Friday.
0,1,"We bought this for our daughter's second birthday.  Here's what we like and don't like.Pros:1. We like the magnetic side.  We bought some of the melissa and doug ""magnetics in a box"" sets to use- our daughter loves to play with the magnetic animals.  It's one of her favorite afternoon activities.  The magnetic letters that come with it will be used as she gets older.2. Chalk side- she's had fun with this too.  The chalk that comes with it is tiny and breaks so I went and bought some super large, chunky chalk and it is much better.  She enjoys coloring, using a wet rag to wipe it off and start over.3. Size- I like that it is on the smaller side.  It's the perfect size to take with us when we go to a restaurant, car ride, etc.4. We haven't used the dry erase side yet- she is to young for markers.5. We like the little string that you can use to hang this board up.  Our daughter has a child size table and chair set in the kitchen and we hung this chalk board/dry erase board up above the table.  She loves to pull it down and play with it while I'm making dinner but it also looks really cute hanging on the wall above her table.CONS:1. Chalk is very skinny, small, cheap, breakable.  You almost have to go out and buy some of the larger pieces of chalk to use that are more sturdy.2. No ledge to put the chalk.3. The eraser that comes with it is only for the dry erase board.  It doesn't work on the chalk side so you also have to go out and buy a little chalk eraser.  They aren't expensive but still, it's aggravating to have to go out and get it.4. It would be nice if there were...a. more dry erase colorsb. if the dry erase markers were washable.  Our 2 year old is to young to be careful with markers so she can't use them yet b/c they aren't washable.Overall, this was a good purchase and we would buy it again.  Our daughter very much enjoys playing with the magnetic/chalk side and will grow into the dry erase side as she gets older."
0,1,My 3 year old loves this puzzle.  He's always asking to do the &#34;ABC animal one&#34; when I ask him which puzzle he'd like.  It's made really well and can take being dropped a lot by little hands.
0,1,This is an excellent model of a pachycephalosaurus.  The design is inspired by the movie Jurassic Park:Lost World.  The animal from the movie looked very similar.  The detail on the model is excellent.  The model is smaller than some of Papo's other dinosaur figures but is still done very well.  The model is durable and comparable to other companies such as Safari.  If you know or are a dinosaur fan this is a great model to have.
0,1,Quality not great.. The screws are not good the truck is falling apart.I have to use glue.Too many parts too many screws.An adult has to assemble this takes over an hour.Kid is sitting trying to put it together and can't.I can't understand the use of this toy.The kid can't put it together and once it is together doesn't work that well.. keeps falling apart.Poor design poor toy
0,1,"Our 2yr old is enamored with trash trucks - therefore, we picked this up for his birthday gift.  Since our tot is too young to assemble the truck, my husband, a professional bicycle mechanic, was charged with putting it together before the party.  It took my mechanically capable husband almost 2 hours to assemble it.  However - it was completely worth the effort.  This was (and, a month later, still is) our toddler's favorite toy.  He loves the fact that it comes with a trash can and trash that dump into the truck - just like a ""real"" trash truck.  I would, without hesitation, recommend this toy...just allow yourself some time for assembly.  :)"
0,1,This was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She loves farm animals and was the perfect size for her 1 year old hands....she is 2 now and still plays with it.
1,0,This puzzle was perfect for my 1 yr old. Nice solid wooden pieces and very well made at a great price. Would highly recommend.
0,1,"Great addition to you collection and of the highest collector quality you would expect of Papo!  Nice LARGE size, great match for a good fight with the Papo adult T-rex.  It's a bit on the heavy side.  Very durable, horns and frill are pretty much undamaged even though they have rammed the T-Rex every day since purchase weeks ago.  If I were to buy just two Papo dinos, I would say it would be this and the T-Rex.  Definitely a must have."
0,1,"Love this item! Sturdy, easy to put together, my child's favorite! The only con is that the pictures glued on the pieces of wood come off at the corners after 10 uses or more! I cannot glue them back because they are shredded by use. Melissa & Doug, I suggest a sturdier film applied on the jigsaw pieces!!"
0,1,"Love the colors and work of art on this piece. Suited for young builder like our son who enjoys endless time with his puzzles. We particularly appreciate jigsaw puzzles by Melissa and Doug as they are durable, sturdy and easy to clean with a sanitizing wipe during the seasons of cold and flu."
0,1,"While I like this product a lot and always have even as a kid, it was a bit much for my 4 year old to comprehend.  Going in an out with the provided tool seemed a bit too difficult for her.  Just an FYI"
1,0,"I am SO sick of potholders.  I bought this for my daughter for her 8th birthday in September.  I have since purchased two refill loop bags and she is asking for more this Christmas.  It keeps her busy for hours.  She is so proud of her work and she loves to give them away.  Grandma, grandpa, aunts, friends and teachers are all proud recipients of her work.  Her 2 year old sister uses them to play with her dolls as blankets and rugs.  I never thought potholders would be so interesting!!!  Too funny."
0,1,"I bought this for my two year old nephew.  It is well constructed.  The animal figures give him the ability to match head to body so he can figure out how to put it back together.  Good, simple puzzle."
0,1,These puzzles are very well made.  Our son loves to play with them and they can withstand his abuse. We recommend this type for 18-30 month old children.
0,1,This is a good sturdy puzzle. My daughter loves Puzzles and Melissa and Doug is such a great brand. I wasn't disappointed.
0,1,"This is probably a great toy but i got it for my two year old and it was rather confusing and he was never interested in it.  Also, it is a little confusing to me.  Does that sound dense?  I would say this puzzle is for a five year old and up.  it might be fun to drive around the cars but they are always turning upside down, etc.  which ads to the confusing nature of it."
1,0,"My kids ages 2-8 have loved playing with this. Honestly, I don't understand it. I can't see what would be so fun about moving pieces around a puzzle. Though I would even find myself unable to control the temptation to move them back to the correct spot... obsessive compulsive.. who knows?? :o) It has held up well for about 6 months of play and still looks great. They have to learn to move cars out of the way to get them to new spots. Very good for thinking and planning. Great manipulation and crossover brain work (when hands cross the center part of the body) for a hand to move a car across the board. This type of puzzle comes in many styles. You can find one to fit your child's personality."
0,1,"The only thing bad about this maze puzzle is that my girls (ages 1 and 3) fight over it! I like that it uses the same skills that they would use to solve a puzzle, but presents new challenges, and incorporates some pretend play (the school bus travels from home to school; the grocery truck picks up the grocery and delivers them to the house)."
1,0,I bought this for my grandson and he plays with them all he time.  He especially likes to put them on my Queen Anne furniture and race them.  Since he is my grandson I indulge him.  The toys are great!
0,1,This model looks very life-like. The coloring and the features are great. My grandsons are really into dinos and he is very popular with them.
0,1,Even though the features are thin they have stood up to rough play.  Great addition to you collection and of the highest collector quality you would expect of Papo!
0,1,"I purchased this set of X-Ray films for my 5 year old daughter. For the last two years, she has been saying that she will be a Radiographer. (She actually says x-ray doctor.) She has gone as far to ask my orthopedic surgeon for ""extra x-rays"" and he complied. So having human x-rays lying around the house is nothing new for us. The best thing is you can lay out all the x-rays to for a complete human skeleton."
0,1,The kids loved seeing these and being able to get up close and personal! It was a huge hit! We will be pulling these out for the next group when it comes time to cover this unit again as we use it for a preschool program and I know they will be just excited!
0,1,"we love MD and this is not an exception...great little gift for girls birthday.  great price, great item.  we love it"
0,1,I purchased this as a gift for one of my daughters friends.  She seemed to really like it and it looked nice in the package.  Not sure how it worked out since we were not the ones to use it.  But I would like to add that after purchasing it I found it at a large toy store for $2 less--so you may want to price before buying.
0,1,"I got this for my 4 year old grand daughter.  I know she will love it, but it could  have allowed for more personalization.  I'm happy this was made of wood as I try to avoid plastic, but it's a little beneath the skills of a 4 year old."
0,1,What little girl does not want a princess mirror of her own to decorate? Certainly not my two girls. They love this mirror.
0,1,"Our 2YO has moved past the 12 pieces (mostly) and on to the 24 piece puzzles.  While they are pretty, easy to figure out, and constructed well overall, the pieces are a little roughly cut and so getting them together and apart the first 10 or 20 times is difficult. When you're child isn't sure if two pieces go together they need to fit well.  With this puzzle they don't fit great when they are supposed to and he gets confused."
0,1,"I chose this puzzle because it's wood and not chipboard. Chipboard puzzles start to bend after use and I thought wood would hold up better. It's a nice little puzzle, but I have to mention that little specks of wood does come off the puzzle.. especially during the first few uses. And the picture does start to lift - we've had to glue a few sections back down and some edges the paper with the picture wasn't repairable. But the puzzle still works and a 2 year old is playing with it over and over - it's not going to last forever."
1,0,"The puzzle is a good education toy but built with bad quality.  The first time we take the pieces apart, we broke one piece and we broke more as we play."
0,1,My 3 year old loves this puzzle. Not too hard and I love when puzzles are durable. Sturdy for toddlers to play with.
1,0,"I keep a bunch of these in my restaurant activity bags along with the usual crayons, coloring pages, and stickers.  It's a good activity for adults and kids to interact and create things together.  I suggest really looking at the idea paper that comes in the package b/c of course the first time we were out and had a chance to use them all I could think of to make was  a square, circle, triangle, the usual.  Boring.  My kids like when I make eyeglasses, hearts linked together, and spiders.  They're fun when you start getting creative."
0,1,"This is great if you are like me and have a little boy obsessed with monsters, but to use as a bowling set is not possible. The bottoms of each monster are rounded and the monster pins do not stand unsupported. The ball is not completely round so it doesnt roll very well, but the colors are fun and if you have a 12 month old that prefers wandering around with one or two of these monster pins than actually playing, then this is a great toy."
0,1,My grandson was so surprised and so thrilled with the monsters. He loved the entire set even though he didn't figure out that it was a bowling game. Each monster is so wonderful and so soft. He loved it.
0,1,"These are cloth, and so when they fall over, they are quiet. My son would be a lot more excited about this, I think, if you could hear them as they were getting knocked to the floor."
0,1,"Okay toy, very cute. But bowling pins fall down when trying to set them up and my child gets bored of this game quickly."
1,0,"Bought this for my 3 year old and he loves it. The monsters are cute, and it's easy for him to set up by himself. Comes in a nice zippered plastic bag so it's easy to store as well. Melissa & Doug toys are the best!!"
0,1,I absolutely love this toy!  I first found it on amazon years ago and I have been giving it as a gift to one year old boys and girls ever since.  I like it because it's a unisex unique gift that the kids love.  All of the parents tell me that their kids love this toy and both my son and daughter also like playing with it. I would probably recommend this product more than anything else I've ever bought on amazon.
0,1,"I purchased this used - like new &#34;some damage to box&#34; and it arrived in perfect condition. Its a LARGE engine (I don't know much about trains and was expecting something much smaller.) We got this to ride around the bottom of our tree, and it works perfectly for that purpose. My 3 year old son did knock it off the tracks easily when he tried to play with it, and he needed our help to get it back on. Just keep that in mind if the train will be for every day play. The engine seems to be made of metal, and the cars are plastic. Comes with 4 figurines. This was a big hit, as our son LOVES Polar Express and is really into trains right now."
0,1,"Last Christmas This set was all my son wanted (he was 6yrs old). He was very excited to receive it and a year later it is still in use and still gets his undivided attention. This year all he wants is more track for a longer train ride! At 6-7 yrs he is able to connect the trains when they come apart and he doesn't seem to mind (even real trains need some maintenance). If the track is on cushy carpet it will have a hard time staying up, because it is a good solid plastic train it is a bit top heavy. I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 5, I don't think they would have the patients for this level of train. I believe Lionel makes another simpler PE train for youner kids. But for the $$ this G guage is a great alternative to the O guage train!"
1,0,These are so cute and well made. My daughter loved them from the beginning but now she loves them even more that she can figure out the tops. So very cute that they are magnetic.
0,1,"I have boy/girl 19 mo old twins and they LOVE these magnetic ""bottles.""  Before they received these toys they loved playing with caps on real food items but the caps were often too small to safely play with.  These are cute, well made, and they really enjoy playing with them."
0,1,"We bought this kitchen for my 3 year daughter for christmas and she loves it!  It took some time for my husband to put it together, but he was surprised by how easy it was.  The time consuming part was really due to all the screws.  The instructions we super simple.  Each piece is numbered in the order you use it and the holes are color coded so it is very clear how the pieces go together.  What really stuck me once the kitchen was together was how much storage there is between the fridge, cabinet and below the sink.  I bought a bin to put under the sink and some little ones for the frige.  All of my daughters kitchen stuff fits in with plenty of room to grown!  I love Melissa & Doug's products, but this kitchen makes me love them even more!"
0,1,"This was one of the first presents our daughter opened on Christmas and she didn't stop playing with them! Everyone else loved it too. I knew this set would be a hit with my 14-month old because she loves removing her bottle cap and putting it back on again. She also does this repetitively with every other lid she manages to get her hands on.These are pretty cool, as they come with magnetic lids (although the rather heavy wooden bottles do fall off if you try to hold them by the lids). The whole set is pretty much life-sized and made of smooth, solid wood. There's Jam, Hot Dog Mustard, Tomato Ketchup, Olive Oil, and Salad Dressing.I love that the lids and bottles are color-coordinated, so it teaches her colors and matching skills. The pictures on the bottles are cute too! However, unlike one of the other reviewers had remarked, a couple of the larger lids do fit on the smaller protruding bottle ""necks"", so it's not entirely error-proof.The only problem I had was, after just two days of play, the paint on the green piece, in particular, had started to come off (bottom corners of the bottle, as well as the lid). While on the bottle, the paint was not exactly chipping/flaking (more like it had rubbed off), there was a spot on the lid where the woodgrain had splintered and the paint chipped off, perhaps due to not being sanded down properly.I would still rate the durability 4 stars, because this may just be a one-off defect and overall, the quality isn't bad. Also, we believe wooden toys are made to last (more so than ""crappy plastic toys"", as my husband says).I hope Amazon will start shipping Melissa & Doug's toys/merchandise to New Zealand, so I don't have to purchase from third-party sellers (whose orders are fulfilled by Amazon anyway). That way, if a product is defective, Amazon can send a replacement from their inventory."
0,1,"While there are pieces on this toy which can get lost, I chalk it up to the idea of teaching a youngster (or anyone) firearm responsibility which extends to gathering one's brass. Functions really well (for a nerf toy) and shoots about as far as you'd expect (30 feet?). Good fun."
