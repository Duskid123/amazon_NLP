61674,0,1,3,small world pretty much everything thought going fun game killing fantasy races special powers small world theres much room everyone one big thing hurts game strategy almost nil isnt isnt actually importantbasic play player starts victory coins whomever end game wins races laid randomly combined special powers players pick laid combos combo top draw decks player gets tokens chosen combo enters board edge map conquering area easy every area requires least tokens conquer token mountain region enemy unit x whatever racespecial powers subsequent attack must done adjacent territory redeploy troops however like territories make harder conquer get coins equal number areas control racespecial powers beginning next turn pick extra tokens point run low tokens need take whole turn go decline longer use race anymore anything though still earn coins territory theyre allows pick new racespecial power combo reenter board next turn game lasts set number rounds depending number playerscomponents lot components game double sided boards one players one players tokens races race banners special powers victory coins die bunch little things racespecial powers everything seems sturdy durable worried anything breaking insert game somewhat annoying special power banners go top slot designed stuff elsewhere also tray tokens come races nothing like shown rulebook instead specifically designed slots race bunch separate big small slots put might seem nice races lot tokens cant fit slot without causing plastic lid fit correctly youll separate races separate slots annoying rulebook quite nice though laid good manner pages actual rules also handy player summary sheets included show races powers one side show turn order goes lid game seems extremely fragile arrived fine condition lid frayed around bunch edges making look really beat havent done anything caused much damagelength expect minutes gamereplayability hard say one enjoy game one get craving often dont ever want play one game time people play dont seem request often though enjoy playing itluck theres really whole lot luck involved game thing random way races powers come together since pick time isnt big deal everything turn figured real luck comes final attack turn long one token left attack attempt take area using reenforcement die die blank sides sides either dot dots dots simply add number rolled remaining tokens determines whether successfully take areainteraction youll killing game long much else say heremy thoughts pros since races special powers always randomly combined almost impossible games combos also one blank race one blank special power banners use make races special powers play game youll find races love using special powers youll always want using dragon conquer area matter many defenders fun using sorcerers power convert enemy token side two double sided boards included nice changes shape size world little bit depending many people youre playing one going get mad someone else attacking attacking someone else game lighthearted war game setup pretty easy quickmy thoughts cons mention races powers theres luck must strong strategy game right unfortunately choices make game generally moot yeah might get couple coins turn certain races powers ultimately whether win lose game going determined whether people primarily attack theres way defend territories someone else wants take area stopping lose enough units youre going choice go decline since one race decline time completely wipe prior race cant really force players attack person think winning cant really stop ganging want going happen ultimately person wins usually going person didnt get ganged left alone often best strategy example played game brand new players night final scores game moderate strategy level would allow many new players anywhere near close methe dwarves severely underpowered race get tokens always ignored time someone picks enough coins people skipped advantage get extra points mines even decline get pieces hard get mines near impossible get morethey really could provided blank tokens something use custom race create youll forced use one races game represent custom race use whichever race bottom stack possible could pop someone pick go decline youll switch tokens another dead races onesnot good player game youll spend turns attacking forcing decline youll remove diplomat power play playersthey included mountain pieces youre supposed put mountain spaces game board remind mountains take token usual conquer waste never use themfinal thoughts like easy setup like picking races powers like using races powers enjoy quick simple combat easy rules player summary sheets incredibly useful well put together like rolling reenforcement die try take last region simple game explain new players play complicated thing races powers given summary sheet check time since strategy doesnt matter much gives new players decent chance win first time playing wouldnt recommend player game sweet spot usually players fun im playing game never really crave play ultimately cant get past fact nothing planned seems matter game thats meant played enjoyed
