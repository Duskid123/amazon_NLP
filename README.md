This repo was made to make a NLP project to be able to determine wheather a review for a product is positive 4 or 5 out of 5 or if it is a negative review 1,2, or 3 out of 5.

I used the Pandas library to be able to load the data from the csv file to be able to get the relevant columns.

I used sklearn library for the actual NLPKT functionalites: models, metric testing, train and test splitting ...

I had to split the data to be able to load the csv files to github which is a janky fix.
